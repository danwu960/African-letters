Peace.19850927_page_1.txt,Oshakati,"namibians are not
brainwashed

| weep for my country,
which has been conquered by
force, and in which oppression and
immorality reigns supreme. the
country in which people have lost
their human dignity, the country
where we are nov treated like
foreigners ...

if anyone enjoys a bit of luck or
finds himself a little better off, im-
mediately his heart grows hard. in
our time people who think only of
themselves are wicked.

no one knows my despair, save
he who knows ail, but my heart is
in a perpetual state of anguish.

our oppressors should know
that namibians are not brain-
washed and we will never be blind-
folded. justbecause we smile and
smile, and happiness is our coat,
they think we are gateposts, numb
to the stab of pain.

just because of the laughter on-

our lips and our eyes lowered in
respect, you think we are like

stones.

this is our fatherland which has
been pillaged by foreign con-
querors who have exploited and
grown rich on the spoils of our
nation.

itis time to abolish apartheid. let
our brothers in south africa enjoy
peace, equality, freedom and
justice.

let the world know our problems,
and let us share our problems with
them. let us demand the im-
plementation of resolution 435, so
that victory for namibia will be
achieved.

Peace.19850927b_page_1.txt,Windhoek,"progressives should
combine forces

! would like to congratulate
the staff of the namibian on their
success. keep it up.

secondly, | would tike to ex-
press my views with regard tothe
political situationin our country.

namibia has become a politi-
cal object of the international im-
perialists, and itis essential that
we get rid of them.

consider mysett a progressive
and would like to encourage the
progressives in this country to
maintain and tighten the existing
cooperation among us, which
will lead to political unity.

we have a common identity
and common problems which we
can only solve when we are polit-
leafly united.

let us stop demanding minor
reforms like open hotels and
bers, and instead strive for total

and national indepen-
dence of the namibian people.

let us also distance ourselves
trom our various political ideol-

ogles. wecan pursue these after
independence.

the south african govern-
ment has embarked on a strate-
gy of political intolerance and the
suppression of any opposition
from progressives. in order to
counter this, we have to combine
forces so that they give the
government to the peopte.

let us unite in order to force
south africa to relinquish her
colonial positionin namibia. our
compatriots in south africa have
setusan example, andthe ques-
tion for us is ‘where is our udf,
and who are the boesaks and tu-
tus of namibia?’.

the time has come for us to
complete the circte in our strug-
gle against imperialism, tribal-
ism and colonialism.

we must not wait for anyone to
come to our ald. we must not be
demoralised by the mpc who
clalm to bring about peace and
national reconciliation. we have

seen how members of koevoet
beat up our people in katutura
and how mr dawid bezuldenhout
called for the continued deten-
tlon of josef katofa. all these
deeds confirm the intention of
the mpc which is to silence
everyone who disagrees with
them.

my assessment is that the mpc
is the ‘strong arm’ of south afri-
ca, used to further its colonialin-
terests in namibia. the members
of the mpc do not represent the
namibians but only their coloni-
al masijars.

people of namibia, let us stand
up and show them we do not
need a further hijacking of our
freedom.

we have many peacetul ways
at our disposal by means of
which we can fight against the
system. let us rally oursetvesbe-
hind our leaders to achieve the
freedom of this country, let us
fight for peace, justice and anon-
exploitative society.

would like to appeal to fellow capriv-

the colonisers create a situation

blinded all caprivians so that they
have failed to recognise developmen-

with the recent propaganda
against swapo onthe part of the dta
mouthpiece, | would like to bring the
following to the attention of the
public.

the facts about swapo in that
mouthpiece are manipulated and
propagandistic in nature. the whites
who sit behind this propaganda are
exploiting the lack of knowledge of
our people. i

in 1899 to 1902 the afrikaners
fought the boer war. let me mention
some factors in connection with this:

* the guerrilla war of 1899 to 1902 was
the tirst significant one in africa:
“it was learned from them that guns
could be taken upasa last resort and
when all other possibilities had been
exhausted;

* h-year old children fought in that
war;

* with their calvanistic back ground,
they saw their war as rightful before
god;

* the afrikaners did not separate
politics and religion;

* they were convinced they fought for
their country and freedom,

* the homes and farms of the

afrikaners were burned down by the
enemy british;

* women and children were placed in
concentration camps, where more
than 22000 children under the age of

16 are alleged to have died;

* hensoppers were regarded as
traitors while bittereindes fought to
the finish;

* the traitors were sometimes

sentenced to death by firing squad;

* the afrikaners were distrustful of
the english and thetr peace
imitiatives:

* children of traitors could not be
baptised in the dutch reformed
church.

taking this into account, why the
fuss about the fact that swapo ts
holding their traitors tn detention, in
uch better condinions than these of
“he afrikaners during the boer war?

already, deep in the national par-
ty hierarchy, inthe np church, there
iy a change against apartheid. they
are now beginning to realise the ir-
reparable damage done to the black
by means of apartheid.

view the propaganda of the
republican party with caution. itis
the broederbond’s psychological
war against swapo. swapo will not
be broken. shipanga and muyongo
tried it and failed. do you think
maria boois and beukes will get it
right?

you have given vice bishop
kamecta space in your newspaper to
volce his opinion. i request thesame
opportunity since you call yourself
achamplon for freedom of speech.

mr kameceta claims that the in-
dependence of namibia is an in-
alienable right, and that itisdemand-
ed without conditions attached. he
iscight, but why does he, and his par-
ty, swapo, refuse to acknowledge any
other political opinion in this de-
mand for independence?

why doesn't mr kameeta use his
high office to ensure justice, peace
and freedom for eery namibian?
he is aware of the fact that swapo
does not tolerate opposition. he
knows that everybody opposing
swapo will be subject to arbitrary
punishment or even execution
without a fair trial. mr kameeta
should support the call made by the
namibian on swapotoensurea fair
hearing for those who are accused of
being spies for south africa.

mr kameeta should be aware of
the fact that many political parties in
nainibia have urged swapoto be an
equal partner in their opposition to
south africa. he should also know
that swapo refuses to drop the adjec-

tive ‘sole and authentic represen.

tative of the people of namibia’. ms
lister should inform mr kameeta of
what her experiences are concerning
this imposed status on swapo. mr
kameeta, who has vowed to preach
love, peace and righteousness,
should be inthe front to ensure that
every namibia be granted the right
andthe opportunity to work towards
independence of this country.

mr kameeta knows that swapo
regards violence as the only viable
means of allaining independence tor
namibia, but does he consider the
fact that the majority people in this
country are peaceloving christians
and thus prefer a negotiated
settlement?

mr kamecta calls for boycotts and
disinvestment and calls the potential
suffering of the majority of people
‘empty phrases’. simullaneously this
vice bishop demands that ‘all peo-
ple must have the right to decent
housing, and bring up their families
incomfort and secunty. free medica!
care and hospitalisation must be pro-
vided for all, with special care for

senior citizens, mothers and small
children. the aged and disabled must
be fully cared for by the state’,

has it occurred to mr kameeta
that foreign investment is vital to
achieve these aims” mr kameeta ts
fully aware of the fact that swapo
and the ccn regularly call on inter-
national financial support to
alleviate the plight of the people.
why then should only his party and
is followers benefit from financial
aid and not the majority of the
people?

will mr kameeta care to tell the
public how much he earns and how
much he pays i taxes? will mr
kamecta be prepared to inform the
people of this country about the
lifestyle of those who profess to fight
tor independence and liberation
about ther contribution towards the
alleviation of the suffering peaplein
the form of financial contributions?

can mr kamectainform the publicof

whathe proposes shauld be done to
obtain sufficient funds to attain what
all the people in namibia desire?
mr contention is that swapo is
guilty of the most atrocious
discrimination against people. mr
kameeta is actively engaged in
swapo's political activities, this
inakes him guilty of discriminating
against his own people too, accor-

ding to the oxford dictionary,
discrimination means to ‘make a
distinction, to give unfair treatment,
especially because of prejudice’.
swapo and mr kameeta call
everybody who does not comply with
their conditions and with their opi-
mons, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pels etc. everybody who dares to
speak against swapo is threatened
and intimidated. every person who
does not support swapo is being
discriminated against. this ts
definitely not what the majority of
namibians will support: this is what
the majority ofthe namubians want
eradicated,

mr kameecta claims his fame and
right to speak about political matters
on his attest and detention. for any
law-abiding citizen, especially for
devoted christians, defiance of the
lawis detestable. if mr kamectaasa
vice bishop and even more as a
swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
ahenable right to self-determination,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not suppartan
organisation which sees only
violence as a moans of achieving

what they desire, namely, to take over
power of this country.
mr nujoma has declared more

than once that swapo is not in-
\erested in powersharing, but onlyin
power itself, during his recent pro-
paganda tour for swapo in west ger-
many, mr kameeta has proven that
heis against any form of opposition
to swapo and that he disputes the
right of freedom of speech of a ger-
man citizen in his own country. with

this act added to his political antics

against the people of this country, mr

kameeta has disqualified himselfof
claiming to be a champion for
freedom, justice and peace.

apparently did not realise his use of

ing them you don’t want a civil war
in namibia. is it not a civil war
which ts beng fought in the north?

mr katjiuongua, try and address
yourself to the real facts and pull
yourself out of that pool of
stupidity. .

it you try to be objective and
realistic, you would not be worried
about the positive actions of pro-

gressive parties aimed at the speedy
implementation of resolution 43$.

people know what you stand for
and your empty promises of a ‘new
deal’ will not make the people
suscepuble to this cheap propagan-
da. you and your colleagues are

and this makes you more reckless
than ever.

if you consider yourself a na-

assure you that there will be no
tranquility in namibia as long as
we are being ruled by a foreign
power through the mpc. the

you cannot claim peace in a state
of continuous institutionalised
state violence and unemployment.

security and not torture and deten-

tion without tril. give the people

their right to practice self

false statement

please permit me to answer to
the embarrassing statement
swapo does the same, but nobody
complains .... in the namibian of
may 16.

the angry residents and their
tribal chief, in and around om-
balantu in northern namibia, are
totally against the actions of the
south african police and defence
force and not against swapo.

obviously the people in the
north are annoyed by the south
afncan police and defence force’s
“systematic and cleverly planned’
manner of waiting until the
harvesting period before these units
come in and destroy their many
months of hard work.

in windhoek, the police
spokesman’s comment on the in-
cidents, in my reasoning, is alarm-
ing. his words ‘... swapo does the
same but nobody complains ..’ are
absurd and embarrassing and
perhape deliberately said to ignore
the complaints and the truth of the

the statement ‘swapo does the
same’ is patently false since swapo

has no military vehicles, which ac-
cording to the complaints, the
sadf drove through mahangu
fields and homesteads. how can
someone from the north be ex-
pected to believe such a statement?

while the police and army claim
to be the defenders of the people,
the namibians themselves have re-
jected this claim, since namibians
have experienced untold crimes at
the hands of these forces. these
cannot be erased from our minds

we do fear the action of these
forces and call for the immediate
withdrawal of south african police
and army. we want peace, justice
and truth and this can be im-
plemented through resolution 435.

the namibians have tasted the
colonial fruit of the south african
government and its puppet institu-
tions in namibia, and it tastes
bitter.

plight of namibia

namibian independence is
delayed by the entire western world
with their intentions of exploiting
our country's natural resources and
promoting the inegal occupation of
namibia by the south african
government.

in 1978 the united nations pass-
ed a resoluuon (unscr 435)
which was to pave the way for our
independence through un-
supervised elections.

both swapo and south africa
had agreed to the implementation
of resolution 435, but when
reagan came {0 power in
washington, he and south africa
brought in the linkage issue. this
is now made a precondition to our
independence.

the cuban internationalists
have been in angola almost three
years prior to the introduction of
resolution 435. they were only
found to be a threat after six years.

this is a feeble excuse and ploy
by western capitalists regarding
namubia.

we in namibia have tried on-
three occasions to bring and end to
the shedding of blood and the suf-
fering of our people, but all were
in vain. in geneva in 1981, swapo
was ready to sign a ceasefire and
put resolution 435 into operauion,
and this was repeated in lusaka in
1984 and on cape verde later that
year, but the south african
government turned a deal ear.

mr p w botha told the world
that swapo was the one delaying
independence and opting for
violence, whereas swapo had stated
often that a ceasefire was the only
way to end the war.

if mr p w botha could just tell
us openly that he is afraid of a
swapo victory if resolution 438 ts
implemented. swapa would win
the elections overwhelmingly,
which 16 why the reagan adc-
ministrauon is backing pretoria on
the cuban tssue.

the south african government
is again playing with us by saying
that swapo must talk to the interim
government in windhoek. why
should swapo talk to their sur-
rogates? the country is not oc-
cupied by mudge-shipanga-

over the years, when apartheid
was in its raw stages, it was mark-
ed with doors for ‘whites only’.
‘whites only’ could enter these
doors, regardless of their religion,
social standing, tradition or race.

the only precondition was that
the skin colour be ‘white’.

the man with the black skin had
to keep away from ‘your’ regions
and reservations.

1 will not ask what you have
against the colour of my skin, mr
becker. by maintaining this rigid
attitude, you have made your
message clear to the blacks of
namibia. as far as you are con-
cerned, there is no compromise on
apartheid without a colour change.

ironically, the very segregation
you are now seeking, was provid-
ed in the past. someone was wise
enough to foresee conflicting
nature of the white man and black
man, and kept them apart. your
forbears were in holland and there
the chances of keeping vour race
pure, were perfect

on what grounds can you now
fence in the black man to safeguard
the punty of your white race if you,
yourself, have broken the natural
segregation by crossing the ocean?

of course we dare not overlook
the fact that your forbears brought
the first hight of christian faith and -
civilisation into the most southern *
part of africa. this opened our
eyes (o new horizons of education,
civilisation, faith and progress.

incidentally, the white man also
introduced to us the first spark of
the gun, the very evil he suffers
under today. in fact the mass
slaughter of blacks on december 16
1836, is a testive day for your
government - contrary to the chris-
han faith which strives for peace,
love and unity.

you came to africa, heavily
armed and with apartheid.

surely you are an advocate of
‘whites only’ churches, a religion
practised, understood and accep-
(able to only a small part of the
community. with the help of god
we have partly outgrown that stage.

lastly mr becker, your thoughts
jo not justify your existence in
africa, unless you change them
and bring them into the open. —

allow me to express my views
on messrs andreas shipanga,
moses katjiuongua, and fanuel
kozonguizi, about their positions
and what they are doing to the sul-
fering namibian people.

as a brother and fellow coun-
tryman, i would be guilty if | did
not state my views in regard to your
present positions, labelled as
cabinet ministers by an unelected
interim government appointed by
the south african government, be-
ing used as carriers of apartheid
and collaborators of the south
african government; and being us-
ed to oppress the already oppress-
ed suffering namibian people, your
own people, your own blood.

did you know you are delaying
the country’s independence by
allowing yourselves to be used by
the south african government
which is still exploiting our natural

civilian population. :

how did you feel at the. time,
giving approval to an army of
occupation?

brothers, 1 want to remind you
that your forerunners, ard others
who have sold out to the enemy,
are forgotten, and were
like rotten fruit to the dustbin. you
should seriously reconsider your
positions in opposing your own
people.

you know you don’t have the
support of even two percent of the
namibian people, so please open
the doors for resolution 435 to
clect our leaders. we know them
well.

my message (oo peace-loving
namibians is that they should unite
and fight the darkness of evil
among us. let us fight for our
future generations, and leave
money and cars to the sellouts.

who is very disappointed male his

1 was told i could get a job i in the
building construction industry in
tsumeb, and had to see a man at
the tsumeb municipality. he told
me to come back the following
morning at 07h00, which i did, and
he made me wait all day. i was
eventually told i could not get the
job, and then after a friend of mine
again requested, i was told to go
to the municipality once again.

when | did so, the man told me
there were no jobs for ovambo-
speaking people, but only
damaras, namas and coloureds.

some of our brothers in govern-
ment offices treat others on a tribal
and discriminatory basis. while the
ovambo-speaking people are those
who are suffering the most, one has
to hear that they are ‘thieves and
terrorists’, and they are
discriminated against in job
situations.

| had used my own money to go
to tsumeb for that job, and had no
place to sleep and nothing to eat.

blacks always blame the whites
for discrimination and racism, but
some of our own people, like the
one who dealt with me at the
municipality, are oppressing their
own people.

we should learn from these
mistakes so we should not make the
same mistakes tn the future.

our country is torn by war and
this situation will only be resolved
if the people of the country can
work hand in hand for peace. this
peace will only come through love,

sanctions: yes

thre call tor total cconomic
sanctions against apartherd south
atnica is justified. south africa has
rejected all reasonable demands to
do away with the outdated and
degrading system of apartheid and
oppression of the blacks.

the promoters of economic
sanctions have the real interests of
the oppressed masses of south
africa and namibia at heart; and
economic sancuons is the alter-
native to total war. in fact
economic sanctions is a call for
‘peaceful change’ to enable the
blacks to govern in the land of their
birth and creation.

those who are against economic
sanctions are only trying to protect
their own interests and exploitation
of the blacks. the claim that the
blacks would suffer if economic
sancuions were applied, should be
rejected with the contempt it
deserves. the blacks are suffering
already and additional temporary
suffering won’t matter to us as long
as freedom is achieved.

the blacks have no economic in-
terests to protect and defend - their
main interest now is to liberate
themselves at all costs.

the us and british attitude is
clearly capitalistic and self-interest
aimed at protecting the in-
vestments. the fear of economic
loss is stronger to them than the
freedom and lives of the blacks in
apartheid south africa. it ig
because of the double standards of
the western powers that blacks
have lost interest in slogans like
‘democracy’ blacks lived in peace
and harmony until the arrival of
the white settlers and colonisers.

it fills one with dismay to hear
about blacks saying that apartheid
is dead in namibia. apartheid in
namibia as still alive and kicking,
even the socalled black ‘ministers’
complain about apartheid meted
outto them by secretaries of other
“mintsters’,

the abolition of apartheid is not
what we are calling for - we are not
fighting for reforms - we want to
govern this country. we are
fighting for the nght to decide our
own destiny and our destiny 1s not
linked to apartheid or neo-
colomalism.

the whites of this country are
not prepared to change or ready
themselves for change. they still
believe in their oppressive doctrines
und dogmas.

even the secretary for finance
is calling for methods to prepare
against economic sanchons, instead
of calling for drastic changes in the
status quo in order to meet the
reasonable demands of the op-
pressed masses.

the whites must remember one
thing: they may be in a temporary
postion to delay independence. dut
thes cannot present

the whites are shouting that they
ate hehting on the border (o defend
them rotten sytem of apartheid.
they should femember that we
never invited them here with their
oppressive system, and now they
ure calling on us blacks to defend
and fight to retain oppression and
apartheid.

we hear that the army 1s 80 per-
cent black and 20 percent white -
but who are the 20 percent? they
are the elite, the white officers, the
ones in charge. the 80 percent
blacks are there only to run errands
and to be ordered to kill their own
kith and kin.

if the whites are prepared to die
for what is not theirs, what about
us who have a country to regain
and a people to liberate? whites
should remember that violence
breeds violence - they have practis-
ed violence since the first white
man put his foot on namibian soil
and have not stopped ever since. in
fact they have accelerated it. blame
for any violence or bloodshed
should be placed squarely at the
door of the whites.

the barbarous bomb attack on innocent

nobody expects you as a christian to
take sides in the struggle over

should condemn all forms of violence.
you did not and have never before con-

granted that vou condone one form of
violence and condemn another suiting
your own political whims and
aspirations.

as the majority of my countrymen
i condemn violence of any form to
achieve political aims. nobody denies
that members of the security forces do
commit violence against members of the
local population. such members are
however brought before court and | can
substantiate this statement with a list of

i] would like to respond to a report
in the interim government propagan-
da mouthpiece of november 3, which
criticised church-run schools in the
territory.

mr andrew matjila, education
minister, said that we were disad-
vantaged hecause we were
undernourished.

church schools are contributing
much to our country, and our eves
and minds are kept open in these
schools. we have a fair system of
education, and we feel at home.

coming to mr matjila’s point that
we are locked into our hostels: this
is not true. everyone has the right
to go home with the permission of
staff members, and this is a sign of
order. we are protected by the church
as future leaders of this country. .

truly speaking, we are thankful for
the good we are getting. we eat in
order to survive and not to get fat as
he is doing. if he wants to make us
fat, then they have to implement a
system of equal education in this
country.

mr matjila should also not confuse
himself about swapo and the coun.
cil of churches. they are using the
money for peaceful means, while he
and his colleagues have grabbed
possession of the country, including
the education system.

he and his colleagues spent a for-
tune on military training, while peo-

where the supporters of swapo were
routed by what is generally known
here as koevoet.

i was invited to the peace rally (sic)

swapo police! dreesed resplendently,
some with wooden ak-47 rifles,
painted blue, green and red. tradi-
tional kieries and spears (covered with
cooldrink cans to make gure the sharp
points cause no incidental harm).

the peace rally was opened with o
prayer. an old black man, praying in
afrikaans, for the rally to be peaceful
and in the name of god. there were
some speeches and then a group of
socalled vigilantes started injuring
people and damaging cars in the road.
they were chased away by the swapo
police and we all started singing again,
determined to allow peace to get the
upper hand.

the next moment casspirs arrived
much too s00n to have been summon-

close and ready. the hatches flew open
and the firing started. horribly sud-

distortions

the articles in the interim
government mouthpiece of 11.12.86
and 19.12.86, are malicious and a
blatant distortion of the truth. the
allegation against mr shapua
kaukungua is that paper's own
fabrication. they are writing what
they probably wanted to hear. | am
not surprised by these lies, because
a system based on lies, cannot be
defended with the truth.

l repeat my statement made in the
evangelical lutheran church in
katutura at mr shifidi's funeral that
the “socalled government of national
unity is morally responsible for his
death”. the death of mr shifidi is an
urgent call on this ‘government’ to
step down, and in so doing, allow the
implementation of unsc resolution
435.

as long as this ‘government’ is in
power, it will be responsible for the
blood of the namibians which has
been soaking the soil for more than
a century. what happened on that
fateful sunday of november 30 last
year was not a mere ‘bakleiery’ as
that newspaper pretends. which is
why we are demanding an indepen-
dent judicial commission of inquiry
to reveal the truth.

i challenge mr eben van zijl and
his government to allow the appoint-
ment of such a commission if ita (the
government) conscience is clear on
what happened that day.

without justice there will be no
reconciliation and peace in namibia.

for us, the
masses of namibia, i it is now time to
reflect on the happenings of the past
year. waa it a successful year as far
_ as the struggle is concerned? did we
achieve what we set out to achieve,
and if not why?

first of all we must find answers
to these questions before we can plan
for the new year. the aim of our plan-

should be to make a success out
of failures of the past and to
achieve our independence. it is aleo
now time for us to state our aims and
purpose as clearly as never before.
we should state our views without
fear or favour.

our aim was and is and always
shall be the independence of our
country. it must be every namibian’s
wish and desire to be free ... and |
mean free in the real sense of the
word.

our independence is not
negotiable. we have negotiated for
too long hence the long delay in ob-
taining our desired independence.
our direction should be very clear ...
independence now and at all costs.
we should stop these half-hearted ef.
forts. we should go all out to liberate
our country.

the call and onus is on us to unite
the divided people of namibia into
one cohesive liberation front or
movement.

the unity i am talking about is not
unity for the sake of shouting that we
are united ... 1 mean unity of purpose
and action ... the purpose being our
liberation. we must have the purpose
of fighting the common enemy and
even more ... to defeat the enemy. we
have nothing to lose but our chains.

we must learn from our mistakes
and those of our forefathers and rec-
tify them before it is too late. we
should also learn from other african

first and foremost i would like to
hear from mr algar who has

this company was given a green light
by south africa in 1970, four years
after the un general assembly
revoked south africa’s mandate to
rule namibia. was rossing ignorant
of un decree number 1 which clear-

according to a report published
in the republikein of march 6 1987,
interim government minister, an.
dreas shipanga, ‘sharply criticised’
and expressed his ‘disappointment’
about certain statementa the vicar
general of the roman catholic
church, father bernhard nor-
dkamp, had allegedly made during
an address given at a youth seminar,
which, again according to the report,
is said to have been organised by the
council of churches. the report
relates to what mr shipanga 1s alleg.
ed to have said during a meeting of

the national assembly on march 5

1987.

mr shipanga, according to the
report, bases his claim about what

the vicar general had said during

the youth seminar held at dobra, on

a letter by an unidentified “win-

~ dhoek student'’ which letter was
- published in the windhoek observer

of february 28, 1987. the “student”
alleges, inter alia, that father nor-

- dkamp had said that “law and order
are sin”. for the purposes of this

statement it is sufficient to state that
the letter contains further very
serious distortions and outright un-
truths. it represents nothing but a
very ill-considered attempt to amear
the roman catholic church and to
discredit the vicar general, whose
commitment to bringing about
justice with peace in a truly chris-

especially regarding the “beatings
and torture” by koevoet in northern

namibia.

churchleaders must be involved in
politics because they are true

they love their people and country, they

concern on these points instead of echo-
ing swapo's hoary ploy of pointing to

of diverting attention from them. all
thinking namibians know by now that
south africa - like any country - is
focuasing on the protection of its own
interests, not those of any namibian
party. the recent contreternps between
the administrator general and the

the fact that south africa's interesta

why that government formally aban.

namibian parties who do not enjoy the

of their self-determination and right
to independence, 1s the very aim and

after the constitution so drawn up by
the elected representatives, there
could be a further election forthe first
government of namibia in terms ofthe
agreed constitution that willineffect

for a namibian government

in the case of namibia. however.
there already exists an international
ayreement.on the inclusion of certain
specified constitutional principles and
fundamental human rights in the
future constitution of namibia and
also safeguards for the protection of
minorities in the form ofa provision for
proportional representation and for
the further details of the constitution
to be decided upon by at least a two
thirds majority

so itis clear that even here a com-
promise hus already been reached
between those who want a constitution
first and those who want an election
before a constitution

swapo hasconsistently stood by the
peace plan and the democratic elec:
tions provided for in it, whereas
minister kozonguiz:. minister
shipanga and others show no sign of
suggesting anv sort of country-wide
elections to legitimise their appoint

vou redefined democracy, minister
kozonguizi? if 30, please let the ‘in

and your government's planof action

denigrate swapo in their presence in
front of the namibian people the

refugees and one can imayine the

tates of the pretorta government, (2)

negotiation - tn the hope that the sa
government may modify its position
which would amount to capitulation:
(srindifference inthe hope thatother
countries, other powers, may take up

out, for it must be pursued with
ruthless determination to win and
it must be reinforced by a principl-
ed dedication to the cause. from
thier public pronouncements, ilseems
clear that the leaders of south west
africa are moving in the direction of
armed struggle”

ft appears that the honourable
minister has since 1966 accepted the
firstoption above viz “capitulation. ”

what basis do namibians have for
beheving that the interim government
willabide by whatever constitution it
might draw up, when itis responsible

election?

excuse of un partiality: we
acknowledge tn our booklet the fact of
un partiality, but we explain whys it
will not have any effect on the judge
ment of namibians ina 445 election
but why don't you acknowledge south
africa’s partiality? why not?

the honourable minister of justice
has often inthe past reiterated thatin
africa power comes from the barrel ot
agun, and we suspect that he and some
of his associates have accepted this
credo.

it seems futile to argue with the
minister about free and fair elections
ifinterested in elections at all.it will
have to be elections which he can be
guaranteed to win- and free and fair
elections are unlikely to lead to that
result

negotiation and reconciliation

i wish to air my disappointment
about the issue of permits to the
travelling public between rundu and
the caprivi.

fellow namibians, it hurts tosee the
travelling public suffering likethey do
inthe country of their birth. ever since
the introduction of the issue of permits
by the sadf eight years ago, it seems
that namibians are not much concern-
ed about it.

the permits in question is not a
statutory law ofthecountry butrather
an imaginary law introduced by the ar-
my to cause severe hardship to capri-
vians and the travelling public.

the army should immediately and
unconditionally do away with the issue
of permits, for if not, namibians will
be left with nooption than tochallenge
the validity of the permits in acourt of
law. members of the travelling public
are checked and their clothing left in
the dust road, after every 50km stretch
from bagani to kongola.

a poor caprivian motorist with his
family, was travelling from katima
mulilo to windhoek and at the
kongola army checkpoint was ordered
todrive 120km back to katima to have
his provision of fish written on the
socalled permit. he had torefill hiscar
with petrol for a second time although
the permit in question does not
stipulate the inclusion of provisions of
any kind. though you are in possession
of the permit, it does not offer you pro-
tection of any kind, because it is
stipulated that youtravel at yourown
risk. what is the use of carrying
something that does not give you any
protection? what is the use of iden-
tification cards issued to namibians
and residents? the behaviour of up-
ingtonians and people trom the cape
is intolerable and they must be sent
back to where they came from.

i appeal to all peaceloving church
organisations, progressive political
parties, and namibiansboth and
white, to stand up and apeak out
against the issue of permits between
rundu and caprivi. .

killing won't help namibians,
especially those swapol members in

it is our plea for those peace-loving
namibians to try and look at the
political struggle with some common
sense.

many people, especially members of
swapol, also known as koevoet, seem
to believe that physical violence will
change our views as namibians in this
country.

i and two comrades, living in the
katutura compound, were assaulted
by drunk membersof swapol on april
15(a wednesday) after midnight at the
rasta funk disco.

why do members of these forces at-
tack innocent namibians? were they
appointed to maintain law and order
or not?

are they trained in the right way? or
are they trained to hit and kick inno-
cent people? shouldn't they be helping
us against trespassers of the law?

it seems that many of those people
are cowardly rather than brave, and
this is why they attack innocent
civilians rather than delinquents.

whatever they do, apartheid will one
day be abolished and the racist, apar-
theid followers in our country, should
be given their own ‘homeland’ where
they can do their own things.

we are not against the different
forces, but we oppose their shocking
conduct towards citizens, and their
negative attitude towards the
maintenance of law and order.

they should remember that we are
all namibians, and all human beings,
and all creatures of god.

stead look for better strategies tofight

on anti-swapo

on june 9, i received anonymous
anti-swapo literature. i have learned
that the literature has ‘»een circulated
tomany people who are suspected ofbe-
ing members of swapo in the kavango.

what surprised me is that this
literature is the act of a coward, since
the documentation is not attributed or
named. the literature is full of mixed
texts extracted from various unknown
newspapers accompanied by a poor
rukwangali version. it is also full of
anti-nujoma statements such as ‘nu-
joma het geslaan’, and ‘vuishou 'n
akok’, to mention but a few.

some swapo executives in kavango
were warned about what they were do-
ing. there is also a page of pictures of
eight people, probably emanating from
the socalled parents committee, with
question marks. these eight people
are those they believe have been ex-
semted by the movement.

according to news reports around
25 000 people are benefiting from an
emergency feeding scheme. the
department of national health and
welfare, and private welfare organiza-
tions, like the red crogs are involved.
while having sympathy with
hungry people, and supporting the ef:
forts to help, we have to ask ourselves,
“why are these people starving”. the
following problems are contributing to
the problem viz:
a) population growth:
the annual population growth hovers
around three percent. fifty percentof
the population is 15 years or younger,
and therefore unproductive. between
© to 10 percent are retired and no
longer make a contribution. present-
ly only 20 percent ofthe population are
gainfully economically employed, and
of this group, one quarter works for the
state. the balance 20-25% are either
subsistence farmers or unemployed.
the population growth ou tstrips
food production, housing resources,
schooling, health services and job crea-
tion. as @ result the population
becomes poorer and poorer, and the
economically active group smaller in
proportion. it is always tempting in an
effort toredistribute wealth, to heavi-
ly tax this group. care must however
be taken not tokill the goose that lays
the golden eggs.
b) drought:
namibia isasemi-desert country and
droughts are part of life. the problem
arises when the odd few good rainfal]
years are taken asthe norm and no pro-
vision is made for the inevitable bad
years in nature's cycle.
c) farming methods:
farming methodsaresometimes very
destructive, especially in the com-
munal areas. there, no rotation graz-
ing is implemented and very little con-
trol is exercised over stock numbers.
traditionally the number of cattle ib
a symbol of wealth, irrespective of their
condition. owners are alsooften loathe
to sell their cattle, even in times of
drought, with resultant destruction of
grazing and death, as witnessed a few
years ago in kaokoveld. the result ig
the same as in the sahel region in

ranking south african government
ministers to namibia. one wonders
why they do this because it has no
meaning for namibians. isit possible
that south africa’s defence minister
could concern himself with the con-
stitutional council?

did they come here to talk about the
real situation in namibia, or did they
come to give instructions to their
pawns in the interim government? did
they come to re-inforce the curfew
restrictions? what is the purpose of
protecting a minority when they
disregard the wishes of the majority?

ing for independence, crving for self-
determination and implementation of

ty is detrimentally affected by the
socalled sa df and swatf. the latter
created illegally in our country.

lfeeltheir visit was a provocation to
the oppressed people of namibia, and
those who welcomed them here must
be people who have lost interest in
namibian affairs.

let sa leave namibia in peace; let
them give the namibians what they
want and forget about creating confu-
sion with an appointed, unrecognised
government which works under sa
control.

in his letter dated july 17, he made

the namibian that swapo wouldallow
whites to keep their farmsin namibia
and that they would use only some
uninhabited parts of namibia for
cooperative projects. are we tostick to
the namib desert and khomas
hochland with our ‘cooperative’ pro-
jects a la socialism? not at all.

the grand children of maharero,
mandume and witbooi are still wag-
ing the war against the racist south
african government to regain their
land. there must be noquestion about
it. our forebears gave their lives in
defence of our land and the present
generation is also sacrificing their
lives to regain the land from the white
oppressors. as long as our land re-
mains in the hands of the present
white monopoly farmers, there can be
and there will be no peace and stabili-
ty in namibia.

the questionofland isa very serious
matter which lies at the heart of our
struggle. the whites will continue to
control our economy ifthey retain the
land and our freedom will be in name
only ... something like the mpc is
claiming today. that will be a sham
freedom within poverty, white domina-
tion and exploitation of our wealth.
such independence is definitely not
worth fighting for.

we must fight for the land and all our
natural resources. i believe that thisis
the only solution for the black majori-
ty of namibians. the whites are still
controlling thefarms and the economy
in zimbabwe and those who fought
during the war are not satisfied at pre-
sent. the zimbabwean government is
trying to solve this problem which |
realise is a very difficult task at this
stage. this is why in the case of
namibia we must grab our in-
dependence in terms ofthe ownership
of land. we must show to have learned
the lessonsof african history. the land
belongs tothe people of africa and not
to those who call themselves ‘euro-
peans’ in namibia.

we cannot promise our sacred land
to the very same white farmers who
support the all-apartheid white na-
tional party of settlers in namibia. we
cannot give our land to those who, in
the may 6 elections this year, return-
ed p w botha to powerinordertopro-
tect their minority rights in namibia.
we cannot give our land to white
farmers who train koevoet and who
are themselves commando members
in the south african army.

since whites do not compromise on
any issue so far, why should we com-
promise our birthright? the masses of
our people shall take over the land
from the white monopoly capitalists
with or without compensation.

regarding the socalled owambo an-

nouncers in the services of the

..l] these announcers are blinded and
misled by south africa not to see the

they are used as instruments by sa to

deaths of freedom fighters in such a
way that it causes panic, wrath and
hatred amongthe peace-loving nami-
bians. they appear to keep silent on
the deaths in units such as sa df,
swatf and koevoet. furthermore
they urge people to believe the latter
suffer no casualties.
i: female announcersare guilty ofthe
same things.
i. most of these announcers have
become resident in the towns of
oshakati and ondangua and hardly
visit their places or origin. they are
fully disconnected from the nation. if
they are on a reporting mission, then
they are given an army escort.

their products such as liquor and

tion regarding education, health and
agriculture.

interest are never broadcast by this

ty by the security forces in namibia are
never broadcast.

tivities of sadf, swatf etango in

saluting ponhofi

i would like to air my views on the
socalled leaders of uukwanyamr’sre-
centcal for army reinforcement inthe
region.

in the first place, i would like to
salute my comrades, fellow students of
ponhofi secondary school, who called
upon the sadf to withdraw from the
region, in particular the ovambo ad.
ministration and many other victims
of the racist pretoria regime.

inthe second place i would like to in.
form messrs kwautima, dan and
nghihulifwa and their disciples inthe
region that we want freedom and not
an extension and intensification of up.
ppreesion and victimisation as is the
case in the north presently. if mr

kwautima genuinely wants freedom
and security then he should fight for
the implementation of resolution 435.

itseems thatthe menin question do
not know what resolution 435 is. they
simply believe that koevoet will bring
stability in the region.

if kwautima, nghihulifwa and their
followers cannot exist without the ar-
my and koevoet, then they should go
together with them, and leave nami-
brans in peace.

kwautima claimed over radio
owambo that even chief mandume
had soldiers. this may be, but man-
dume did not fight his fellow nami-
bians but fought the same colonialism
which we namibians are fighting
against today. how can kwautima
compare himself with a man like
mandume?

whatever kwautima does. he and
his followers will never win the people's
hearts and minds. students of ponhofi,
you must not be intimidated by these
people. you must not surrender your
attitude of resistance tothe sadf we
are al] with you and behind you.

we shall not be intimidated by south
african surrogates and their puppets.
the army and koevoet must pack up
and go.

lived far from their home and their

live in peace and tranquility and
should not be controlled by swapo’s
henchmen through intimidation and
victimisation. secondly, we were con-
vinced that the majority of those
workers were honest people who
desired to be employed and to earn
enough money to support their
families, but that they inevitably
became, directly or indirectly, involv-
ed in the conflict between criminals

in the wake of christmas and my
dealings with the namibian during
1987 i fee) myself competled to write
you this letter in my personal capaci-
ty in order toset the record straight on
the real meaning of the words peace
and goodwill.

after an in-depth study and research
on the reporting as presented by the
namibian during the past year | come
to the conclusion that no objectivity
was portrayed by your newspaper con-
earning the south west africa situa.
tion. instead, you tried to portray the
enemy, swapa including all tts wings
and associates as the “peace-seekers”
nowhere could i find a call to stop ac.
tions by these organisations which are
detrimental to our country and all its
inhabitants, such as boycotts,
sabotage, etc. no, you rather opted to
go for the “alternative view’ of
revolution.

let me give you only one example:
justabout every week some kind of ac-
trocity by the security forces was
reported. the security forces spelt 1ot
out clearly that no atrocities by
members of the security forces
would be tolerated. members who
are found guilty by a court of law will
be punished accordingly. however,
when swapo claimed responsibility for
the bomb blast at the gustav voigts
centre you reported it to be “a
demonstration of namibian people's
resolve to shake off the yoke of col-
onialism by all necessary means”. is
this promoting peace and goodwill?

swapo opted for the revolutionary
methods some 21 years ago and let us
be honest, they've lost face, both
militanly and politically although
you portray this organisation tobe the
“true liberatora” of this country, |
guarantee that freedom will be
something of the past if they should
take over the reins. howevar, that ia
hardly to be foreseen.

in you socalled “bumper edition’
dated december 18, 1987, to january
8, 1888, you predict another year of war
in your ’polstical perspective” column,
however, in the same breath you cal!
upon organisations and individuals
“to re-agsesa and come up with a con-
crete and effective plan of action to
break the chains in 1988 andreachthe
goal ofa free namibia’ thus, 1 accept
that you areatthesametime wishing
for peace and war. this isa contradic.
tion i'll never be able to understand

please keep in mind: swapo opted for
war. this is what they got. the securi-
ty forces were in being long before the
existence of swapo and if you look at
the aim of any defence force in the
world, you will notice that their duty
{s, amongst other, the safeguarding of
life, property and freedom, during

1988 the security forces will maintain
this aim!

may | wish you not a worldly “hap:

that you may also experience the love
of god towards mankind manifested

note: don't talk absolute rubbish,
commandant. you should know
better. an in-depth study and
research of the reporting in the
namibian, and frequent, virtual
weekly reports of security force
atrocities (on your own admission)
should be telling you something.

you would prefer, obviously, that
because the defence force has
stated that “no atrocities by
members of the security forces will
be tolerated”, that we should not
report them at all. 1s this what you
define as ‘objectivity’? while on
thesubject, perhaps youcouldtell
ue how many members of the
‘secunty’ forces appeared incourt
for atrocities, and how much, in
claims of compensation, has been
paid out by the military tomembers
of the civilian population in the
past year? we wonder whether you
even keep euch statistics.

interesting too, to see that you
classify swapo aa “the enemy”, and
amall wonder ‘security’ forces
target civiian members of the

are apparently fighting against the
people's liberation army of

centre was a ‘demonstration of the

in this regard is entirely without
factual basis.

the'security’ forces inthis coun-
try have not maintained the aimof

contrary, in fact.

and since you have the temerity
to talk about spreading the “love of

africa of a disaster, initiated by a ter-
rorist who obviously has no feeling for

disgust at commandant g r c
bester's childish, hopeless and self-
defeating comments which regularly
appear in this newspaper.

asa patriotic and oppreesed nami.
bian citizen, i really feel compelledto
respond to commandant bester’s
narrow-minded allegations against
the editor of this newspaper in par-
ticular and the entire oppressed but
fighting people of namibia under the
leadership of swapo.

i would like to make itcategorically
clear to commandant bester and his
masters in pretoria that swapo isthe
people of namibia and the people are
swapo. if south africa is trying to
destroy swapo, then they must be try-
ing to destroy the the suffering nami-
bian people. but the apartheid regime
will not succeed in destroving the peo
ple’s movement. the apartheid govern
ment has been trying to bring swapo
ta its knees for vears, but all therr ef-
forts were in vain

they have even tried to infiltrate the
organisation with spies, but none of
their dubious attempts have
succeeded.

commandant bester went on to ask
a foolsh and shortsighted question
“who opted for revolution?” the
answer issimple and clear: swapo. but
the next question to which he should
provide us witha proper answer is why
swapo resorted to armed liberation
struggle.

swapo secretary general, andimba
toivo ya toivo made the movement's
position clear in the sixties: “swapo
itself was a non-violent organisation.
but the south african government 13s
not truly interested in whether oppos!
tion is violent or non-violent. it does
not wish to hear any opposition to
apartheid”

furthermore, swapo president sam
nujoma. made clear the position of
swapo with regard to the people's
revolution against colonial oppression
and exploitation at the wcc con.
ference in lusaka last year. he said:

“on the question of violence, we make
no apology for the fact that afleracen-
tury of foreign oppression, genocidal
military campaigns and unbridled
economic exploitation, our movement
had decided totake up arms toconfront
colonial violence with armed self-
defence. it ig enshrined 1n our move-
mnent’s political programme that
swapo does not glorify war we wish
that nobody hadever forced ustohave
to fight a war of national liberation

but the reality of prolonged colonial
oppression in namibia being what it
is, we have been left wath no alter

nateve but to fight with armisin hand
for our liberty and right to self:
determination and independence to
those who would advise us not to fight
colonial oppression with armsin hand,
our answer is: ‘show us the available
non-violenl means to namibia's rn

dependence and we shall fellow”

the available peaceful means to
narnibian independence through un
resolution 435 has been deliberately
delayed by south africa for ten years
since 1981, the swapo president has
expressed hia genuine willingness to
sign a ceasefire with the south african
regime any where in the world but in
windhoek or pretoria. but what was
the response of south africa? they said
it was ‘premature’ to sign a ceasefire
with swapo.

on socalled ‘atrocities’ allegedly
committed by swapo against the
civilian population of this country, this
is wishful and baseless thinking on the
part of the people who have failed to

win the hearts and minds of the op-
pressed namibians.

if commandant bester claims that
swapo hag no support, then does he
think the over 3000 people whoattend
edthe recent swapo public meeting in
katutura were supporters of his
government?

commandant bester cannot tell us
about the wavs and means as to how
namibians should achieve freedom
and national independence, since the
whole history of the afrikaners in
south africa and nannbia ig written
in blood how did they achieve their
self-determination from britain?

ithink itishigh trme commandant
bester stop writing rubbish to the peo-
ple’s newspaper and should rather
send his misleading and counter.
productive letters to the koevoet
rkoerant

lappeal to the editor not to publish
any more of his letters. he has access
toall necessary meansof propaganda
and should leave the-editor of this
newspaper and dr a shejavali of the
council of churches in peace.

t would like to close with the words
of va toivo, whosaid that. “we believe
that south afmea haga choice either
to live at peace with us or tosubdue us
by force. if you choose to crush us and
impose your willon us then you noton-
ly betray your trust, but you will live
in security for only so long as your
power is greater than ours. no south
africa will live at peace in namibia, for
each will know that hissecurity is bas-
ed on force, and that without force he
will face rejection by the people of
namibia’.

swapo has nothing to do with the
bomb blast at oshakati.lam only one
of the many namibians who will
neither agree nor accept racist south
africa's malicious propaganda cam-
paign against swapo andthe people of
namibia. south africa through its
puppets and mass media continue to
deceive and mislead namibians as to
the true situation in our country.

[ feel deeply hurt at the loss of lives
ofinnocentciviliansat oshakat). itis
not the first time that the people of
namibia are intimidated, harrassed
and killed by the racists of pretoria.

who was responsible? there are
many instances as examples, 198]
bomb blast at oshakati post office. for-
tunately noinjuries; 1998 bomb blast
at okatana service station, killing two
americans and a local businessman,
mr nakambonde; 1985 bomb blast at
ondanywa post office, killing many
people including children: 1985 bomb
blast at the ongwediva training cen-
tre, fortunately nocasualties:; 1986 so-
meone tried to plant a bomb at mr
frans indongo’s continental super-
market, fortunately he wascaught red-
handed and felt very ashamed: 1986
security forces tried to plant a bomb for
cda president peter kalangula, but
this too failed.

further still, there are many, many
namibians who have either been kill-
edor whodisappeared,andiamciting
the following examples; mathias
ashipembe, david sheehama,
fillemon elifas, joseph dumeni and
many others. these are merely some
examples of atrocities committed by
south africa against the people of
namibia, and for which swapo gets the
blame.

many namibians do not have homes
or property any more, as these have
been destroyed by the racist’s casspirs.
swapo has never committed any such
actagainst the people of this country,
which we cannot say about south
africa. racist south africa is to be
blamed for numerous atrocities
against namibians, and i call upon the
international community to quickly
intervene. we, the people of namibia
will continue to call for your
withdrawal from our beloved land.
even if you rape, imprison, maim, kill
and destroy our property. we call upon
you, racist south africa, to uncondi-
tionally withdraw your forces from
namibia and to allow the implemen-
tation of un resolution 435, so that

peace and justice may come to our

what charisma?

as long as i live, i remain flab-
bergasted by the gravity of audacity,
courage and perseverance some people
are endowed with. these are the words
which slip into my mind whenever |
stop to muse over the kind of personaili-
ty of our bishop kleopas dumeni of
elcin.

to me the bishop orchestrates a
typical leader, who, given a chance
wasted by fortune-seekers and
hypocritical politicians in thiscountry,
will or can lead namibia into blossom-
ing tomorrows.

the bishop's charisma goes beyond
spiritual confines. it isto me always a
blessing to listen to his sermons and
how i wish, always, he could be allot-
ted the presidency.

the bishop displayed metaphysical
courage and boldness at the recent
mass funeral of victimsof the oshakati
bank bomb massacre. in the face of a
gruesome and satanic horror which
struck numb the people of the north,
where innocent young lives, including
that of his own daughter, were put to
waste, he said his say and he said it
right and in a calm and unshaken
voice.

one really wonders atthe charisma
this man of god haa, for, even if death
struck his family a cataclyamic blow,
almost thrice in a row, he goes forth to
console his parishioners, when he
should himeelf sit and be consoled.

is it possible to talk about church and
politics at the same time? do the two
have anything in common? can the
church mix with politica? such ques-
tions and more similar questions are
struggled with in the context of
namibia in particular. such questions
are both theological and political. for-
tunately, theological and political
questions are asked by human beings
who are involved either in the church
and/or politics in one way or another.

my aim here is to open up a
theolagical and political debate for
concerned people in a situation of apar-
theid, colonialism, racism, exploita-
tion and draconian lawssuch as those
of namibia. i am stating only
preliminary remarks, sparing the rest
for contemplated responses.

the truth of the matter is that the
church cannot claim its existence
without people likewise politics can.
not be without people. it is the people
whoconstitute the church. it is the peo-
ple who politicise. the basic concern of
the church is wider and broader than
ity numerical membership. it is within
the framework of the church's pro-
pheticcall and public responsibility to
aspire for peace, justice, freedom,
respect of human rights and dignity to

is not serving angels, but human be-

allow me toair my opinion that we
the namibians, are guilty of colonising
ourselves, especially in the far north
of namibia.

students who pass matric with good
symbols are unable to find jobs. often
only those from rich families are con-
sidered, while those from poor families
are turned down. employers
sometimes only give jobs to those well-
known names from rich families.

it happens in the hospitals as well.
on many occasions only those who are
well known inthe hospital circles can
be immediately hospitalised ifthey are
ill or sick, while many poor people
stand for a long time before they get
treated.

i wishtocall for anendtothis sort of
discrimination. namibians should do

ment equality among themselves in

ner of colonising your own people.

the people think that the person the

south africa's own instrument.

from my point of view this was an at-
tempt to cause hatred among the peo-

divide us in order to facilitate their il-

i feel this action was intended to
smear the name of swapo and at the

kalangula who calls for the
withdrawal of the south african

we note the letter from professor a
heywood, published in your
newspaper on may 20, 1988, in which
she differs with certain statements
made in an advertisement which was
placed by npp 435 in the windhoek
observer. we would like to respond to
the three major points which she has
raised in her letter:
1) on the question of whether or not
resolution 435 provides for elections
under joint south african and united
nations (un) supervision: prof
heywood is quite correct in stating
that ‘‘resolution 435 and the
documents surrounding it are reflec-
tions of historical reality”. your cor-
respondent correctly points out that
resolution 385 (which preceded
resolution 435 by tlwo-and-a-half
years) declares that free elections be
held under supervision and control of
the un. however, in order to give effect
to resolution 385, the western five
negotiated a settlement plan for
namibia with south africa and
swapo, which culminated in the
western proposal for settlement
(security council document 5/126386).

this western proposal was
thereafter ratified by the united na-
tions security council (unsc) in its
resolution 435 (1978) and as such
forms part of the resolution.

in resolution 431 of july 27, 1978,
the security council took note of the
western proposals, and requested the
secretary-general to submit a report
containing his recommendations tor
the implementation of the western
proposals. thus the western proposals
were accepted by the unsc in resolu-
tion 431. in security council docu-
ment s/12827 of august 29, 1978, the
secretary-general made recommen-

_ dations, as requested in res 431; later,
in an explanatory statement
(8/12869) of september 28, 1978, he ad-
dressed and explained certain con-
cerns raised during consultations with
all the parties involyed. both of these
documents were approved in res 435
of september 29, 1978, and the
western proposals were approved and
ratified as such by res 435 (1978).

costs of 435

what many namibians have warned
against for many years has now come
to pass. as soon as the south african
government tells us of ‘agreement’
with regard toimplementation of 435,
we are informed that it will cost
billionsandthe un must now look for
the money.

for years, all un resolutions aimed
at preserving the natural wealth of our
country, have been ignored by south
africa and all those nations exploiting
our natural resources. south african
occupation of namibia costs millions
aday but no money is available for the
implementation of the peace plan.
salaries of south africa’s proxies in
namibia have been increased time and
again and for that, money was

available. and in all this, namibians
had no say, they only paid taxes.

while we are not overexcited at thie
point that the agenda for implementa-
tion will follow the time schedule that
was indicated by the sa foreign
minuater, the time has come for nam.
bians to state their position with
regard to who will foot the bill surely
we cannot accept that our country has
become a poor and underdeveloped and
dependent country all of a sudden
therefore we would like to make some
suggestions to the un secretary
general who will now be presented

reliant through the ages, we would not
hke to become international beygars
at this point and would lhke to con
tribute towards the costs of implemen
tation of unscr 435

ponder

namibia still has some resources
therefore we propose that an indepen.
dent commission be established im
mediately with complete insight into
all transactions involving monies leav-
ing this country, with immediate
effect,
_ that all export of namibian natural
resources be monitored by the un and
all resources accruing therefore, be put
in a fund towards paying for
implementation;
= that with immediate effect, all
monies collected through sales tax be
paid into the abovementioned fund;
c that the exhorbitant salaries paid
to sa proxies in namibia be im-
mediately stopped and that money be

pat in the abovementioned
all know that the ag andthe ba
civil service runs namibla and they
should receive salaries from the ool-
onial] power according to international
practice;
o thatal) these companies which, ac-
cording to the thirion report, have
been sending out natural resources il-
legally, or have paid leas taxes than
they should have, be compelled to pay
the said amounts in the implementa.
tion fund;
j that all taxes paid by namibiansin
order to fund second tier authorities,
be channelled into the said fund.

since the people of this country have
never hed a say in whathappenstothe
funds collected through the means
above, they should do eo now. the six
points mentioned above are only
pointers. we realise there should be
some control and therefore suggest
that all those parties which have been
in favour of the implementation of 435
now form a watchdog committee and
take this issue up immediately. all
namibians know that thesaid parties
are constituent members of the /ai-

delaying tactics by the racist regime of
pretoria. i decided not to withdraw my
message to you because of rumours of

peace.

my dear namibiana, do you know
that there are eeven chief human
wanta in life? theee are: air to breathe;
water to drink and for domestic pur-
poses adequate, wholesome and
nroriehing food; land on which to build
our houses; sufficient clothing to keep
us warm and enable us to conform with
accepted standards of decency; fire or
fuel to enable us to cook our food: and
a shelter to protect us from the sun,
wind and rain

if the namibian nation is deprived
of these needs by a certain greedy
group of people, that greedy grouperrs
against god's will and against the
whole of humanity. so. no government
(nobody) has right to keep away these
natural wants from any individual
because the youth of today 18 the future
generation, i think itis of paramount
importance for the youth of namibia
to watch crntically and see if there is
any violation of these wants. if there
18 @ violation, what is the necessary
tesistance our youth need to render? if
our air is being polluted. i feel itisthe
responsibility of our youth to take an
active stand in order to protest that
evil iffew people have sufficient food
and water while many people have not,
aganitremainsthenght ofour youth
to analyse the root cause of auch evil
namibia in a “spacious” country as
everybody says, but the freedom toown
a piece af land is deliberately threaten.
ed by the high price of buying 3t
becaune the land of namibiais not yet
in the hands of the owners (nami
bians). the colonisers are making big
money frum explouing us in order to
tive a proper life, we need the land and
this remains the yreatest task of the
youth of namibia to struggle and
regainour land we, therefore, cannot
be a nation if we have no land

history can prove that the struggle
in namibia isover the landinthe first
placeandallother things likehuman
rights etc come xecond the struggle
waged by our political forefathers auch
ax witboo!, mandume, mahareroand
many others, was the struggle for our
right to keep the land. they tried to
their very best efforts to resist thecol
onisers take-over ofthe land anyway,
they lost because they were not united.
but they are not defeated for we ure
here to continue their resistance -on-
ty fareunited naturally, politically
andeconomically, namibia is cur land
and we want it back now.

denr comrades and friends, freedom
is what we desire -itisour destination
of course, freedom or independence
has become an urgent want. in life,
every human being hasatask tofulfil
we are the childrenofthe progressive
parents and they did their best in all
thetr efforts to bring about the in-
dependence of uur land. yea, it becomes
now the role ofthe namibian youth to
fulfil the dreams and aims of our
forefathers. those dreams are very im-

t. as the late martin luther
king said: “i have a dream...” and
the group, the young rescals said in
their song: “all the world over, it's so
cany to 200 - people everywhere just to

government leaders are calling you
that name because they feel the

sytem. only you can bring about
nuine freedom and their down-fall.
because of money they blindly failled
lo see that every pereon(our youth too)
regardiess of his station in life, hasa
dignity and importance far greater
than a lower animal. it remains your
full duty to reniat anything that may
keep you away from the struggle for in-
dependence. anything like economic
conscription, corruptive education.
“minds and hearts” winning program:
mee, etc.

my beloved youth of namibia, do you
agree with me that the strugglo is over
the land in the first place? the im-
perialist governments are not in-
terested in namibis because love
the namibians they certainly donot
love us but they just fell deeply in love
with the land namibia because she 1s
very rich. now they are raping our
motherland. america, britain, west
germany and many other european
countries are more interested in
mineral resources our land produces
and not inthe namibian people.

the south african soldiers and police
killed many namibians because of the
land not because namibianscommit-
ted any sin tho youth must be aware
of this fact that they must struggle, not
for a sce of bread or a loafofbread, but
for the whole bakehouse. we muat free
the whole land of namibia all evil
powers of colonialism and neo-
colonialism must be resisted. col-
onialism is violance - oppression is
violence neo-colonialism isbribery or
betrayal which is also violence ands

these must be resisted. to revolt

does not mean cuy.mitting violence as
oppressors tendj.o put it. we revolt

namubiana, stand upaod fight for your
rights - your country is your rights

letusbe vigilant and not be confus
ed by what i call ‘rumours of peace”
and stop the genuine process of the
struggle for freedom some of us may
say: let us stop a bit and see what will
happen. | say no, because to stop “a bit”
while there is nothing really achieved
is hike putting a horse behind the cart.
let uscontinue the struggle untilall
uur dreamsand visions become a reali-

thisstruggle needs a young person's
prayer, mind, brain, energy. blood, tear

allow me tocomment on the letter
which appeared in the namibian of
august 05, under the heading
“pallacious’ written by v t kavari.

i've been present al the nanso con:
yrcsses since 1986¢ second congress) up
to this year with the fourth congress.
where i've experienced a spirit of
brotherhood.

what i have observed is that after &
speaker has delivered a speech, oppor:
tunity was given to the house for
discussion, questions, correction, ad.
dition, clarification, comment, etc.

i believe this was done so that with
the departure of the congress no com:
rades could go to their respective
places with unsolved problems as it ap
pears to be in your case.

i'm just wondering whether you
never got the opportunity to air your
viewsand to gopersonally tothe nec
members, instead of doing it in the
newspapers and to create a tasteless
spirit among the students, which 1s
totally unnecessafy.

if you were at the congress you will
remember that comrade shihwamen!
was the last person to clarify on this
issue. |

he explained that people have to
make the difference between 4 pro
gressive parly and a liberation move-
ment. he went on saying that pro-
gressive parties are mostly concerned
with ethnic issues, while swapo which
‘sa liberation movement, is aimed at
liberating all the peace loving people
in namibia irrespective of their col-
ours, ethnic groups, etc.

this is a fact that we, in namibia
have to accept that swapo is the only,
only armed movement that isfighting
(uniess, a8 shinwameni said, “there is
another armed movement that 1s
hiding underground’)

whatcomrade steve saidat the con-
gress on this issue was positive and i,
with the majority accepted it, although
you differed as you said, in your letter.
of course, minorities always differ!
that we have learned from history in
this country.

lastly, let the truth not hurt ua,
please!

general is adding to the confusion by
repeating issues that were long since
dealt with. are his pronouncements
aimed at shipwrecking the present

of south africa’s unwilling participa-

the question of the socalled ‘un par:
tiality’ was addressed to the satisfac.
tion of the sa government from 1978
to 1982. south africa wae satisfied to
such an extent that at one point the sa
minister of foreign affairs went on

the only obstacle to the implementa.
tion of resolution 435.

it is however, important to state that
itis not only the un that must be im.

pected from the office of the ad.
ministrator general. both the special
representative ofthe un's secretary
general and the sa representative -1n

re is another sfde tothe story of j
the socalled “ten years of peace in east
caprivi’ (the windhoek advertiser,
august 26). it has not had ten years of
peace as brigadier gert nel suggests:
it has been ten years of humiliation
and intimidation.

iregard this report as an attempt to
invalidate the very successful swapo
rally held in the region on august 20,

as wellastodiscredit capriviansin the
eyes of fellow namibians. brigadier
nel’s tong report on the socalled ‘peace’
is mere propaganda.

leaders have been intimidated and
harassed by the sadf and its counter-
part, swapol, formerly sap. the socall-
ed ‘leaders’, as claimed by brigadier
nel, are instruments used to further
the prevailing status quo. the tradi-
tional leaders are merely the
equivalents of the katjiuonguas and
matyplas of namibia.

as regards what brigadier nel calls
‘cooperation’ between the army and
civilians, i have the following to say:

* intense psychological war is at work
in the region; 7

* the people do not admire the sadf
or swatf, because it is not their army,
but south africa's, the civilians may
‘cooperate with the army because they
need to survive; but itis not out of their
own will. their fear is legitimate.

the bitter irony behind the creation
of 701 battalion is that most young
men have joined the army as a last
resort. the rate of unemployment in
caprivi is so high that people are left [
with two major options: to join the ar-
my, undesirable as that is, or become
a teacher. |

the sadf and swapol have repress-
ed any sign of protest so that may give
an illusion of ‘peace’ in the region.

regarding enok/fndc, this com-
pany may be credited with
monopolistic and exploitative prac-
tices in the region. it is notorious for
paying low wages, and they are cer-
tainly not contributing to any develop-
ment worth mentioning

the swabc is nothing other thana
mouthpiece of the interim government
and ita masters in pretoria: it is also
used to disseminate the kind of pro-
paganda which brigadier nel

we face an enemy that is deep-

determined not to yield. our march to

within and beyond our borders the pro-

spects of victory grows bright.
the first condition for victory 1s
black unity. every effort to divide

blacks must be vigorously repulsed.
our people must be united into a
single, massive and solid wall of
resistance of united mass action. this
isnot the time for the luxury of disun)-
ty, we must close ranks at all levels, and
differences must be submerged to the
achievement ofa single goal which is
the complete overthrow of apartheid
and racist domination.

the revulsion of the world against
apartheid is growing.. the world ison
our side, the oau, the un andthe anti.
apartheid movement continue to put
pressure on the racist and colonial
rulers of our country. every effort to
isolate south africa adds strength to
our stuggle. at all levels much has
been achieved and much remains to be
done, but victory is certain.

we must look beneath the veil of con.
gstitutional formulas and deceptive
phrases to see the face of apartheid. the
rattling of gunfire and the rumbling of
hippo armoured vehicles

south africa, angola, m{zambique,
namibia, botswana, zambia, lesotho
still have to shed blood to defeat the last
bastion of oppression and blistering in-
ferno of racial hatred.

in the name of all strugglers, de.

bleeding heart is with the hereaved

mounted up with wings like an eagle
because they know that the end of op-
pression is at hand, our moment has
come, we shall be free and peace shall
reign.

united as before. whathappened at the
congress was mere recognition and
acknowledgement of the reality that
swapo is the leader of the liberation
movement, let alone being the only
liberation movement. kavari, in fact
should show cause why nanso must
not acknowledge swapo leadership of
the national liberation struggle. i feel
strongly thattoaccept the unavoidable
reality that swapo leads the nation
liberation struggle does not make us
politically affiliated to swapo.

what is surprising for kavari's let-
ter and all others who seem to be con-
cerned with nanso’s socalled pro-
swapo stand, isthat noneofthem men-
tioned the current crisis in education.
an impression is given that nanso’s
recognition that swapo leads the
liberation struggle is more evil and
criminal than the current crisis in
education. meetings after meetings
are called and proposed not to address
the crisis, but nanso. nanso now has
become the crisis. kavari talks of
another national student movement
as a possibility, simply because nan-
so has recognized swapo leadership of
our struggle. ifnanso had recognized
or named the hnp as a progressive
party, than one would understand and
conceptualize the cry of kavari et al.
if nanso had failed to address the cur-
rent crisis properly and kavari et al
talk of another student movement
which shall address the crisis in a bet-
ter way, one would understand their
cry. but thecry issimply because nan-
so says swapo leads our nation at war
with sa colonizers. swapo, the pro-
greasive movement, the organizer of
victories of our people in their heroic
anti-colonial and anti-imperialist
struggle, has suddenly become the
crisis now in which energies must be
expended. the colonizera are now

created crisis ia not ad eased, then.

ing against the regime.
according tothe current talks
south africa and america introdaced
new issues in the matter and are try-
ing their best to switch the burden of
talks to the opposite parties - will
angola accept all the sa. and
american demands? if yes, what will
happen to angola next?
we rejected the connection of cubans
to the independence of namibia and

wore and are still demanding the

withdrawal of the s.a. troops and ita il-
legal regime from namibia, but not
one of either parties (south africa or
america) is willing to listen to us as
they are in favour of war. south africa
staysin walvis bay even after unscr
435 is implemented - what then?

we are intimidated by the sa.
regime with its apartheid laws and
military atrocities. it is preaching its
“goodness” to win the hearts and
minds of the people, but we suffered for
a long time under its colonial regime.
it is still continuing to minimize our
political rights - how will we continue
with talks?

cubans were willing to help angola
from the intimidation we expenencing
here and their presence in angola is
legal. as long as the intimidation to
the namibian people continues
angola cannot be saved.

those who are threatened by the
presence of cubans in angola are the
“terreblanche group’ of the south
african regime, who want to exploit
the angolan people and its allies. once
the cubans withdraw from angola the
‘“terreblanche speech” in the past few
days will be manifested practically.

the namibian people welcome the
cubans, because they are comrades -
they don't kill, but save. we have ex-
perienced sa (not cuban) atrocities;
and the angolans too.

to all who live in it, black and white.

the main demands are: the people
shall govern; all national groups have
equal rights and should unite; the land
shall be shared among those who work
for it; all shall be equal before the law;
all shall enjoy equal human rights;
there shall be work and security; the
doors of learning and culture shall be
opened; there shall be houses, securi-
ty and comfort; there shall be peace
and friendship. justice shall be the key
of all activities.

finally, let all who love the people
and their country now say, as we say
here: the freedom we will fight for, side
by side, throughout our lives, until we
have won our final liberty.

independence.

brains and liberate namibia. we want
the maintenance of human nghts,

we want lo do away with the sys-

can never be found again.

it is clear that ‘there was never a
good war or a bad peace’, yet it is
better to die on one's feet than live on
one's kneews.

we all know that apartheid is like
aids in namibia: our people have
died and are dying because of this
disease.

i hope that in the course of 1989 we |
can achieve our independence, shake
off colonialism, and bring about a
swapo government under sam
nujoma. i want mr nujoma to gov-
erm the whole of namibia including |
walvis bay. without the inclusion |
of walvis bay, namibia cannot be
independent.

teall on those namibians who

have been collaborating, to drop the
south african government and its
police forces and join the national
movement, swapo.

we must give fl support to swapo,
because swapo is the people of

no to homelands

the tnbalists who are trying to
divide this country into homelands
must be made to remember that our
nation cannot tolerate such divisions
in namibia. the land is one, and the

e are one. our nation must stand
firm in unity to fight against all forms
of divisions and homclands in the

country. things like the socalled
republic of rehoboth and caprivi
cannot be tolerated in the would-be
independent namibia.

_ those who are involved in organi-
sing such things must repentand give
up such reactionary ideas immedi-
ately. this country is one, from the
angolan border to the orange river,
and from the zambian border to the
aduantic ocean.

we find it disturbing that we still
have brainwashed afncan (namib-
ian) intellectuals who believe in
homelands and tibalism when we
have our heroes who have died for
the freedom of namibia as a whole.
] just wonder from which books these
people have gathered such mislcad-
ing information.

these people should know that itis
utterly irresponsible and a marked
betrayal of those who died fighting
for the independence of namibia as
well as the masses in this county.
those people should also know that
their actions are a sign of mental
subjugation, and what j would call
the disease, requires an antidote.
luckily, unlike aids, an anudote is
available. people involved in declar-
ing homelands in namibia must take
the undistorted history books and
read. perhaps this will make they
realise that they owe apologies to
faithful namibians.

i appeal to our brothers and sisters
in rehoboth and c aprivi not to sup-
port the people trying to lead them
into total nco-colonialism. all na-
mibians must have the freedom to
live where they want to; and not be
confined to certain regions.

swapo has been fighting to rid use
of the colonial yoke of south africa
and the movement accepts all patri-
otic namibians who want to be free.
swapo condemns tnbalism, region-
alism, sexism, racism and above all,
colonialism. the people of namibia
should be vigilant because the pup-
pets trying lo umpose homelands upon
them are creating civil war condi-
tions so that there is no peace ina free
namibia. our enemies are encourag-

160 cases were reported, of which
94 were brought to wial, in 1987

delaying tactic

allow me a space in the
peop!’s paper to query the irre-
~ sponsible activities of the supec-
powers, mainly the united states.

first of all they linked the
namibian peace process to the
withdrawal of cuban woops from
angola; now they want to link the
number of untag troops and offi-
cials with the negotiations. the
clarify the second point, | wish lo
state that the americans are the
ones who have the money; they
are the ones who have to pay for
the implementation of resolu-
tion 435.

now the us have another cx-
cuse: they say that they can only
afford r100 million or the equiva-
lent in dollars. this means that
the untag component has to be
reduced. if they have to pay the
full amount (for untag) then they
will demand that the angolan
governmem negotiate with units.
george bush claimed to have
brought poace to africa (with his
predecessor, reagan), 60 what is
going on?

how can 3000 (untag) troops
monitor over 60 000 (sovth afri-

pan) ? namibia's

be linked to the
of unita in the

angolan government? it appears

|
|
|

to me that the americans want.

war. they are the ones continu-
ing with their cia to support unita.
they are the ones who declared
the anc a terrorist movement;
they are the ones which attacked
the mig 23’s of libya; they are
the ones who don’t want the pal-
estinians to negotiate with the
israclis.

if they want to reduce the number
of untag troops, then they must

change resolution 435, because: —

resolution 435 says that 7500
untag troops will arrive in’ na-
mibia to supervise the elections;
resolution 435 does not stipulate
that the angolan government must
negotiate with unita; and in reso-
lution 435 there is no such thing
that untag troops must be com-
bined with the koevoet or the
police.

if they wantto contradict reso-
lution 435, then they must refor-
mulate it.

‘a sensitive nerve

indeed mr shipanga's ‘new year's
message’ touched a sensitive nerve
in me, especially with the untruths
and political dishonesty that ‘mes-
sage’ displayed.

in his article (27/01/89) mr shipanga
implies that because father wolfe
had said that ‘‘reconciliation of the
namibian people as a whole is needed
before we can become one namibia
one nation’’, then anybody who uses
the word ‘reconciliation’ on televi-
sion must go unchecked. mr shipanga,
reconciliation is not merely an event
- it is a process in which not only
what we say, but also what we do,
will determine the essence of our
determination.
~ so do not think that people will
believe your sincenty because you
use the words ‘peace’ and ‘reconcili-
ation’, even more so when your frame
of reference is artificial: (that your
tgnu protected the rights of na-
mibians during the past. three-and-a-
half years).

| maintain, mr shipanga, that your
cabinet sided with the south afncan
‘government in trying to stop duc
legal process, and i add that all this
was done at the expense of the tax-
payers, please say this is not true, and
tell the namibian people what posi-

reply to shipanga

this letter follows one by mr
vezera kandetu (the namibian
jamuary 14 1989) and to the reply by
mr andreas shipanga. i was going to
stat my mouth al this ume, and merely
hope that the future would bring me
and fellow namibians the best.

when shipanga joined the tgnu
he knew very well that they would be
tesponsible to the government of
south africa, and he chose to fight
for freedom, liberty and self-deter-
mination with the south african
government, with botha ‘leading the
revolution’ and the administrator
general es the man in charge of the
socalled ‘defenders’ of the nghts of
nanubians.

what does shipanga mean when
he says ‘it is just this sort of hubns
which has hampered the struggle for
truc liberation in namibia forsolong
and encouraged the armchair revolu-
lionaries to waste their words and
deeds on irtelevancies’.

to tell the truth, shipanga is one of
those who hampered the struggle for
true liberation if he remembers what
he did in 1978: he divided the froe-
doen fighters. and the description in
question fis him very well. lei me
say, he has been an annchair revolu-

tionary who hes been wasting his
words and deeds, by way of
tb namiblen people along nie
eeeets, th potio of he and his

colleagues made the south african
government realise that they could
not enforce its rule through namib-
ian intermediaries, and so they went
to the negotiating table.

the tgnu never had the power to
decide, and the south afncan gov-
emment got what it wanted from the
interim government.

swapo would like united people as
itis their mmouo to unite the namibian
people. but how can it succeed in
uniting the people if there are those
hike yourself who are always divid-
ing the nation. swapo will unite and
join hands with fellow namibians in
order to build up the nation you dis-
appointed, and the beloved land you
betrayed.

on the question of your call on
swapo to release the detainces it is
holding, that is none of your busi-
ness. after all, some of these things
are already provided for in accor-
dance with unscr 435 (1978) and
629 (1989), and all dates and events
are based upon the annex to the
settlement proposal s/12636 of apni
10 1978, just in case the south afri-
can government hasn't bnefed you.

why didn’t the intenm govern-
ment repeal laws such as ag 26:
many namibians have been detained
without trial, and the interim govern-
ment did not question this.

there are no atrocities in swapo
camps; and it was you who started
organising brother to stand against
brother, and sister against sister.

us rather have the facts re the dta’

guiding us to peace and stability in
order to take our nghtful place in the
world. please, i ask this of you and
the dta for the well-being of the

make the nght decision.

mr mudge, if it pleases you, i still
have questions to ask, bocause i want

Peace.19890407_page_1.txt,Oshakati Tsumeb Windhoek,"upset with untag

i wish to express my heartfelt
sadness at the irresponsible attitude
of untag in namibia from april 1.

i am disappointed in untag in
general and mr martti ahtisaari, for
their unwillingness to perform their
duties as expected of them by the
namibian people.

on april 1, a peaceful march of
the namibian workers under leader-
ship of nunw was forcefully stopped
by colonial, heavily armed police in
the absence of untag police who are

supposed to accompany them. thanks
lo the disciplined actions of the
workers themselves, injuries and
bloodshed was avoided since the
colonial police were under strict
command to act against the 15 0(xk)-
strong crowd if they proceeded with
the march to hand over a petition
protesting privatisation of public
property to mr louis pienaar, the
administrator general.

after the well-attended swapo rally
in windhock on april 1, swapo
ricmbers and supporters on their
way back north were shot al by two
white vigilantes. seven people were
injured, two senously. when a local
pastor went to report the incident to
untag personnel in tsumeb, he found
the officer in an inebnated.

the most buming issue, which
forced me to write this ictter, was
when civilians when to untag per-
sonnel in oshakati to repon heavy
fighting between plan and the colo-
nial army, the two malaysian mem-
bers of untag took no notice and
went on rcading their novels. some
of them were seen sipping wine with
south afncan soldiers at ondangue
and oshakau. |] am wondering whether
uiese intemational peacemakers are
really serious about what they are
doing in namibia. i am also sur.

_ prised that certain countries agree to
— contribute soldiers when they want
assurances of their safety.

} would also like toexpress myself

— on the decision by mr ahtisaari to
allow the notorious 10) and 202
battalions to be reactivated in order
to fight swapo. mr ahtisuani's mis.
s10n was to make peace but instead
he ugreed to the demands of the co-
lonial govemmor to allow the same
broupa to go ahead and continue
doing what they have done for ycars,

mr ahtisaan, through his actions,
has lost the respect and sopularity he
has enjoyed since 1074

i call upon all progressive farces
inside namibia ww take united and
dechiive action. we should always
remember the inspiring words of
swapo prosident, sam nujoma, who
sald ‘‘we the namibians, aro ow
own liberators'’.

please allow meto air my views
rogarding the position of mr martti
ahtisaari in the current situation in
our country:

sir, we are very perplexed by your
attitude tow ards our people under the
leadership of swapo.

it is amazing that, as un special
representative, who has come to
namibia to make sure that the inter-
national procedures leading to inde-
pendence, are carried out with jus-
tice and without partiality to any
party, you have given the order to the
troops of south africa to hunt down
forces who in fact were in the country
prior to the ceasefire.

this, to us who are yearning for
our freedom, clearly demonstrates
that you have taken apanial decision ‘|’
in favour of our colonisers. [tis a pity
that instead of bringing abwut peace,
you are encouraging the forces of the
racist’ government to eliminate
namibians.

swapo 1s a well-disciplincd move-
ment and would not defy the guide-
lines and regulations set up and agreed
to conceming our transition to inde-
pendence.

insteac of deploying untag
peacekeeping forces to the area of
conflict to separate the warring sides,
you decided in favour of the one side.
swapo forces then had no alternative
but to defend themselves against those
who started hunting down our com-
batants.

sir, if justice were to be done, you
would have acted impartially to
solvethe conflict. the government
in pretoria may have planned these
acts of violation in advance, to jeopar-
dise the peace process. they knew
long ago that anumber of plan forces
were based inside namibia. they
attacked our fighters on the day
implementation of the peace plan
started, and them put the blame on
our forces as the violators of the
peace process.

then most of the world, including
margaret thatcher, started blaming
swapo; they have most of the media
at their disposal. how can you decide
to assist the racist forces to expel

‘these bona fide sons of namibia from
their own country? angola is not

gave their lives

as one of the greatest fans of
your newspaper, allow me to air my
views conceming the recent clash
between swapo combatants and south
afncan security forces.

first of all, i take my hat off to
those freedom fighters who gave their
lives for us to be free. (not only
them, but for south african security
forces who didn’t know what they
were doing, may god forgive them).
when i think of those who died, my
blood mins cold. freedom was so
near and yet so far for them.

secondly, the members of the un
who were in favour of the reduction
of untag from 7500 t0 4650, should
now bow their heads in shame. what
&@ great mistake it was.

according to eyewitnesses, the
security forces fired against the
combatants first. andi believe them.
one may ask why? because i cannot
believe someone, who, for 70 years,
has made me a subject of the evil
system called apertheid.
pepe pre swapo. why?

blamed because
fought beck in self-defence? orie
because the us end its allics call

swapo a ‘terrorist’ organisation?
swapo is a liberation movement and
we are proud of it. according to
international law and the un char-
ter, we have the right to resist south
afican occupation.

the untag forces were supposed
to secure peace. where were they?
the botha’s are making fools of them.
the un is now experiencing what we
have experienced for many years.

the swapo combatants were re-
grouping to be confined to bases
when the security forces fired on
them. who gave that instruction?
botha or ahtisaari?

last but not least: untag gives the
green light to south africa to re-
deploy koevoet and 101 battalion to
assist them in their peacekeeping task.
will a child's heart ever forget who
killed his mother? will amother ever
forget who raped her ten-year-old
daughter? some may forgive, but
they will never forget.

we will continue to resist our
occupation: europe tasted nazi oc-
cupation and opposed it. we have the
right to do the same.

mudge and kaura

. thedta chairman dirk mudge,
saust clean his pwn house before he
| -ooks at those of others. we see dta

- for reconciliation. we notice that the
dta has chosen to fight against swapo
rather than south africa, which has
occupied the country formany years.

mudge has also been making ac-
cusations about atrocities in swapo
settlements, something he has no
evidence of. yet he and his sapport-
ets appear to have koevoet at their
disposal, who are the culprits as far
as atrocities in namibia are con-
cerned. mudge and kaura are not
happy to see a namibian nation
marching to freedom. they appear to
be perpetrating tribalism and divi-
sion among the people of this coun-

a few weeks ago k aura was inter-
viewed on the bbc where he claimed
that swapo leaders were provoking
his supporters and he warned about
‘fights’ which may erupt in katu-
tura. he also wamed swapo leaders
that their safety may be jeopardised
if such ‘fights’ break out.

the anti-swapo propaganda being
carried out by the dta is the reverse
of the wuth. we have evidence that
the dta is doing the very things they
accuse swapo of.

dirk mudge and kaura must real-
ise that in swapo, they are dealing
with amovement whichis politically
mature. swapo is not interested in
bringing namibians into conflict or
the county into neo-colonialism, as
the dta is doing.

mudge and kaura must control
their supporters not to provoke peace-
ful swapo supporters any longer.
swapo supporters do not interfere
with the affairs of other groups. let
us campaign peacefully for the elec-
tions without intimidating anyone.
mudge and kaura must know what
the consequences of civil war is - that
is, if they have ready history. we in
namibia do not want such a situation
here. our people have suffered for
too long and they need peace and
freedom, which swapo has and still
stands for.

why do they have to monitor the

will swapo fighters do the same
when they withdraw? what is the

peace miles away

the tong yearned-for namibian
after more than 70
years of south african rule, is clearly
visible. but prospects toward a ljast-
ing peace m a future independent
namibia, and the entire region of
southern africa, is still miles away.
there are two major areas of concem
- the status of walvis bay and the
angolan war.

walvis bay, namibia's only deep
ocean-gomg port, poses a single major
threat to any post-independent gov-
emment in namibia as long as south
afnca continues its claim over the
port. despite the united nations rul-
ing that walvis bay is an intcgral
part of namibia, pretona continues
to regard and treat the nortas part and
parcel of south afric}.

walvis bay is not only a vital
anchorage for imports and exports,
but provides a large military basc
and airstnp for south afnca to con-
tinue its destabilising tactics against
the neighbounng black african states.
this will enable south africatokcep
war away from its mainland. no
county has so far dared to launch a
direct attack on the south african
mainland while south africa has used
illegally occupied namubia as a spring-
board for its periodic incursions into
southem angola.

walvis bay has even greater im-
plications in terms of its relationship
to a fubure independent namibia. since
the port is part of south afnica, those
namubians residing in swakopmund
and elsewhere will need to have visas
to leave and enter the port. and a
horde of walvis bay residents em-
ployed at the rossing uranium lid,
outside swakopmund, will have to
periodically renew their visas to en-
ter and leave the port on their way to
and from work.

also, the sa officials travelling by
road to walvis will need to apply for
visas to leave and enter namibian
territory. walvis bay also stands as a
potential cover for any opponents of
a new namibian government, and
might as well provide for their base.

and the fact that pretoria and its

nrogates might use walvis bay as

: ing npp 435 two years

rope

ation in nemible, 10 mest a lot of
very kindy people and myself give a
mnall comribution to the country where
t have lived for nearly ten years. as
an emigrant i have no problem of
divided loyalites: yugoslavia is my
mother and namibia is my wife. the
first brought me into this world and
the second i have willingly chosen as
a partner for life. perhaps my letter
should be viewed in a similar, if not
the same, light.

it makes me sad when | see how
many born namibians do not use
their education and knowledge to
help their own country and work for
the benefit of their own people. this
makes things worse for those who
prefer to work for enemics of the
peaceful implementation of resolu-
uon 435.

i believe every responsible resi-
dent of this country should take the
ongoing process very senously and
uy their best to make it succeed.

this is an histoncal event, which
our children and future genesations
are going to learn about in the class-
rooms.

there are many powerful forces in
namibia working to see the process
fail and war and suffering start again.
they are the forces which, in the
past, were never in favour of inde-
pendence, and were planning some
sort of independence of their own
without internauonal recognition.

the south afncan government
was never serious about 435 and its
posiuon is sull unchanged. south
afnica really intended to reduce the
high cost of the angolan war and
switch it to namibia, which is much
cheaper. this is only possible with
its faithful puppets which have long
experience in doing ‘dirty work’.

we know, and pretoria knows even
better, that it is impossible to hold a
free and fair clection here when
koevoet has poopie at gunpoint. 11
would seem as though south africa
is trying to force untag to ‘wash ius
hands of this affair’ and diseppesr.
this would then give them the op

a misled person like yourself should

atraid of liars

in oshiwambo there is a proverb
which says: omufundji oku vule
omulodhi. it means a har is worse
than a witch. the saying continues: it
is better to accomodate a witch than
a lier.

lhave been baling to understand
the proverb of my ancestors. my
question has been, why did they look
upon liars with apprehension? (1 pould
be happy if someone could give fur-
ther clarification).

for many years we have been oul-
side our beloved motherland - parted
from our parents, sisters, brothers,
friends and comrades. we havc al-
ways becn dreaming of home.

it also pasned us when we were
told that some of our relatives or
fnends penshed in the bloody 23.
year war. therefore, we understand
what it meant when some of our
fellow compatnots were told that
their nextof kin were ‘eliminated’ by
swapo. these lics have caused
immense damage and confusion.

maybe our ancestors were afraid
of liars because what they said did
not only affect a limited number of
people, but the entre population. a
witch destroys only one or two poople,
and then that is the end.

when liars speaks of death, they
mean life; when they speak of de:
mocracy, they mean tyranny, justice
= injusucc, reconstruction = destruc-
tion, freedom = oppression or captiv-
ity, decolonisation = colonisation,
freedom from south afnca = de-
pendence on south afnca.

these are the people who nearly
destroyed the namibia peace process
by concocting lies that swapo com-
batanis infiltrated namibia on apni
1, while many of them had been in-
side already.

lies were fabricated again when it
was reported that swapo combatants
were moving south of the sixicenth

bel to prepare for a big incursion
into namibia - an absurd statement
indeed.

for the past few weeks since the

the dta has embarked upon some un-

waking to a bizarre sound from the

this not only reflects the way in
which the dta regards the people of
katutura with contempt, ic. through
disturbing their rest and peace: but also
their inherent racist ideology. they
don’t go around like this in ‘white’
windhoek. because for them, those
people or residents need their rest
dearly, while the residents of katutura
epparently don't.

allow me to be an ethnicist at this
moment by introducing myself as a
caprivian amd a proud ‘mafwe' for that
taattez. | wish to cxpress concern about
my fellow ‘mafwes’ who are support-
ocs of the dta. i am prood, and do not
heaitate to mention thet the mafwe are
people with « definite culture who
strive for good mora! norms aad codes.
theeefor what the dta is doing is not

respected mafwe tribal authority toler-
ates such actons | wonder
whether the tealises the reper-
cussions for itself.

however, let me sound a warning to
fellow namibians, particularly the
dtas. just as god liberated the leraelis
from the bondage of slavery to the
egyptians, god is now going to liberate
his sons, the namibians, from the yoke
of bondage from sa colonial rule.
never mind how stubbom pharaoh
was, the fact remains thai the israelites
were liberated from egypt as god de-
cided. never mind how stubbom the
south afncans/dta may be, the fact
remains namibia will be free.

i have a strong conviction that any-
one who stands in the way of god will
be drowned in the red sea this isa
good warning to the dta.

mr martti abtisasri and his team
represent moses in the peace process:
“history repeats itself’.

fellow namibians and fellow ca-
privians, fellow mafwes and the dta:
““t kanda ka i li twikiwe’': thas is, you
cannot put the country on your bead. it
is beavy and will break your neck.

we know the dta was totally
against the implementation of resolu-
bon 435. we call on this organisation
ot to involve itself in the peace proc-
ess with a manner of pretence, aiming
to disrupt and cause the process to fail.
it must not come owt with dirty ticks
and strategies of using the sadicals of
the community and school dropouts to
prevent the process from being run in
the letter and spirit of 435.

itis a good sign of ignorance to see a
person showing the ‘two-finger sign’,
shouting ‘demo’ and at the same time
beating, harassing and hindering others
from holding meeangs. it ia time the

aging them and the pupils present to

to swapo. is this what the dta will do
when it comes to power?

on the other hand people are ques-
tioning why swapo does not retaliate. it
has been directly involved in the proc-
css that has brought namibia to the
present political situation, it knows and
understands what is happening and
where it is heading, and it

work with both good and bad elements.
a parent socepts all its children. so let
us all come together under swapo; jet
us avoid fighting ome another, let us
know who the real enemy is.

finally i want to call on the mafwe to

that they respect and love one another.

we believe that we are onc people

the dta is being used by the

even the bible says if someone
slaps your cheek, then tum the other
cheek, but what happens if they slap
that one as well? i am sure that the
answer would be to retaliate in self

botha’s threat

i perceived with dismay the
threatening statement made by south
african foreign affairs minister,
roelof botha, on his recent visit to
windhoek to the effect that “if any-
thing unforeseen happens between
now and namibian independence,
which violates any of the agreed
principles his government reserved
the right to take whaicver stcps it

doomed necessury’’.

1 would like to remind the colonisers
that we did not invite south africa to
invade our beloved namibia and
subject it to colonialism and all that
gocs with it, and their presence here
has aiways been illegal, nor did we
consent to the german fascism of
von trotha.

we fought back tooth and nail
against these forces unul today when
the deeply yeamed-for freedom and
independence 1s about to be born.

we know south afnca is not
committed to genuine implementa-
tion of 435, and if it was not for the
heavy burden of war, which the oc-
cupier could not sustain, then the
future of this country would stil] be
locked in chains.

if any ‘unforeseen’ happens in this
country, as mr botha fears, then it
wil undoubtedly be the fault of pre-
tora. namibians are peace loving
people who have no intenuon of
invading other nations or neighbours.

mr botha should restrain his forces
and cease their clandestine activi-
tics. south africa must not attempt
to create a pretext to invade this
country to perpetuate colonialism or
insutute neo-colomalism.

it is unacceptable for the sadf or
sap to retum to our soil under any
circumstances.

an advertisement placed in this

lives, prevent disability, devclop

the idea that in order for our country
to develop we should not have a
defence force.

world with the first-ever democratic
election in africa’, bul let us not be
naive and unrealistic by being blind
to the possible destabilising forces
that surround our country. to those —

while 1 support all efforts of

that the culprits are brought to book

ruary 21.
might take the law into their own
hands and accused other political
partics in this country of alleged fail-
ure in condemning the recent killing
of three white residents of grootfon-
tem. he further wondered why the
murders had occurred after the adop-
ton of the constitution of the repub-
lic of namibia.

chief riruako seemed to be out of
wach with events in namibia. the
killing of irmocent people has been
common and prevalent, especially in
the north all along since the election.
many people were robbed af gun-
point of their properties and animals
and people killed in the process.

these incidents were reported ‘in
bocal newspepers and to my know!-
@dge both the administrator gen-
@ral, who is charged with maintain-
ing law and order and different per-

lies including the constituent as-
sembly, expressed concem and called
on the law enforcement agency 10 do
uncir level best to bring the culprits to
book and to end the lawless situation.

however, chief riruako, who wants
“peace to be maintained for all, not
for particular people or particular
organisations’ was in this country
and never called a press conference
to denounce killings, armed robbery
etc in the north part of our country,
bui anly when they happened in groot-
fontein. what hypocrisy on the part
of he dta president!

in the spirit of national reconcili-
ation, the sput of namibia demands
that we build a nation hand in hand,
irrespective of colour, race, religion
or ethnic, regional or party affili-
ations.

lastly, chief riruako accused
swapo and the ag who “‘had put
swapo in the position of government
before swapo had officially been

inaugurated as the new government!
it 1s not swapo or the ag which had
pul swapo in government. swapo
was elected, and the aq, as the rep-
resentative of the colonial regime,
would be the last person to put the
movement in government.

chief riruako must know that itis
the people of this country who hate
colonialism and sec their salvation in
swapo that put swapo in govern-
ment. itis the likes of chief riruako
who voted for the loser party - the

dta, who do not make any differ-

a big headache

the opporunists among namibians
-could cause a big headache for our future
government,

it seems to me thal most white namibi-
ans with an opportunistic nature are those
in the ‘pnvate business sector’ and blacks
are mostly former members of swatf,
particularly 10] battalion.

it is sad, and at the same time logical,
that some of the 101 former soldiers are
not prepared to terve their country in a
new namibia defence force, domanding
same of mora money than they got
tha colonial regimes.
this ls ‘logical’ to me is because if

they were not opportunists they would
have refused to jom enemy forces in the
‘first place.

what salaries were paid to our namib-
ian heroes, swapo plan combatants who
fought for so long to liberate namibians
from the oppressive south african re-
gime, including the swatf members?
do they feel no shame?

if they were in romania they would
serve life sentences or be executed by
firing squad. if they think they can get
more money elsewhere, they are free lo
look for better paid jobs.

it is their democratic nght to say no.

as far as | know namibians there are
cnough men and women who are ready at
any lime to secure our freedom, to guard
our borders and protect our peace and
defend our democracy, filled with a spirit
of reconciliation and forgiveness, willing
to work and serve the new-borm namibian

fighting chiefs

the tume has come for chief moral-
iswami to see that the border dispute
case has not been solved by the
supreme court and that his ancestors
were not the first to settled in the
eastern capnvi. the cinef and his
elements should then be prepared for
ins claim that he 1s the (munitenge)
supreme ruler, custodian and para-
mount chef in the east caprivi at the
expense of his counterpart.

chief moraliswam has been the
plannff in the border/chneftainstup
case for a long tirfe. it is time, now
tbat we are independent, to ask the
honourable president, as a neutral
person, tohelp resol ve the issue once
and for all so that both chiefs respect
ome another and restore peace in the
region. the chief ahould face reality
now. he knows very well how ex-
pensive the court case has been for
both masubia and mafwe factions.
people were forced to contnbute
because of his actions.

he obviously thought that by tak-
ing the case to court he would be the
victor. it is for these reasons i want
him to sit down and account for what
he has done. he has sown hatred and
mistrust instead of uniting the people,
as the role of chief should be. i see the
chief now gives a clenched fist sa-
lute; as far as i witnessed, he was a
udf and later an npf supporter in
the pac.

it is my wish that the president
should solve this problem to help the
two chiefs to know their tribal juns-
dictions. caprivi will not be the first
region to be demarcated, but chiefs
in other regions know their jurisdic-
tion and that is why there are no
senseless claims in other areas.

i once again appegl to the govern-
ment of the day to come up here and
show each chief where he begins and
ends so that the one cannot claim
supremacy over the other.

on forgiveness

try forgiving a friend who betrays
a confidence, or a co-worker who
tells lies about you. when the real
effort of forgiveness takes place, there
is nothing easy about it. instinct urges
us to pay back in kind.
some people are capable of heroic
effort in reconciling; others not. there
is usually a pause between the hurt
and the time when trust and love can
take root again. forgiveness is part
of a process that begins with hurt and
ends, inits final goal, with reconcils-
ation.
it works only when we become aware
of the depths and causes of the ange!
burning in us so that we can forgive
wholeheartedly and ensure anendur-
ing peace.
too often, we bypass forgiveness
entirely. we race from our hurt to an
arent reconciliation without tak-
ing stock of what must truly be for-
given before lasting healing can take
place. we try to get past the difficult
part too quickly,“for we have been
pro since childhood to keep
a stiff upper lip, pretend that we are
unaffected by the cruelty of others,

whether deliberate or accidental.
the ability to reconcile cannot be
tushed. we owe if to one another to
offer time to confront our hurts, to
face our wounds head-on, to vent our
emotions. only then can the real
healing begin.

when jesus said ‘love your enemy’,
he meant every word of it. we never
get rid of an enemy by meeting hate
with hate; we get nd of an enemy by
getting rid of enmity.
reconciliation depends on the situ-
alion and the people involved. in the
end, all forgivers do the same thing:
they restore self-worth to the of-
fender; they cancel a debt; they expe-
rience such peace that they lose the
urge to retaliate and live as freer
persons unshackled by the weight of
a hurt.

i refer to the article ‘pepsi boys -
lively lions share the spoils’ writ-
ten by conrad angula on may 28.

ths statements implying that the
namibian police are discriminating

also irresponsible.

tam convinced that you would make
a significant contribution toward
reconciliation and to peace and eta.
bility, if you order your reporters not
to acoept the version of ‘one furious
spectator’ about the policy of the

but rather to check such allegations
and eniotive utterances with the rele-
vant authontics.

between soccer administrators and
the police to work oul ways and
means to ensure thal soccer specta-
tors can enjoy the game in peace and
secunty. at such a meeting the po-
lice will explain their position and
their dilemma.

sisted on being physically fit and
faking the battalion for a run down
palm street every momung. every
white-owned dog in the area went
bananas, as the troops ran past in
heavy boots.

but my story has not ended...

two weeks ago, after a heavy fn-
day mght, i fell into bed, and at
o5h00 my nightmare began. out of
the base came the deep wail of a
bombing siren. i leapt from my bed
and jumped for my pants, images of
kassinga and ngiva pounding in my
head. 1 stumbled onto the lawn ex-
pecting chaos, but it was only the
troops being woken up.

nothing has changed. the base is
still there, slap~bang in the middle of

suburbia. in the early momings, the
air-raid siren goes off.

could t make a suggestion: that
whoever woes on duty at the base
knocks on bungalow doors to wake
up loops, of gets the troops to wake
themselves up! please, this is not

the base, t ask those in charge to
show consideration for residents.

in the past we canvassed against

that our new government would be

although the word reconciliation
has been created with the purpose of
forgiveness, peace and unity for all
namibian people, it remains unim-
plemented due to a lot of conflict and
provocation by former koevoet
members against former plan fight-
ers. the two groups fight against one
another and there is a lot of enmity
between them.

it has been observed that former
101 members provoke the freedom
renters and insult them and our lead-

p ‘tn swapo - the very people
wh achieved independence for this
country.

the plan cadres are already frus-
trated because of the long and bitter
war and subsequent hardship and do
not need to be provoked any more.

therefore the new government
under swapo leadership should make
sure that they ensure all weapons
have been collected from these for-

on proper leadership

i would like to comment on the |
pew organizations that have recently
been formed, namely, the tun
(teachers union of namibia) andthe |
nasem (the namibian student
education movement).

firstly, i would like to deal with |
the new student body. in regard to its
claims that it has been formed asa
‘‘seeutt of a leadership vacuum within |
the student community in namibia""’ |
and, secondly, that the existing stu-
dent organizations have failed to

*‘proper leadership for
students because of their
hoke with political parties’, i would
ttke to malice the following comments.

eis no mirprise to me to read such

an atticle because this is the case and

the namibian

bean to mislead and infuse ideas of
the past colonial administrations. in
my point of view, the student! move-
ment has boon formed to foster the
interests and political ideals of their
respective political parties who are
at present on ‘death row’.

they see clearly that nanso, which
has been a progressive student or-
ganization in the past, has won a
victorious fight against the regimo
thar illegally occupied our country, |
and which suppressed most of the
students and people of namibia.

there was no leadership vacuum |
in nanso. this can be proved by its
winning of the objectives it stood for.
nanso members and supporters have
been harassed, detained and even
expelled from schools because of
their political beliefs and quest for
freedom. to say that nanso has failed |
to serve student inferests, is mere |
bias. nanso leadership succeeded in
mobilizing students all over the
country. it made them realize that
their interests were being suppressed
and needed to be fought for. nanso’s
liberation standpoints, therefore, |
coincided with those of swapo and |

|

nantu.

nanso could not isolate itself from
swapo because they had common
goals to achieve. to fight a war in
disunity is to give the enemy victory
and therefore students needed to be |
linked in order to be free, get better
education, proper housing, and well-
equipped libranes, etc.

nanso did not look for or concen-
trate on student issues alone, mainly
because the dignity of the whole naton
was undespinned by the colonial
regime. asa student body consisting
of intellectuals, ithadtotake account |
of the socio-economic situation in °
the country. students cannot only be
freo at school and ‘unfree’ when they

go home. both students and their
parents needed to be liberated.
tam assuring the leadership of the

this nation from foreign domination
and influence. i appeal to the new
organization not to create confusion
among students countrywide. we
know whose interests they represent
and promote. they must stop swim-
ming in the pool of confusion. their |
organization was formed to counter-
act nanso that has stood firm in
opposition to the abuse of bnman
rights.

my question to them is: if nanso
failed to achieve what it fought for
and a leadership vacuum does exist,
then what have they achieved so far?

if you were serious, why didn’t
you form that organizatian months
ago, lo stand up against koevoet
elements which used to disrupt les-
sons, beat up students, and erect army
bases al schools?

with regard the formation of the
tun: it also has political motives in
their formation, which serve the same
purpose as that of the nasem.

¢ organization has not been
formed to strive for teachers’ umity
and interests but to counteract nantu.

tappeal to teachers country wide to
be careful and cautious before join-
ing any altemative union which seeks
to divide the unity which already
prevails in our nation. they should
join the organizations who strive and
work for peace, nationhood and fra-
ternity.

forward with progresnve people's
organizations.

| see follow former combatants who
are wandering around the streets of
namibia’s cities and towns.

being a formercombatant myself,
i feel that we are all neglected and
forgotten by the government that we
have fought for. we had no time to
eam a living in the past years, simply
because we were engaged in the armed
struggle for the liberation of na-
muibia. the struggle has been long
and bitter, many of our brothers and
sisters have sacrificed their precious
lives for the liberation of our mother-
land, others are crippled for life.

now that the struggle for political
independence is won, why is it still
continuing in cases like ours? we
suffered during the years of armed
struggle in the bush, but we still
continue to suffer, even after inde-
pendence, even worse than was the
case inthe bush. we have no jobs and
if one manages to get work, then
there is no roof over his or her head.

our qualifications, which some of
us obtained abroad, are disregarded
by employers, yet most of us have
leamed at institutions in independent
countries where there 1s no segrega-
tion or racial discrimination.

in namibia we are asked to pro-
vide the employers with bantu edu-
cation certificates which in my view
18 nonsense.

it is really disappointing to learn
that most of the civil servanis in our
government offices are former
koevoet members who were doliber-
ately put in certain positions by the

colonial regime. many of these people .

do not possess a standard 10 or col-
lege certificate like many of us do.
these people were merely employod
because of the colour of their skin
and they dominate in every workplace.

we have no chance anywhere. the
government should seriously look
into our problem and do something
about it. we read in newspapers daily
that the enemy of peace, unita, and
their collaborators are trying to cre-
ate conditions conducive for another
war in our country. yet the govermn-
meant does not want to allow all those
who are able-bodied former plan
combatants to join the national army.
are we ignoring the realities?

the enemy want destabilization
and poverty to take root here as has
occurred in angola and mozambique.
it is time to think twice and make
sure that the heroes and heroines who
fought for the liberation of this coun-
try should be at least fully integrated
into the police and national army in
order to defend the gains of the revo-
lution against enemy encroachment.

we want to see the changes for
peace and independence of our people
maintained by the loyal men and
women we now see wandering around
without jobs. reconciliauon must
make things balance.

the government! must see to it that
these brave men and women are
assisted by the state, oven if it means
creating a demobilization fund 20

law of the knife

i wish toexpress my feelings about
the violation of human nghts in
namibia. at this pount i would like to
urge my fellow namibians to respect
life more than money or property.
many people have lost their lives
since independence. mainly because
some people do not want to respect
the laws and constitution of the
republic of namibia which provides
for-the protection of life, and other
human rights.

the use of knives to kill others is the
order of the day in namibia, espe-
cially among young people. in order
to reduce or eradicate the problem
altogether, 1 appeal to the govern-
mem to introduce laws to prohibit
the carrying of knives in public places.
the knife is as dangerous as the gun,
and there must be punishment to
ensure that knife-users are deterred.
what we have to bear in mind is that
the killing of innocent people is a
violation of human righté in terms of
our laws,

note that the constitution says that
all human beings are bom free and
equal in dignity and rights, without
distinction of any kind, such as race,
colour, sex, language, religion,

social origin, p » birth or offer

the democratic government will tol-

erate being belittied and called all
so 8s of names, 1s the question in the
mands of so many namubians, and let
me assure the times and dta that
they are many.

i think now that the times is cer-
tain that there 1s no action that will be
taken: there are even times when it
revertstonaked racism in its descrip-
ton of ‘black’ african countries, while
reference to south africa creates the
impression of a docile dog creeping
with ifs tail betwoen its logs in front
of its master. lest 1 deviate, let me
return to the issue 1 am writing about.

the belief that whatever deliber-
ately negative remarks or unfounded

[

accusations are made against the
govemment will force it to collapse,
borders on insanity. boasting about
bnnging down the govemment singie-
handedly with such reports shock the
imagination of any human being. itis
with this in mind that i read of the
‘evidence on namibian coup’ in the
october 5 edition of the times.
the said newspaper reports exten-
sively on evidence given by josef
kleynhans, who told the court that
some people tned to recruit him fora
‘coup’ against the govemment. the
concept that itis only armiescapable
of staging coups, as repeatedly said
by the times, is s0 ridiculous, but
their attempt to create the impression

that the arms theft was only a minor
‘adventure’, is, i fee] an attempt to
downplay the seriousness of the crime.
the thieves will finally, in the cyes
of the times, be nothing more than
‘youths in search of adventure’.

i] hate to think what would have
happened if such a theft took place in
the previous dispensation and if the
‘adventurers’ were black and not white.

this comes after weeks of specu-
lation in tho same newspaper as to
whether there was really a coup plot
in namibia or not. it is interesting, to
say the least, that this newspaper
should now have a headline report on
the coup. one wonders about this
paper's sense of journalistic ethics,
for in the past couple of weeks it
decried the coup story which was
broken by the namibian as a ‘fig-
ment’ of that paper's imagination.

now the times of namibia will
probably become the champion against
the coup. it seems to be trendy for the
times to, on the one hand, deny the
existence of a coup and on the other
to be the first to report on evidence
given about it.

whether one calls it an intended
coup or not, is purely academic. in

fact, the academio masturbation about -
coup or no coup does not impress the
majority ofnamiblans. lat us at
tho facts: numerous arms .were sid
len, surely not to play ‘cowboys apd
crooks’, but to cause irreparable harm.

""unfair to aliens’ of october 2, by
‘fed-up alien’. it is clear from the
detter that the anonymous writer suf-
fers from racism. my concem here,
however, is to put the matter right.

first and foremost, i hope the writer
is aware that every country has a law
relating to ‘aliens’, ‘foreigners’ and
‘illegal immigrants’ or whatever one
prefers tocall them. such laws serve
a number of purposes. first, they
protect the security of the country.
second, to keep a record of aliens in
the event of a population census.
thirdly, to enable law enforcement
machinery to effectively control border
traffic.

in response to your letter, it is my
opinion that many foreigners who
came to namibia in the past five
years did not do so because they
loved namibia. neither did people
from south africa come here be-
cause they did not agree what was
happening there. after all, at that
time the same things were happening
in both countries.

if they thought what was happen-
ing in south africa was wrong, they
should have stayed and applied their
“skills and experience’ to exert pres-
sare for change. however, these
‘skilled’ people preferred to come
and tale of the brou
shout by the ‘orkilled labour"" of
namibia.

the government must adhere to
the constitution, which is the su-
prom law of the land. it applies to

' @veryone, whether govemment
omptoyee or not, or whether black,

white, asian, or african.
‘the govenument cannot give citi-
pots any foteignercisiming

foreigners arrived here for different
reasons. many of them were not
genuine. is it not surprising to you
that most people involved in dia-
mond smuggling, rhino and ivory are
foreigners?

you claim that ‘aliens’ and ‘south
africans’ are the only people with
skills. many south africans here came
because they could not be absorbed
in the south african economy. they
did not all come here with skills and
experience - the colonial policy was
to provide job opportunit#s here for
those people at the expense of the
namibians. namibia has been used
as a laboratory for upgrading and
training south african unskilled
labour.

the people who yame back from
exile are namubiaiccitizens. they
were bor here and their parents and
relatives are here.

they were fighting for the inde-
pendence of this country and are

Peace.19901019_page_1.txt,,"std 8 impact

i was made to believe that there is
_ aconflict of interests in this country
— in the field of employment.

it am saying this because previous
history shows that in the past job
apphcants were just taken in or
employed without pre-conditions. as
a result, there are many government
employees with less than std 8 quali-
fications.

the buming issue today is the std
8 certifitates and its impact on the
namibian labour force. as we start
to reap the fruits of our country's
independence which we have fought
and died for, lying ahead is a politi-
cally-motivated blocking mechanism,
the std 8 issue. now, how can one
enjoy the fruits of hard-won inde-
pendence, if he/she does not possess
a std 8 certificate?

where do we go for a living, when
you are likely to face three questions:
std 8 certificate; long-term job expe-
rience; and previous employer.

it is disappointing to have a door
closed in your face because you don't
have asb& certificate. what about
those with practical expenence?

this is a disturbing issue. how do
they expect someone who was forced
to leave the country and fight to
liberate it, to surmount this blocking
mechanism?

the government of this oountry
inherited a large number of people

with long-term job experience. why

— can’t they deputise these people with

_ lees eoxporicaced staff so that we can |

create mutual understanding and a
skilled labour force?

the std 8 question is promoting
division between the haves and have
nots.

iam thus suggesting to the law- :
makers that we get together and for-
mulate a 9ommon ma pou ne to how to
redress with rogers.

nurses on lunch

iam concemed about imper-

certain hospital. this is a prob-
tem. when a patient arrives for
treatment at o9h00, even though
he or she may be seriously ill
they are asked to wait until
14h00 for his/her treatment.

this is because nurses and

advisable for nurses to go on

f misch 21 means ..

there are only « few days
left before we celcbrate the
first anniversary of our hard-
won independence. it was 12
moaths ago when the popular
ruling party. swapo, the then
hberation movement which
gallantly fought and defeated
the then notorious forces of
occupation at the battlefront as
well as the ballot box, adopted
the policy of national recon-
ciliation, the policy of forgive-
ness and focus on the future.

first of all, let ue examine
the significance of march 21.
the date is and will remain an
illuminating day in the na.
mibian calendar. illuminating
in the sense that itis the day on
which the yoke of colomalism.
which was imposed on us, was
buried for ever.

it was the day on which
dignitaries from all over the
world joined the brave sons
and daughters of this country
to witness the burial of coloni-
alism by replacing the south
afncan flag with that of the
new republic of namibia.

it was a wonderful and
moving occasion, which pres-
ent and future generations will
never forget. it was a day on
which the nationalist fighters
stood hand in hand and said
‘look, our sacrifices have not
been in vain’.

as the freedom fightars were
rejoicing, those who fought
against the emergence of
democracy stood with their
hands on their heads.

why was it necessary to adopt
the policy of national recon-
ciliatian? the movement's aims
and objectives were to liberate
this coumtry from the then forces
of colonial oppression and
establish a government founded
upon the will and participation
of the namibian people.
uns achioved that, the

-——

colonial regime with the view
of the achievement
of democracy. with this in mind,
swapo opted for a policy of
national reconciliation which
is humane and suitable for
namibians.

the most striking aspect of
the policy is that it promotes
the values of equality and human
dignity. it intends to unite the
namubian people irrespective
of colour, race, nationality or
ongin. this policy deserves
our respect.

many have complained about

» the negative aspects of national

reconciliation but little has been
heard about its ments

the success of the policy
depends on the performances
of those implementing it. the
ments of this policy are more
than its dements. this policy
is, in my view, meant to pro-
vide a breathing space for those
harbounng illusions about the
past colomal system to adjust
themselves to a new era of
national independence, peace,
stability and the humane ap-
proach.

as we rejoiced on march 21
last year, we were equally
womied about what we had
inhented from the then noton-
ous colonial regime in terms
of debt, unemployment and
pobtical instability (the latter
with regard to tendencies of
tnbalism and racial discnnu-
nation based on colour)

the probleniis, how are we
going lo pay the socalled debt
without economic prospenty,
and how are we going to com-
bat the already deteriorating
unemployment situation with-
out economic growth?

the government's efforts to
combat the unemployment
situation will be meaningless
unless accompanied dy the will
and voluntary participation of
the ‘haves’ of our society.

we expected the electranic
and print mediatoplay a major
role in shaping the destiny of
our people. but at the moment,
its efforts aro feeble because
we aro divided. we have just

emerged from s unique oolo-
nial system, a system in which

our people were taught to behave
in a tribalistic manner. this
evil sysiom has contaminated
the minds of some members of
our society, making it difficult
for them to adjust to the new
era of independence. the media
should be offering guidance to
our people to create for them
opportunities to rebuild their
self-respect, restore their faith
and rediscover for themselves
their human dignity. regional
radio stations should be utl-
ised for the bene fil of people in
those regions.

oue of the government's
nian pnonties 1s education. it
1s the finest foundation of all
for the nation-building proc-
ess. its also the comerstone
upon which 1a rest our surest
hopes to build our young re-
public

as we approach the first
anniversary of independence,
we necd tn be devoted to the
cause of national building
through the process of national
reconciliation.

fauure to implement this
posinvely will effect the con-
cept of democracy in this coun-
try.

we cannot achieve any of
these objectives unless we are
hardworking, disciplined, law-
abiding and unplement the
policy of national reconcili-
ation un 2 positive light.

the reason why katutura

perhaps he could exert pres-

recent weoks have witnessed
various revelations about the

these revelations have once

these revelations have once
more strengthened the belief
of many namibians that sa
nypged the elections in favour

(tntal such time as the dta

their integrity and dedicanon

peace and independence has
cost the lives of many namubi-

it is my belief that 1n inter-

must beset up to investigate
the extent of sa involvement
in those elections.

namibia's lasting peace,

change have been oiled, ready
to tum and transform our soci-
cty in its writing of its own
history.

as we find ourselves envel-
oped in this vibrant situation,
brothers and sisters, we must
be careful that we do not create
a situation where privilege by
virtue of colour is replaced by
privilege by virtue of wealth
and whereby only the ‘haves’
enjoy the luxunes or creature
comforts while the ‘have-nots’
are forced to accept poverty as
their final destiny.

we who are govemed com-
rades must bear in mind that
our new namibian nation re-
quires of everyone of us to be
a new person, with a new mind,
a new heart and a new spint. i
also believe that the hope for
namibia does not just lie ina |
political system or with a spe-
cific government. it lies with
us, the people, black and white,
who have come through the
crisis and have had to change.
we need new minds, new hearts
and new spirits, hewn, as they
have been, from pain and
humiliation, from repentance
and forgiveness. therefore we
must not expect our govermn-
meat to perform muracles while
we ourselves have not begun

wecommend your govein-

know that the allocated funds
to this ministry will not solve
all the educational problemsio

i am writing to advise the
ministry of defence not to
misuse this time of peace.

too much of a good thing is
monotonous. soldiers in bases
around the country have no
work to do, except continuous
manocuvres and this brings
boredom.

on many occasions soldiers
are told to attend classes but
due to boredom they go absent
without leave.

my suggestion is that the
ministry should take advan-
tage of this, and utilise the
soldiers in bases inthese times
of peace.

it would be better if the
ministry could provide build-
ers to show soldiers how to
construct their own barracks
and provide them with bull-
dozers and tractors to lake part
in agneultural projects.

it we keep our soldiera busy
with productive tusks as wel!
as constructive ones, this will
give us a good reputation with
the nation.

soldiers need to be taught
skills so that they could join
workers’ brigades with better
qualifications whenever they
leave their posts,

the more they produce, the
more they will reserve; the more
they construct, the more: they
will protect; the harder they

the cabinet of the namibian
government for its decision to
withdraw the licence of thee

was a much needed sign to all
racists that the status quo can-
not be allowed to continue.

the policy of national rec-
onciliation has been abused time
and again by those who cannot
accept change and in fact are
still opposed to namibia's
independence. incidents of
racism frequently occur, espe-
cially in outlying areas, and in
my opinion the government has

_ been far too lenient in its ac-
tions thus far.

this encouraged the reac-
tionary forces to continue
‘business as usual’; workers
are still victimised tad exploited
while the ‘white’ privileges
remain untouched.

social justice 1s a prerequi-
site for peace and democracy

sion will send a clear signal
that racism cannot be allowed

dimensions, is key to the pro-
motion of real development in
namibia.

the time has come that a
change of attitude must take
place. women have now for
some time realised that we have

and political) and wisdom to
shape the future of this coun-

change society and liberate

cial, political, cultural and
economic).

struggle means awareness.
struggle means organisation
and unity. struggle means
courage, struggle means faith
and hope. we must begin to
build these up in our small

another. nobody can help in
this process more than women

i am taken aback when i think
of the socalled peaceful, but
violent mafwe protest against

me that the protest was backed

by muyongo’s dta. the same

ing albert buchane who was
the ngambcla of the group.
the dismissal was based on
the reason that he received an

now dead and buned. educa-

approved and not just because
the mafwe wanted it, as was

chief’s tribalism

i would like to refer to the
socalled revelations by chief
mamili published in the
namibian entitled ‘the mafwe
state their case’ on august 31.

if this revelation comes from
the chief himself then all peace
and freedom-loving namibi.
ans should without hesitation
declare him the 1991 cham-
pion of tnbalism - for it ap-
pears he is unable to think
beyond the tnbe.

the point i would like to
make to chief mamuli and a
small section of the mafwe
surrounding him is that the
cheapest colonisation method
used to colonise namibia was
through the existence of tnbes
- the championing of one tnbe
at the expense of others so asto
smoothly pave the way for the
bantustanisaton of namibia.

it is disappointing to learn
that chief mamili claims ka-
tima mulilo is a mafwe area.
capnvi knew no boundanes
even in the time of the colon:-
alists.

why should we talk of tribal
divisions and tnbal bounda-
nies at this time? what are we
going to benefit from tribal
conflicts apart from rolling back
the progressive idea of national
reconciliation the ruling party
is keen to implement in order
to mould a healthy and pros-
perous nation?

i am challenging chief

. tory he and his associates read

money for tribes

1 am very unhappy about the

| way money is spent by the
government on issues related
to tnbalism in caprivi. the
govemment of the day is no:
aware thatthe basubiais using
it to defend tribalism. on the
other hand, the mafwe are left
victims of the tribal acts of the
basubia, while the government
dangles its legs on the fence of
prospenty.

chief moraliswam should be
called to order by the govern-
ment. and those who were
involved in the unconstitutional
inauguration of the chief as
paramount chief be disciplined
accordingly. the basubia have
gone too far with their abuse of
democracy and now 1s the time
they should be given a lecture
to bang them tu their senses.

much has been said about
the basubia and the mafwe arc
fed up with them. if the gov-
emment fails to discipline them,
the mafwe are bound to doit

the military and police were

_ despatched to capnvi in the
name of mataining peace.
recently the basubia cheated
the government to say that
people are being lalled in the
capnvi and that there were
many in the moruary, many
injured and many admutted to
hospital. forces were des-
patched but found the claims
unfounded. what a waste of
laxpayers) monev the bas.
ubia should know tha: this
money is supposed to be used
for capital projects to the ad-
vantage of namibians and not
just one tmba: group. i call
upon taxpayers to condemn the
abuse of money un this man-
ner.

[in the history of namibia no
chiefhas ever been made para-
mount over one tnbe let alone
another chief's temtory. moral-
iswani 1s geographically not
really a chief because he lives
under the junsdiction of an-
other chief, and his advisors,
like likando and mwazi, should
make him aware of this.

the same chief should re-
member how his khuta used to
punish the youth to impress
the boers (mayumbelo, juluka
and sampati are alive and can
bear this out); and the same
basubia told the boers how
pro-swapo the mafwe were in
the past. the opposite is now
taking place with the group

claiming that swapo is theirs
and dta is for mafwe - what
double standards! j call on the
govemment to intervene and
to call the two chiofs to order.

whether the minister knows
what is happening in the police

accusations of the public are
not only aimed at the police
themselves, but against him as
well. :

the public is unhappy about
certain actions of the police
and feel there is room for lots
of improvement. as to your
repeated answer that you have
to report to the cabinet, the
public knows that you are
accountable to them, but that
cannot stop you from improv-
ing the police.

the behaviour of the police
is causing serious concem
among the public and reminds
them of the old colonial days.

an open letter to
un secretary general
dr boutros boutros gali

in view of namibia's sec-
ond anniversary of independ-
ence, i would like to express
my deservedly deep concer
about parts of our country still
under foreign domination.
whiting straight to you proba-
bly reveals my ignorance re-
garding the ‘correct method’
of communicating with you.
however, deliberate depriva-
tion and annihilation during
the tragic colonial era would
justify my shortcomings. no
wonder, namibia’s current
more than 50 per cent illiter-
acy rate. 7
nowhere in the world, at
of nations and subsequently
the united nations’ existence,
were more resolutions passed,
defied, overlooked and/or for-
gotten than in the world body’s
former ‘baby’ for which it had
direct responsibility.
the long colonial years di-
lapidated both namibia’s un-
renewable natural and human

still paying reparations to each
other after the two world wars.
regardless of her plunder at
the expense of growth, pro-
duction, literacy and self-suf-
ficiency, namibia has her sec-
ond anniversary of sovereignty
in debt and heavily dependent
upon imports.

worse still, more than 90
per cent of her imported com-
modities are handled in walvis
bay, her only deepwater port.
unfortunately, to our detriment,
walvis bay is apparently still
considered as part of south
africa. twelve, if not more of
namibia’s offshore islands are
also still under south african
control, thus effectively reduc-
ing the area covered by the
country’s offshore rights by
about one-fifth.

if part of the world body’s
responsibilities is to safeguard
peace, security, self-determi-
nation of member states: and
observation of good faith and
overwhelming justice towards

all nations, then namibia de-
serves its long-violated rights
and national integrity honoured.
i therefore, on behalf of the
namibian people, request your
organistion to ensure that jus-
tice prevails and that walvis
bay and the offshore islands
are retumed to the authentic
control of the indigenous popu-
lation - the namibian people. i
should be grateful to see the
new world order incorporating
all parts of this fragile world.

enemy of peace

as a patriot and 4 democrat, i

would like to respond to dr
petrus j krige’s letter which
appeared in the namibian on
april 3.

first i would like to make it
clear that the policy of na-
tional reconciliation was unani-
mously declared asa national
policy and not only the presi-

tions have to make sure that
the policy goes deep into the
roots of this country and is
clearly understood by all citi-
zens. this is the task of every
namibian. for that matter, dr
knige is not only against the
prevailing atmosphere in this
country, but he is also against
its independence, as such he is
an enemy of peace and justice.

there is no one in this coun-
try who would support his line,
except perhaps a few friends
who are suffering from the same
disease.

when we talk about recon-
ciliation, we mean business,
and we do not judge people by
colour, sex, political affiliation,

ideological differences or be-
liefs.

tt is untrue to say that the

government of namibia does
not allow judges and sport
participants from south af-
rica while it allows imports
from the same country. j think
you are joking, and are obvi-
ously not a namibian. if you
are, then you don’t need to get
a job, but re-orientation and
attend lectures to familiarise
yourself with what is happen”
- ing in namibia. you must be
the first ignorant intellectual
in namibia.

regarding culture, the gov-
ernment of namibia is ademo-
cratic one, and i can assure you
that it doesn’t limit rights and

freedoms as you maintain. .

everyone has the nght to en-
joy his or her cultural heritage
provided that this is in keeping
with article 19 of the
constitution of namibia.

i think that his theory is
misleading, if not inciting hatred
among namibians. since you
are a doctor in musicology,
maybe you need a medical
doctor to cure you of the dis-
ease called a superiority com-
plex and your racism. it is a
pity we still have people in this
country who are anti-progress

dent or government institu- .

and anti-nation building.

are you also saying that
namibians are unable to do
administrative work? and are
you saying that namubians
should not be appointed to high
positions? i believe that all
namibians, irrespective of
colour, should have equal
opportunities and be able to
run state machinery. don’t
underestimate the abilities of
namibian people, sir. it is not
only foreigners who can do
these jobs.

neither should you insult our
national anthem. ‘freedom
fight” has no undesirable or
negative connotations. it is only
your ignorant, anti-democratic
and racist sentiments. who are
the namibians who live inside
the country who don't share
the same sentiment regarding
this? you are an autocrat and
cannot talk on behalf of demo-
crats. who gave you the man-
date to do so?

j don’t think you can pre-
tend not to know why swapo
opted for the armed struggle.
there is hardly anyone, even
non-citizens of this country,
who do not know, this.

‘you are not only against —

swapo as the ruling y party, but

also against the namibian .

people. you do not even honour
people who sacnificed their lives
for the cause of this country
and now you want to be given
a job, probably as a director,
because you think you are the
best and only musicologist in
this country.

i feel sorry for you sir. be-

sides musicology, you appear
to be totally empty politically.
national reconciliation is our
policy and if you don’t like it
you should go to a place where
there is no peace and justice,
since you want the policy tobe
reversed. think twice, sir, and
learn from your mistakes.

were peor in tems of money
but neh in spirit. :

rts wealth jor the irown bene-
st butthe people of basibra
were song. for auuty years
thes fought against colonial
rule under bappa, the ba-
sibian peoples party. after a
long and paurful struggle,
basibia finally won its inde-
pendence. now the basibian
people were free to shape their
own nation.

“now we can be just like
other nations in africa”, sad
some of the people. “oh no”,
said others, “we must learn
from our brothers and sisters.
we will follow their successes
and avoid their mistakes”

basibia adopted a
constitution that was admired
all over the world because it
made basibia a tue democ-
tacy.

bappa swept to victory in
basibia’s first election as an
independent nation because
it promused to live up to is
name as a people's party. its
election posters said ‘united
we stand, divided we fall’
and ‘build a new basibia tor
all bas:bians’.

the ieader of bappa be-
came the first president of
basibia he ioved the people
of basia and was much loved
by them.

“we are all basibians to-
gether’, he said. “every man,
woman and child in this na-
tion is my family, and i will
not rest while any of my people
are suffering”.

“that is fine”, said some of
the members of bappa, “but
now we must talk about our
salaries. to keep the peace.
we have promised all the gov-
eminent employees who were
hired before independence that
their salaries will not be re-
duced. so we must pay our-
selves at least as much as
they are getting, or perhaps
even more”

“no”, said the president
“those people were robbing
our country. why should we
follow in their footsteps? be-
cause we work for the gov-
emument, we are given houses
to live in while many of our
people are homeless. the state
even gives us pensions and
medical aid. we will pay
ourselves modest suanes. and
thave state house to live mn
and a government car to travel
in - i will be well taken care
of. my salary must be the
lowest of all”.

“but, comrade president’,
the others cried, “you cin't
do that. you are the father of
the nation. surely your salary
must be the highest. no leader
of any other country would
do such a thing”.

‘and the president replied
“you say that | am the father
of our nation - what father
would eat while his children
go hungry? a true leader does
not separate himself from his
people. let basibia be differ-
ent. letus set an example for

the world!”

the neat des some of the
president's advisors came to
talk to him adout cars for the
government. “of course,
benz's’. they sad “the ba-
sibian people would lke to
see us urcars that wili swt out
status as leaders”.

“no”, said the president, “t
do not think so. we willnecd
transport, but we must save
as much money as possible
for developing our nation. no
one working in this govem-
mentis going to drive a fancy
car”

“but comrade president”,
they said, “all the highest
government officials before
independence drove expen-
sive cars. and so do heads of
state all over the world!”

“yes”, said the president
“but we will be different. we
will set an example. a truce
leader does not separate
himself from the people. you
must remember that most of
the people of basibia cannot
afford a car at all. find us
some uexpensive cars that
will get us where we need lo
go""

“now, commie president”.
said the advisors, “we need to
build a new place for parha-
ment to meet""

“but why?”, said the presi-
dent, ‘is there no place where
we can gather to do our work?""

“yes”, they said, “but itis
old and dingy and we will be
crowded there. we want a
fancy room with anew carpet
and leather chairs”.

“no”, said the president, ‘t
will not spend any money on
govermunent buildings until
every single person in our
nation has a home to l.ve in
until thatday, we must get by
with what we have”

the next day tne president's
advisors were back again.
“comrade president”. they
said, “we will have to make
many trips to other counmes.
we must share ideas and
discuss issues and make agree-
ments with the people of other
nations”.

“this is true”. said the presi-
dent, “we must do some tav-
elling. but we must always
think of savug money. none
of my ministers will fly first
class, and we will always stay
in the cheapest hotels”.

“but comrade president,

ister must travel in style. you
would not want your mmunis-
ters to be crowded and un-
comfortable”

and the president said “how
can you talk about being
crowded and uncomfortable
when have seen some of our
people living in the single
quarters, 10 and 20 people
sleeping in one tny room,
every night of their lives?”

“but what about you, com-
rade president?”, they said,
“you must have your own
plane forefficiency and s¢cu-

rity”.
“very well, bul we must
find the’smallest, cheapest,

simplest plane that can take
me where [ need to go. a true

leader does not separate
himpelf from the people. we
are going to setanexample to
the world”.

it was not long before a
delegation came from parlia-
ment to visit the president.
“comrade president’, they
said, “this cannot continue.
we are basibia’s leaders. we
fought for independence and
now we deserve our reward”.

“yes”, said the president.
“but we did not fight alone
would any of us be here in
goverment today if we had
not had the support of our
people? all basbians deserve
the reward of a new basibia
where all can prosper”.

“but, comrade president”,
they said, “no other country
in the warld operates this way.
we will be the laughing stock
of afnca”.

“no”, sad the president, “7
think you are going to be sur-
prised”.

and it was not long before
anew spint came to basibid -
aspiritof giving and sharing.
government muinistnes held
compeutons to see which ones
could save the most money
somme of the civil servants who
had been hired before inde-
pendence were so embarrassed
about their high salanes that
they asked for salary culs.
even private citizens sold ther
fancy cars because it was so
unfashionable to be seen in
them.

and the government spent
money on health care and
education and literacy train-
ing and development projects
and social secunty payments
for the old and unemployed.
it was not long before the
standard of living of every
single person in basibia had
nsen. no one was hungry.
children were healthier.
everyone in basibia had a
home, and almost everyone
could read. ard the govern-
menthad been so careful with
its money tha: basibia was
not dependent on foreign aid.
basibia was truly free.

the president was respected
and admired more than any
other leader in any county in
the history of the world all
over basibia people said “a
true leader does not separate
himself from the people”. they
voted for bappa again and
again, and basibia remained
peaceful and prosperous.

and soon basibia was fa-
mous. no other nation had
ever dared 10 be so different.
visitors came streaming in
from ail over the world 10 see
this remarkable place. new
investors were attracted 10
basibia because tl was so
unique. people in every land
recognised the wisdom of the
president of basibia and he
was awarded many honours
(which he always accepted in
the name of al! basibians).

basibians had once said
“we must be like all other
counties”. now people in

othercountries said “we want
to be like basibia”

and thatis how one small
nation began to change the
world

the jet outcry

it has never been part of my
culture to engage myself in
public debates which are being
over-emphasised for polincal
gain.

in the face of the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an r80 mil-
hon jet for the government
and officials of the republic
of namubia, i was faced with
several questions which i could
not help to answer.

i fully concur with the fact
thatour county faces numer-
ous problems, some short tem
and others long term. take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane

now the question is whether
it ig tue that those ‘muyon-
gos’ who presuppose that the
r8o million could have been
better spent uf used for tehet
programmes are more sensi-
tive to the realities in na-
mibia? if so, how far back
have they (muyongos) been
so critical about the way in
which taxpayers’ money has
been spent for the purchase
of things such as casspirs and
mirages by their regime, the
former interim government?

or, docs muyongo wantus
to believe that the money mus-
used on the purchase of war
material at the ume of their
rule was ‘ess than r80 mil-
lion? and was it not taxpay-
ers’ money?

this country has inhented
a debt which i has to repay
due to the misuse of funds
and the cnminal war which
was impesed on our people.
again, does muyongo want
us to accept that the drought
and other social evils in our
country today are new hap-
penings? t assume not.

unemployment. hunger, [0
mention but a few, are the
legacy of the past history ot
the country. even at the tume
of successive colonial regimes.
the problems were there.

as these problems did not
prevent them (the muyongos)
from purchasing wanton war
matenals which ran to bil-
ons of rands which this
country is left to repay today,
likewise, should these pre-
vent the legitimate govern:
ment from purchasing a plane
which will enable the presi-
dent and other government
officials to maintain contacts
with the outside world for the
benefit of the people of this
country?

even if the plane were not
purchased, could there be

t is surprising that
government and pectin
the office of the prime min,
ister is prepared to mislead
public opinion by appointing
someone to investigate the
acquisition of lang by only
three people and especially
in the communal areas. that
office being responsible for
the implementation of the land»

- recommenda-
tons could have started there

to solve the national issue of
land.

itis also surprising that the
government, whenever it talks
of the legal or rightful acqui-
sition of land, only concen-
trates on communal land. let
it be stated here categorically
clearly that we the namibian
people, and especially those
of us who laboriously fought
to return back our stolen land,
did so for the whole of na-
mibia including the socalled
commercial farmland.

lasting peace and stability

in this country could only come
if equitable distribution of land
is done now and not later. the
question of senior officials
acquiring land only demon-
strates to us that people are
hungry for land. lf senior of-
ficials have the means of us-
ing their official positions to
acquire the land, the mass of
our people who on numerous
occasions have demonstrated
publicly to have the land ques-
tion settled, may one day take
up arms to revoke the present
status quo as far as land own-
ership is concerned.

it is hurtful to note that the
land price is artificially made
to be exhorbitantly high to
benefit those who forcefully
took control of our people
and ownership of our land.
once cannot accept that in
windhoek it is practically im-
possible to buy a piece of
land to build a dwelling.

so, mr prime minister, we
the silent majority, who fought
for the liberation of this coun-
try and suffered imprisonment
and detention for the libera-
tion of this country, who dem-
onstrated fearlessly in the
streets of windhoek, katu-
tura, mines, schools, did so to
ensure that namibia is free.
we who voted the swapo gov-
emment to power want our
land now. we expect you
urgently to implement the land
conference recommenda-
tions. the more delays to the
solution of this probicin. the
‘more our path::. - will run
out. land is a fundamental
right of every citizen of our
country. land is the source of
life, the key to development

0 traditional leaders
on behalf of those communi-
hes. it is the only way that
those who have a desire to
own land will have access to
it.

if this suggestion is not
workable, may i ask the gov-
¢mment to put the question to
the electorate during regional
elections which are due be-

fore the end of the year. i
think that the verdict of the

majority of people is neces-
sary. my verdict is that we
are being held hostage by an
unpatriotic few who think of
namibia in terms of their own
benefit alone and who through
their access are misleading
public opinion. commercial
farms are not touched now,
butare they able torespond to
the urgent need for food in
this country? i am pretty sure
and convinced that if access
to land was easy, the effect of
the present natural calamity
would not be the same. be-
cause more people could have
engaged in food production.

i want to point out that the
namibian food market is rela-
tively stable because the pres-
sure is reduced by the com-
munal land which provided
71 per cent of the livelihood
of the inhabitants of those
areas. now the population of
both animals and people is
increasing, and the ecology
has taken its toll because of
the way in which the land has
been over-utilised. the logi-
cal solution is therefore the
urgent need to solve this
question. we want our land
back.

the earth summit presently

highlights the precarious po-

in because of the short-sighted,
profit-oriented exploitation of
its natural resources.

it also shows that if man
has learned anything from

a few days from now,”
namibians from all walks
of life will commemorate
heroes day on august 26.

significantly this is a
remarkable day, because of
the nature of the liberation
activities which occurred on
that day between the indige-

ters of this country and the
then colonial forces al
ongulumbashe in the north-
erm part of the country.

those liberation activities
germinated or brought about
national independence and

peace at last

a es a

peace has descended
py} upon windhoek west

once again. the srudents

celebrated their ‘cul-
| tural’ festival and resi-
gents were powerless tc
defend themselves from _
the onslaught. :

in case one is accused
of exaggeration, | am
talking about four nights
(i fell askeep by 3am) of
disco music blasting
| over the entire area -
_ | every syllable of every
| song trespassed closed

windows, locks doors,

earplugs - right into the
| furthest crevice of one’s
| | bedroom.

the police were also
powerless to restore
peace because vice-
chancellor peter
katjavivi and dean
kandetu “had given their
permission”. acomment
from the minister of
home affairs would be |
appreciated on this point, :
since when can two in-
dividuals muzzle the
police force from de-
fending peace-abiding
| cituzens?

a strange state of af-
fairs - vice chancellor
katyavivi and dean
kandetu held control
over the police and the
windhoek west taxpay-
crs, rate-payers, rent-
payers - those mere—
mortals who have to
work for a living.

the two university —
chiefs were indifferent |
to residents’ direct ap-
peals as well as police
wamings after the first
night's assault. this
could be due to several
reasons, all worrying:

- perhaps they had in
fact lost control;

- of perhaps they were
trying to ingratiate them-
selves with the students?
very cheap!

- perhaps they consid- |
ered it an important les-
£0n in democracy for the
future leaders of our
country. those privi-
leged students are more
entitled to rights than
workers.

considering this was
not the first rowdy cam-
pus rumpus and thanks
to the two liberal univer-
sity heads, it will obvi-
ously not be the last, per-
haps windhock west

~ on civil service

it is only when we the
civil servants are well-
informed about the eth-
ics and responsibilities
of civil servants that the
majority of staff mem-
bers will be able to ad-
just themselves to the
ongoing restructural
problem.

it is obvious that the
progress, pf any country.
is seriotisly jeopardised
when the civil servants
are not well informed
about the ethics and re-
sponsibilities of civil
servanis.

in his address during
the workshop organised
for permanent sceerctar-
ics at gross barmen, the
right honourable prime
minister, comrade hage
geingob, emphasised the
following:

* gucucs al govern-
ment offices: .

* the need for perma-
nenlsecretarics lo assess
people's feelings about
the quality of service they
receive,

* terminally buresu-
cratic offices:

*sense of commilment
and dedication;

* the use of the tel-
ephone:

* recruitment, promo-
tion and responsibility
and accountability.

il is my personal un- |
derstanding that civil '
servants must be acutely
conscious of the crucial
role they play in achicv-
ing government abjec-
tives of bringing about
peace, orderly develop-
ment and prosperity to
the country. obviously,
we can only achieve this
through the act of creat-
ing awareness and
through individual com-
mitment.

all the remarks made
by the prime minister
reflect the daily occur-
rence in individual
ministeries. some per-
manent secretaries de-
cide to be exclusive and
some are so dismissive
that they are no longer in
contact with theirstaffin
particular and the public
in general. some resort
to so much secrecy that
they are nol aware as (0

confidential and which

Peace.199401028_page_1.txt,,"in praise of ruling party!

allow me to express the feelings of ruling party
members in your newspaper. we in swapo are
committed to democratic principles and therefore
swapo ts calling on registered voters to exercise
their democratic nghts to vote in the coming general
elections.

we are not campaigning fora two-thirds majority
but for the overwhelming majority to rule this
country. itis nota seeret that we are ruling, and we
have and will continue to rule namibia according to
the democratic structures put in place by swapo.

we in swapo believe and know that democracy
will stay forever in this country.

other parties have often relied on tribalism and
racism to promote their cause and they therefore can
claim to represent namibia as a whole. it should
therefore be a wonder that swapo has provided four
and a half years of peace and tranquility in namibia.

we live in peace today because of the commit-
ment of swapo to seck unity in diversity in our
country.

in spite of the fact that some opposition parties
have insulted s wapo leaders personally, itis swapo’s
leadership and maturity that has never wavered
from the commitment to freedom of speech.

in the past years swapo has committed itself to

nation-building, knowing that namibians deservea
government that has priorities as they do. the
swapo leadership has ensured development and
they also believe there must be contact between
government and people at all levels. that 1s why
swapo has branches and sections at grassroots
level.

the foreign investment act was passed, which
regulates the framework tor foreign investors. in-
come tax was reduced twice. job creation was one
of the top priorities.

in the next five years swapo’s priority will be to
secure existing jobs and create new ones. for exam-
ple the free trade zone will create more jobs for
namibians and that is part of swapo’s priorities for
the next five years.

tourism will be expanded and housing, water,
electricity, education, health, agriculture and fish-
eries will be promoted.

therefore in the next five years swapo will accel-
erate change by creating new opportunities for
namibians through economic growth, better educa-
tion and health services and more jobs.

fulrilled the promises it made in 1989
an how many people have used the
falcon jet?

of course swapo fulfilled its prom-

duced the unemployment rate. we are
how living in peace, no more
‘makakunyas’ destroying our maize
fields and beating up people and
swapo has buried apartheid forever.

with regard the jet, how many peo-

to use 1t? the falcon is not a taxi but
wan sport for the president and his min-
isters.

i strongly believe people will not

president nujoma should not con-

since then, the govern-

the problem. as aresult,

were affected.

the clashes which
threatened to erase the

383 people and not |

500 as reported in your

000 people had been dis-
placed from their
homes. despite the sen-

some people have been
busy spreading the mes-

Peace.19960614_page_1.txt,,"hanekom has been re.
ported as advising the
hospitality assoctation
of namibia (han) at the
otzanisation’s recent
congress, that jt should
decide whether it wants
4 “free, unregulated
market” or a regulated
one. itis a point that the
prime minister made
some time ago. as the
prime minister and min-
ister hanekom have
both said, han cannot
have it both ways.
minister hanekom
also requested that our
association and han
should try to reach
agreement on the mini-
mum number of rooms
that an establishment
should have to be recog-

mised under new legisla-
tion. we must point out
that minister hanekom
is essentially advocating
a regulated market, sim-
ply for the sake of what
he hopes will be some
degree of peace in the
industry. but such a
compromise will not
bring peace, because it
will not address the one
question that we have
always posed: why
should successful small
businesses be driven out

‘of business, just because

they are small?

mr johnnie hamman,
the new chairperson of
han, is reported as say-

a

ing that han has re-
duced its demand for a
minimum number of
rooms, from ten to five
“to enable new legisla-
tion to be passed”. in
saying this, he pretends
that han have made a
generous concession.
but it is far from being
8enerous; in fact, it is
cleverly constructed 0)
that, if it were imple-
mented, it would wipe
out the businesses of 95
per cent of our members,
not to mention the busi-
nesses of many others
who are not members of
our association. perhaps
we should share in this

the namibian

spinit of generous com-
promise, by stating that
although we cannot ac-
cept the wiping out of
the business of 95 per
cent of our members, we
will accept the destruc-
tton of 65 per cent? or
would 55 per cent be
sufficient for mr
hamman and han?
what mr hamman
and some members of
han are proposing is,
in fact, much more than
the destruction of, say,
thirty or fifty successful
small businesses. they
are proposing that new
legislation should out-
law the prospect of most

namibians ever being
able to share in the ac-
commodation imdustry
of their own country in
an cnurcpeneurial way.
they are effectively pro-
posing that no home-
stead in the north of na-
mibia should be able to
offer accommodation to
tourists. they are effec-
lively proposing that no
resident of, say, rundu
or otjimbingwe should
employ the facilities at
her or his disposal to of-
fer accommodation
commercially. they are
effectively proposing
that no namibian with-
out access to capital re-

» mr hanekom

sources of at least half a
milton dollars (at inter-
est rates of above 20 per
cent) should be able to
enter the accommoda-
tion industry. and they
are demanding that the
namuibtan state should
ratify this discrimination
against its own citizens.

we call upon the me-
dia and the public to rec-
ognise that this issue is
not simply a matter of a
disagreement with han
and the budget and
home accommodation
assocrauion. it is a mat-
ter of principle: and that
principle involves the
question of whether or

not the majority of
namibians, who were
denied meaningful ac-
cess to economic activ-
ity under apartheid, will
continue to be denied it
under new legislation of
the type proposed by
those who benefited -
and stull benefit - under
the outdated ordinance
20 of 1973. if members
of han are successful
in their demands, then
economic reactionaries
in other sectors will be
encouraged to attempt
the same.

they go to the extent

of crime in our country, ¢.g. theft,
murder, rape, metal and physical abuse,

avoid places like night clubs because
these are very dangerous places for a

Peace.19971003b_page_1.txt,Windhoek,"guilt on his mind after death

yes. thisishow we have

atl fourned of the death

of moses garocb. now
hat he as dead, moses
gurocb will be a differ:
ent man. different from
the moses garoeb who
lived during the libera-
tion movement. on the
occasion of his death,
may i convey, through

this newspaper, my con-
dolences to those who
loved and appreciated
him as father and hus-
band.

may the “unusual” re-
avuion to his death make
them an exception. at
this ime of sorrow f do
not want to add insult to
injury of mr garoeb’s
fumily.

mfoses garoeb dies as
inan with guileon fis
mind. he has totally

failed to openly admit
thathe was, together with
others, responsible for
murdering many inno-
cent sons and daughters
of the country. although
he died a troubled death,
he is in his motherland.
he was buried as a
“hero” in disguise.

fam bitter. moses
garoeh has left his po-
hitroal successors to in-
berst blood stained

“files”,

in that sense his death
isunumely. they are left
with unanswered ques-
tions about the lubango
genocide.

i have always urged
swapo leaders to clear
this dark part of our re-
cent history, but with no
success.

will we have to wait
until the last butcherdies
and been afforded a he-
ros funeral before we
find answers to this ques-
ton?

today many families
are cry ing for their loved
ones who were murdered
by the notorious swapo
security menin lubango

of which moses garoeb
made a part. he has never
been and will never be a
hero as far as i am con-
cemed. i have seen him
victumising us. lucky
enough, i have survived
to tell the tale. for as
long as the fate of the
lubango victims is not

cleared | will die with a

troubled hean and na-
mibra wall never know

genuine peace.

i know just as every-
one does, that anyone,
good or bad, can be
named a hero as long as
his/her comrades are in
power. that is why the
“heroes” of the apartheid
era are now removed
from the face of na-
mibia. streetnames have
been changed because
friends of the apartheid
“heroes” are no longer
in power.

for those who glorify
moses garoeb as a hero
of the namibian people,
justremember that he di-
rectly participated in the
brutal killings and exter-
mination of my brothers
and sisters in lubango
and zambia.

we are still mourning
their deaths. our parents
did not have the privi-
lege tobury their beloved
children and husbands.

i started this paper by saying nujoma should go
and not have a third term. why? the regime that i
have descnbed here is his. he is the president! he
has the power to change through dismissal, effec-
uve reshuffling of his cabinet, caforcemen of
policy, maintaining political serutiny of his politi-
cal employees (the ministers, deputies, pss etc).
he had almost eight years to prove that he is not
only from kahao, but from each part of the coun-
try. that instead of constructing a tarred road to his
own homestead, he coulc have constructed one to

national patriotism to oppress, harrass and persecute

as a woman, i see peace as a birthday cake. it takes
a lot of ingredients: patience and love. peace is not
created by one person. a refugee woman is the target
of rape, violence, harassment, prejudice and mostly
the offenders go free, unpunished and ready to repeat
their offences. there is no tangible ‘piece’ of peacc.

__swapo has lost its vision for namibia

to us young people of

this country during the

years of the 1960s and

1970s, swapo sy mbolised
the mage of equality. jus
tice and freedom for all
the people of namibia

the prevailing situation
then was one of oppres-
sion, denial of justice and
human rights for the
greater majority of the
black and coloured popu
lation of our lund there
acre laws rastituted such
as job resers ations, bantu

humiliating and restrict:
ing the human spirit of
our people for generation
upon kenerahon the pot

was boiling and an explo-

ston was inc itable. that
rowhy the message of

swapo found much sup
pon and sympathy among
a broad strata of our op-
pressed populauion.

larl. in the baster and

acopenly proclaimed our

tans imstances we were
denicd basic privileges
that “ere normal in our
bul we perse-
sered because we were
convinced that swapo’s
viston was the right one

for it “was a vision
where people of all col-
ours. tribes and origins
would take hands and
build a new namibia, free

was a vision where we

would be levelled in terms
of pob and educabonal op-

insutuuons would be done
farrly. jt was a vision
where no one tnbe would
again try to dominate over
the others. it was also a
nason where all
namubians live in peace
and tranquillity, where no
namibian would again be
a political refugee or flee
their homeland because of
politcal intimidation and
tear

it was because of this
common vision that the
support for swapo was so
broad among the nami-
bian people. it was be-
cause of this common vi-
sion that the support for
swupo was unwavering.
for many it was a vision
for which they were pre-
pared to sacrifice their
fnends, family and posses-
sions.

for many others it was
a vision for which they
wese preparcd to lay
down their lives. for
many today, however, the

 . -_£.. ._._ i fh

shining vision of swapo
has become a great disap-

pointment. vow muany unies
vision thes shattered.

why?

in simpke terms. swapo
has for the past cight ycars
that it has been in poltucal
power in namibia, done
nothing but emulate all the
evils of the past apartheid
regimes. tt has instituted
one of the most corrupt
systems of self cnnchment
by political leaders and
their close friends and
relatives, [thad created an
elite system whereby a
small clique denves all the
benefits atthe detment of
the deprived. poverty
stncken population, [thas
insttuted tnbalism of the
most naked kind in the
civil service and
parastatals.

the swapo-govern-
ment has squandered our
resources by the mishan-
dling of the national
budget as was again re-
cently pointed out by the
auditor general. it is ap-
parent that the swapo
government ts just not in-
terested in maintaining

any fiscal or monetary
discipline.

vive de the renult of
competent and unquah
fied people being ap-
pointed to responsible
positions merely on the
basis of their ethnic and
tibal ongin. the govern
ment ts using legal means
to achieve illegal ends it
is thus clear that the ac-
tions of the present
swapo leadership have
deviated drastically from
the capectauions of the
masses of our people

that brings us to the
crucial questions at us
juncture in our histors
what is to be
done?

that is the question that
was asked by lenin when
mother russia laid: shut
tered because ot
maladministravon, cor
tuption, cthnte contlicts
and tsar dictatorship this
question also has to be ane
swered by nammbians al

a lot has been vad
about multi-party de

especially in namibia it
ts thus worthwhile to

consider a few important

'ssues in this regard

worldwide, bul par-

teularly in africa, his-
tory has shown that, un-
fortunately, most new

by personal ambition
and by hatred of the 1n-

by a proper analysis of

ples are plentiful, but for
the sake of brevity, only
two will do for now
* the movement for

(mmd) in zambia, was
a loose alliance of

strange  bedtellows

whose only claim to

fame was hatred for

kaunda and unip the

mmd capitalised on the

economue hardships to

oust kaunda and propel
themselves (o power

now that the mmd are

incumbents, and noting

that they (oo can now be
unseated easily because
the economic maladies
did not disappear despite
their earher promises (o
the contrary. by the same
kaunda they ousted,
they decide to pre-empt

its deepest economic on

one may ask ‘but
what has this got to do
with namibia?’ well,
everything. namibia got
its independence on the
morrow of the new
monopolar world domi-
nated by the usa. the
western countries first
regarded themselves as
midwives of namibia’s
independence, now they
have gone further and
granted themselves the
rights of a parent! they
forgot the namibian
goverment has a mind
of its own. swapo set out
to create a namibia en-
trrely in its own image
and to re- integrate it into
mother africa

to top it all, swape ts
seen to love the things
that westemers hate, and
vice versa

* swapo started op-
posing homosexuality,
like mugabe. in the west
homosexuality 1s a fash-
1on statement

* they started to be
vocally pro-afnca.

* they started to
amend the constitution
to allow for a third prest-
dential term the west
fumed, even though in
germany helmut kohl
was running for his
fourth, wrong. fifth
term. the uk still does
not have a written con-
stitugion while ours ts in
cyberspace.

* worst of ali, na-
mibia defied america by
sending troops to the
drc, again with
mugabe.

... and so do liberation movements

why as it that fiberation movements, whenever they ing ground for lazy. unaccountable, non-transparent,
come into power over afnca, tum out to be quite a

uademocratic, unresponsible, complacent : and ha
disappointment after a pernod of time?

dunng the stroggle and after independence, the ex- 4
pectations of the masses run very high. leaders are ¢
regarded as heroes who would deliver the long-awaited . extied
treedom and socio-economic uplifument.

* now namibia is op-
posing nato’s killing
spree in yugoslavia

so namibia must be
punished. but how?
there ts no economic
ctisis, no military insta-
bility on the contrary,
there 1s peace and stabil-
ity, in fact too much of
it! how about creating a
‘wirtual crisis’ yet the
influential newspapers
write about corruption,
self-aggrandisement,
megalomania etc let
there be headlines about
deaths 1n the congo, in-
stability in zimbabwe,
about a resurgent unita,
fictitious human rights
abuses in namibia. in
short, target the middle
class and create in them

a hunger for change
there is plenty of
money in the western
world for any projects or
activities that purport to
protect and promote de-
mocracy, human rights
and environment. so
any of you guys can cre-
ate a party, just make

sure words like democ-

fecy and human rights
feature strongly.

so, will the new par-
ties in namibia make an

unpact? well, ume wall
tell we must, however,
remember that culing
parties develop enviable
strategies to remain in
power and because there
isno real crisis in na-
mibia apart from the vir-
tual paper crisis it is
much simpler for the rul-
ing part to counteract

any ‘euphoria’ created was

by the new party
the 1999/2000
budget can be regarded
as the opening shots for
the ruling party even
the staunchest critics of
goverment are ata loss
for words. the problem
of plan fighters, which
the new party wanted to
tide on, seems to be
tackled once and for all
there is a tax breeze for
everybody, and both la-
bour and corporate cit-
zens are all happy. in-
cluding the fact that they
were consulted!

swapo will now fire
more shots: his excel-
lency donatedn$5 000
to kick start a fund for
the aged; he even danced
with senior citizens and
was praised lavishly by
the who regional direc-
tor for africa

* the government do-

nated the cultural house
to the ovahlerero,

* the presidential

commission on educa-
tron wall table its report
in september and imple-
mentation can only en-
hance the image of the
bovcrament.

* the gender policy

* the government can

run by the state (as in
the ex soviet union) or
left to the so called free

not be made to work in

don't need bill gates

interests itreally works.

let us democratically
strip this parasitic mi-
nority of its exclusive
ownership and control
of the means of living.
let us make this world
the common property of
everyone in it. free off
the shackles of the mar-

time to reclaim our world

ket and the tyranny of
the state, we can indeed
create a decent life for
everyone, freely giving

cording to our needs. all

previously the rehoboth mission was infiubited by
the swartboor nama clan, but by the tine tic basters
amved, they had abandoned the area for ogimbingwe
because they were involved with conflicts with jan
jonker afnkaner.

the basters never took land or anything clse from
anybody in namibia. the rehoboth area where they
first settled was totally unoccupied and an open area
devoid of nama or hereros. numencally it was also

upossble tor small clans like the swartieans ead
others to hase occupied un urea the size of the onginel

1 am a kavanyo student
based in windhock and
would like to express my
concern about the ongoing
banditry activities in my
region. i have seen that the
crists situation in the
kavangois going from bad
to worsc.

government's reaction
towards this problem ts a
complete nddle to me.
what is the use of just sit-
ting in luxurious offices,
peacefully and quietly,
while life is really a living
hell in the kavango. the
government should rather
find a solution to this mat-
ter, instead of just saying it
is the people of the
kavango themselves who
are collaborating with
unita.

let’s come to a reason-

-able solution - instead of

wasting our tme on re-

aa _ ~

eruminauions against cach
other. this situauon where
kavangos cannot even
enjoy the basic pleasure of
peace, progress, prosper-
ity and stability should not
conunue like this. [feel we

bian soil. zambia has done
it, why not namibia too?
one thing the govern-
ment should be aware of is
that unita’s banditry ac-
vities are always oncnn
and this will discourage
more tounsts trom com-
ing to namibia. so we will
lose anyway, as our coun-
try’s economy depends on
tounsm and this is reason
enough for foreign busi-
ness people not to invest
their shares in namibia,
especially the kavango.
some of the schools in
the kavango, like max

makushe secondary
school, fans shastipapa
and others won't have
physical science or math-
ematcs teachers. the yol-
unteer teachers won't be
interested in applying to
these schools due to the
unstable situation in the
kavanyvo. in this way the
economy and academe
issucs will vradually be
aftected ;

so the government
should not yust stand by.
must do someting - de-
mand the total withdrawal
of the mpla trom the
kavaneo

unita bandutry activities
should not only be

kavangoconcems, butthe

whole of namibia as ‘one

nanubia, one nation’.

florida county laws were applicable
to the recount ‘reument during the
election court proceedings and not
perhaps the national constitution
that] presumed could have been the
document that could resolve the elec-
tiondtlemma experienced. as well as
duplication, disparities and contra
dictions between what the voters did
and what the electoral college does.
during the election proceedings in
the florida supreme court. | recall
one judge was reported as saying the
us election 2000 fiasco was caused
by people who did not follow young
instructions. this can be an ambigu-
ous or explicit statement, was it due
to the illiteracy of the voters or the
complication of ballot papers as al-
leged by the democrats? prom my

observation people are attributing it
to illiteracy.

according to that judge's state-
ment, it 1s overt thal the voter's illit-
eracy impelled/incited the whole
election process/ballot counting to
be referred to the court for a verdict.
‘toe same sentiments/ views were
also teverberated/repeated by our
prime minister when he addressed a
swapo by-election rally at rundu
this week and he said: “we know
how to count, we are not hke the
u.s”. obviously this botls down to
illiteracy again.

conversely, was justice done or
was the citizen's will, voting rights
and voice respected when a clan of
judges took a decision on behalf of

such clecaons which were loo close

with regard to the change of us

tration. africa should clarify its pri-
orities and right from the beginning
operate on business principles/terms
with the bush administration.

finally, voter education should be
made a priority by political parties/
electoral commissions to ensure a
fair and just victory by political par-
ties in the elections.

Peace.20010907_page_1.txt,Tsumeb Windhoek,"ten reasons why cap

allow me to clear up
and elaborate on what has

' become a controversial

hot potato on the name

, change for capnvi.

who was caprivi to
start with? caprivt was a
german cuptain in the
german colonial army.
shortly betore they were
defeated by the british
and the south afmean
forees, captain capris
and his torces quickls
decided in that short ses-
sion held at then head-
quarters: schuckmianns
burg (o naine the region
caprivi in addition of the
existing henge name

this was decided ta
have a two-fold connota-
tion. firstly as a landmark
that clearly states that the
entire namibia was calo-
mised by germany. see:
ondly. wath the name
capri intact it was casy

for germany to reclaim
the entire country back
after the war and review
allsigned agreements with
britain.

a name change for
caprivi is long overdue;
was supposed to change
subsequently after rade-
pendenee in 1990.
change is inevitable and
we cannotrun away from
it

why the name change?

1 the name capris a has
fink

namibiins residing inthe

no cultural wath

rerton vig nbasubats,
mates. mavosis and the
san people

2. caprivicuts short the
history of  muatwes.
masubias, masyeyis and
the san people whose his:
tors voosastarasthe sth
centuts

sthe scrambling of
aftcan history teaches us

that most afneans come
from the great lakes
where the name capnvi
never existed, hence it
only came alive in 1915.
(note: languages existed
before the name capny1)

4 the naine capnvidis-
eriminates hence all
nanubians residing there
cannot be called
caprivian.onty those bom
there (note. capris its not
a language buta german
name }

s.the name capris
promotes rebellion and
scecssionistd stee 1h an
plies

namibrans hat]
from that revion are trom
a country other than the

wha

land ot the brave.

6 caprivt assumes the
status of adifferent coun:
try. hence itis the only
napubien region that sub-
juates chezens, viz. we

rivi should get a new name

don't have omahekeans.
ohangwenians nor
khomasians, why
caprivians?

7 -caprivi should notbe
compared to cities and
towns lke windhoek and
tsumeb which exphertls
teflect their ongin by
mame. it is subject to
change without vote or
referendum to suit the pre-
valhng changes and de-
velopment. so as te bring
about peace in the coun:
ty. remember itis one ot
the most troublesome re:

gions in the county.

8 the name capnivihas
nothing in common with
namibian people.

9.the name caprivi
could have been a con-
tributing factor to the past
and ongoing tribal con-
tlictin the region. nobody
really knows its real mean-
ing. tm aware the new
name may not make
katima mulito clean

1) caprivi is the only
namibian region, which
has
no hustoncal background

is not indizenous -

with its people.

the mame praises
caprivi and his father
zipfel and indeed the en-
tire german people as he-
roes and will continue to
haunt us as long as it ex-
ists,

having said that, my
choice of name 1s zam-
bez1 region. itis neutral,
unpartialandis namibia's
major tourist attraction
nearly everyone drinks
water from (the river). we
all five trom at eather di-

rectly oor indirectly

through its fish inthis way
we willremain namibians
and will never be
‘zambezians .

note: contrary to your
version of how caprivi
got us name, the strip of
land was named after
german chancellor
count von caprivt. let-
ter writers should please

rect.- kd

mn sour highly esteemed
paper to comment on
america snew war. bam
very concerned about re-
ports that peaple are tlee-
ing atghanistan i the
wake of tears of a possi
ble us attacks on alleved
terrorist bases.

followime the ataeks
on american interests im
new york and washing-
ton it is not surprising
that the us propaganda
machinery made this the
wworst-ever story reported
sotarin america, the us
medra did not give acom-
plete and in depth cover-
ave when innocents peo-
ple where massacred by
us torces in’ vietnam or
in the gulf war to name
but a few,

its sad that inocent
people died in this attacks
but lyust wonder whether
the lives of americans are

the namibian

america must not wage war

worth more than the lives
of afehaas, sudanese. vie
etnamese and other states
where people have been
atacked by us forces.
american presidents
should have remembered
that “what goes around
is it not
ahvays mnocent people
who die when “hig” men
are fighting’? just like
those who are going to die
when afghanistan is at
tacked? the world should
wake up to the realities at
hand. the us iself was
labelled a terrorist state in
the past and uo ts exactly
what they are.
remember what hap-
pened with patnee
lumumba and the war of
the bay of pigs in cuba?

comes ground”

thes are using pakistan
andthe ssimpathy of other
countries to launch a full
seule attack on a sover-
elem county

j yust wonder where the
sympathy of the world
was when tnnocent peo-
ple diced in missile attacks
by us ftorees on the order
of tormer us president
bill choton in sudan af-
ter the bombing of the us
embassy in kenya and
elsewhere? [it shows the
hypocrisy of these coun-
tries that are supporting
the united states in this
new war. one should also
look at the hypocnsy of
the pakistan ruler who
came to power by over-
throwing the former gov-
ernimentand its leader. he

is busine face wath the
usa and tts athes at the
expense of hts own peo-
ple.

this new war is a res-
elation that the united
states ts an aggressive
state and retabation will
not stop but intensify ter-
roristacuivities asainstthe
us.

how can there be peace
in the world tfonly a teow
countries are living in
complete wealth at the
expense of the rest of the
world? tm really ques-
toning this new war ides.
what makes us intelh-
pence sure that these at-
tacks have been master-
minded by saudi exile.
osama bin laden? there
are many suspects in this

case, juse to mame a few
countries that showed an
anti us stance such as
iraq. yemen. libya,cuba.
palestine and many oth:
ets.

the us has tatted: tor
more than fout veurs to
arrest bin laden, a clear
sign of the weakness of
the us seecunty, intel
gence and defence organs
against internagonal: ter-
rorisny. freally think that
they are abusing the sym-
pathy of the world to at-

tack a sovereign state if

bin laden is not handed
over.

the attacks on the pen-
tagon and the twin tow-
ers of the world trade
center is a clear indica-
tion that the attucks were

aimed at wheat is repre:
sented by these buridings
rather than che mnocent

that the pentagon repre:

capitalism, colosatism
and other negatiye vices
which ws still repressing

bad enough without the photo

thank you for your services and for
“sull telling it hike it is"", despite some
people who only like you doing that
when it is in their favour. but today’s
front page (wednesday january 30)
is beyond the limits of what we need to
know. in other words: the picture on
today’s front page is below your level
of journalism and nears your paper to
the low level the windhoek observer,
which i stopped buying when it pub-
lished the picture of the french chil-
dren that were murdered on the caprivi-
highway some years ago.
if i read in an article that a young man
killed his grandmother for n$soo in

cash than this is bad enough. if i then
have to read that he used an axe, it is
more than enough. how should my
level of information be enhanced by
seeing the picture? instead i would
rather like to know how a person can go
so far, better. how can a young person
lose his human and social values to
such an extent? what do the neigh-
bours and relatives say? how do they
think that they (and us) can prevent
such gruesome crimes in future?
why are these kinds of crimes so much
increasing nowadays? how did people
deal with them traditionally? etc. it is
this kind of question i would rather be

interested in than seeing a dead kuku

with an axe in her head. peace to her

soul. | am also concemed about the

feelings of the family of the victim and

the culpnt not to menuon all the other
people like desperate youngsters who
sec this picture. why do they need to be
exposed to such atrocities? do you
expect to sell more newspapers when
they have such pictures on the front
page? please keep the quality level we
are used to from your paper and leave the
cheap and sensationalist journalism to
people who don’t know better.

1 don’t know who has
both authority and wis-

such as: is peace in sight

finest, credible and most
able political analysts,
diplomats and politicians
based in the region and
outside the region are, of
much help to guide and

rather than previously.
and it can be said with
certainty that to let the

out bringing peace to

shortsighted on the side
of those involved in the
peace . it would
be difficult to do so in the

much needed foreign in-

some of the burden which

for that reason let peace

prevail over war, let
peace rise above all dif-
ferences and ultimatcly
reign supreme in the re-

when headmen march on 4th term

the recent marching of swapo kings and head-
men is a wrong move. it’s a pity that our people,
when they are in numbers sup the same
idea, think they are right. they think that means
“one namibia, one nation”. what we must think
of is what the fourth term means for us as namibian
nation, not to make one man happy. what is the
extent of its advantages and disadvantages? the
fourth term is costly. it will lead to more hunger
and poverty. peace can never be maintained by an
individual human being, unless it is deserved by
all.

the demanded referendum is an additional
election. where will the millions of dollars come
from? will the nation be sacrificed again for an
individual advantage and benefit? are we really
serious? to change the constitution to allow a
fourth term means money (millions). this burden
will be put on the already suffering namibian
shoulders. hearing the government has

and hence we have a very limited inte; a sto the

the money will be misspent as we still have a
high unemployment rate in the country and those
in the recent youth service scheme from
grootfontein could be employed. or is it swapo
party that will fund the referendum?

the extent of love within a human being is the
same as hatred. chiluba in zambia is an example
of the peoples’ turning point from love to hatred.
next, the same people who are chanting. “we did
not sleep, we want sem blah, blah”. they will
call for prosecution after they discovered the dis-
respect of our country’s constitution by him and
the misuse of our country’s limited resources for
individual benefit. which reasons will they give
and what difference will they make between the
current president and his successor who will be
demanding a third and fourth term? he will also
be liked and supported by a majority like netson
mandela and bil) clinton. it is the same type of
people who will march again then.

bush sr. headed the first part and now
we are again to see the other bush tying
to continue where his father left off. go-
ing to war_with iraq will not be the
answer, it will only destabilize the peace
in the muslim world. is there any con-
crete proof that can implicate saddam
hussein in producing weapons of mass
destruction’ if there is not enough proof,
why is that the us is concerned with
going to war with iraq?

i feel that we will pot be able to enjoy
peace even for one yeas, because the

is there not any single soluuon, which

can prevent the innocent people from

what about the united nations? is not the

be a threat to anyone? if we live in peace
and work for acommon goal, which 1s to
alleviate poverty and find the cure of
aids, wecan live better, instead of send-
ing millions of dollars in weapons, which
can destroy and kill people, we can use
that money to good use.

a pain for the youth

[ wilt. always be saluting the patron-
age of this widely read and informative
newspaper. the nanubian newspaper
sull has the monopoly in terms of good
reporting both dunng the colonsal and
post colonial period - its still reporting
things as they are.

the aforementioned statement can-
not be defeated by any useful and re-
sponsible nammbian citizen. the gov-
ermment does things without looking at
the mmpheations associated with its ac-
tions. one would always wonder 1f the
top government officials, including the
president, have advisors at all. being

unemployed, we the youth of this nation
learnt with dismay of the government
ban from advertising inthe namibran. it
is very expensive for us job seekers to
buy both the new eraand the namibran
at the same time. if the government 1s
shameful to come back to the namibian
itmust establish a free of charge weekly
paper where we can get the govemment
job adverts. otherwise there will be no
need to campaign for the next electcns
nor hark about peace and stahility.

right wing afrikaners, take note!

tread with shock and dismay in the namibian of
november 12 about the activities of the so called
‘boer nation warriors’. i want to express my views.

ido not know whether the “boerevolk krygers”
elements are also present in namibia, but if there are
such members or those who are aspiring to such
ideas, keep such ideas dormant infinitely. it is
friendly advice.

i am very concerned about this terrorist move-
ment causing havoc tn south africa with its result-
ant destruction and disregard for human life and
property. this movement, although it has been in
existence for years, has surely come at the wrong
time. those conservative, radical boers must know
that they do not live in utopia whereby theywant to”
promote the ideology of aryan nationalism. they
must learn to live with diversity. we are all people
of different colours and that we have to live side by
side. no one ts superior or inferior to the other. to

be bad 1s not an inherent character, it ts a learned
habit due to the environment in which one is raised.
anyone can be bad.

criminality is not confined toa specific race. no!
itis part of human existence and under certain social

circumstances and living conditions anyone is a

potential criminal.
this reminds me of what mr hannes smith (edi-

tor of windhoek observer) once wrote. i quote. ‘no
man/woman ts born a criminal. criminals are made
by conditions, environmental factors, to say noth-
ing of social conditions”. how true are those words
from an open-minded person.

those who are aiming to wipe out the black nation
(in case of soweto) must know that the black man
can act in the same way. does it sound inciteful or
a threat (o you? maybe, but not to me. together we
can make or break this world.

nine bombs in all were enough to take away many
innocent lives.

when one’s livelihood is threatened. you invent
ways to counteract in order to protect yourself to
survive. let us live in peace rather than war. war ts
bad so let us avoid racial hatred since we did not
choose who we are. let us find lasting pragmatic
solutions that would see us through to the next
development level. life was meant to be lived by

all. no one has a patent on life.

we read with shock and dismay the
artcle by the “brave” but nameless
‘editorial staff members’ of namibia
today. this article is an unambiguous
declaranon of war by this newsletter
and i am ready to enter the battle
whatever the consequences.

the so-called wrong platform: the
memonal service took place in the
ephesians congregation of the evan.
gelical lutheran church in the repub-
lic of namibia and for the information
of the ""editorial staff members’ | am
the bishop of that church. thus, i
used my own platform.

the late comrade hilukilwa
kandanga was a member of my
church. she was not only a heroine,
but also a true namibian who did not
only condemn tnbalism with her words

\

1 .

bot also very much with ber ows life.

therefore, the timing of what i said
was correct, and within the right con-
text. it is also obvious that i woald not
ask permission from namibia today,
of anyone clse, for what i said on my
own platform!

my so-called attach on swapo: at
no stage dunng my serman did i men-
uon the swapo party or any tibe. i was
also not exclusive in what i said, but
very inclusive. i called on all of us, the
former oppressed namibians, to also
look at ourselves and to correct whatis
wrong with us. the ‘editorial staff
members” accuse me of lies but they
are shameless when they fabricate what
i did not say.

i thank the right honourable prime

and cormupton in public and pot be-
hind closed doors “at the nght place,
and had it handled in line with the
culture and long established practice
of debate and mature discussions that
prevails in the swapo party”.

does this by implication mean that
the statements of the president and
prime minister on these issues are
outbursts and tibal antics and are also
regarded by namibia today as outra-
geous, despicable, and wild? this is
indeed the conclusion of all nght-think-

happy about fourth term cam

the lingering debate and pos-
tunng by politcal pundits, tra-
ditional leadership, the ordi-

nary ciuzens and ‘outsiders’
about the need or not for presi-
dent nujomato run for another
term, the so called ‘fourth
term’ as head of state, can be
likened to a rhinoceros, which
looks different depending on
where the observer is standing
and what portion of its anatomy
he/she 1s concentrating on.
each perspecuve has some par-
ucular insights andeachis only
a part of the whole!

as an ordinary namibian
ciazen from the caprivi re-
gion, i am therefore delighted
to hear of yet another concerted
and well-orchestrated cam-
paign to convince and/or urge
our president to seek another
term.

there 1s an american say-
ing, “ifitain’tbroken, don't fix
10"". my position is simple and
groes something like thts: the
inconclusive leadership transt-
tion (no domestic pun intended
since mostof the senior leaders
in the party and government
are seasoned, tested and com-
petent) that the recently held
swapo congress produced,
raises important questions
about who will really be in
command should president
nujoma step down after the
expiry of his current term.

while iam a breat believer
in ‘collective leadership’ (it’s
casy if you are one of the cho-
sen ones), i suppose i’ve be-
come disillusioned with poli-
tics - and i think most
namibians have become disil-
lusioned with poliucians too.

an intellectual friend of
mine once commented,
“namibians don't want to ac.
cepl excuses any more - if
there’s moncy tobe stolen, why
isn’t there money for the peo-
ple?” it would appear we sull
don't have our pnorities nghte.

once upon a time i was al-
ways fixing everyone else's
problems, but not my own and
guess where it landed me?
what has all this to do with the
fourth term, you may ask?

despite a mosaic of tnbula-
uons and misplaced pnonities,
every day i ask the question:
‘can president sam nujoma
do no wrong?” the answer is
an emphatic no.

namibians love him above
all other ministers and even
the feeble and weak opposi-
tion grudgingly admires his

poltucal talent. at his age,
president nuyoma has lostnone
of his charisma he had in exile
and ts a man of al} seasons
liked by all namuibians from
any comer of this great nation
of ours.

perhaps the breatest asset
credited to president nuyoma
is zood governance.

since independence on 21
march 1990 delivered high lev-
els of security, provided qual-
ity educaton and health serv.
ices, respected political
freedoms and human nghts,
framed a strong rule of law,
bolstered an economic frame-
work conducive to growth and
has provided an environment
in which civil society can flour-
ish.

hence, there 1s a direct cor-
relauon between good national

bovernance and economic
prospenty

ordinary namibians havea
mght to expect a better life af-
ter all the sacnfices they en-
dured during the liberation
struggle. people do not fight
for ideas but for peace, mate-
nal benefits anda better future
for their children.

the majority of namibians’
€xpectauons of independence,
namely, their sincere hope that
freedom from colonial tule
would usher in a new era of
basic rights and freedoms long
denied by settler rule. this 1s
what the liberation struggle
meant for ordinary namibians.
president sam nujomais there-
fore an embodiment of the
aforementioned ideals.

the big question for pres-
dent nujyoma, therefore, is not

paign

as much opposition from ann-
chair critics from the west,
amateur poliucians of ‘op
siuon parties’ but the envy of
his own colleagues, some of
whom have bowed out due to
their politcal naivete.

president nuyoma has one
tule he says something each
day and in such a manner that
it becomes the talk of the na-
tion he 1s therefore in the spor-
light most of the ume - all of
which impresses the namibian
voters and makes his fellow
politicians seethe with jeal-
ousy

how detilitaung then tocnt-

of force as an instrument of policy
and diplomacy has become wide-
spread, the balance between peace
and war has become even more
precanous. where is this leading?
the united nations wamed: “we
are penlously near to a new inter-
nabonal anarchy “.

is there any reason to believe
that men can bring an end to war?
histoncally, there have been only
a few scattered years when this

fray mac 28 2008 15
ckle big problems

carth was totally free from

war. in the 20th century alone,
about 100 million people have
been killed in war, neither yester-
day’s league of nations nor to-
day’s united nations has been
able to stop this slaughter. but
won't the fear of nuclear weap-
ons change this? wasn't suffi-
cient fear of nuclear weapons
aroused back in 1945 when atom
bombs annihilated two japanese
clues? since then stockpiles of
vastly more powerful nuclear
weapons have grown a thousand-
fold. and since 1945 many. many
people have been killed in wars
and rebellions involving more
than 100 countnes.

in recent years more than 45
nauons were involved in con-

flicts, no fear of nuclear weap-
ons has and wi] ttop the war.
granted nations do and continue
to sign disarmament pacts or trea.
ves. over the century isterally
more then thousands of these
have been signed yet, when-
cver war sentiments became
strong enough. those meanes be-
come worthless scraps of paper
the united nations has also
failed to stop war, because al-
though nearly all the counties
today are part of the un, they
ignore tat will so we hope that
future world leaders will keep
their word more than they have
done in the past

ss you

for an| the world climate is a volatile one as we rapidly
ysolve | approach a future of uncertainty in world politics.
yan by | because of the recent violence abroad concocted in the
*k for- | war waged against iraq, just like other countries it is
d your | time for namibians to organise visible resistance to
you be | this war and all forces that are threatening the peace of

vation | a world we have responsibility to.
tion of | this is acall to action for namibians. a broad base of

support must be gathered out of the namibian commu-
nity, and it will take the work of cach and every
namibian to get this off the ground. we need a broad
enced | base support that honours each person's unique com-

urag- | in, and stand strong.
we will need a variety of assets to make this work.

y,the | fromschoolteachers to workers and artists, to students
ejoy| and organisers, we must realise the urgency of this
your] situation and the deep necessity to resist.
not this movement must be sustainable, and therefore
|his| we must do it well with high energy and undying
year | commitment. even after the bombing stops in iraq, the
violent crisis will not be over, and the nature of war is
hes | that the aftermath effects everyone. war perpetuates
de-| and amplifies already dire situations like starvation,
we | sanctions, community destruction, continued tension
in| and loss of live. these are only a few casualties of war.
as no country, including namibia, will go unaffected
| economically, socially and politically by the war in
a iraq. we must organise each other to participate in the

i worldwide effort to handle the aftermath an’ be pop
f! future violence. fellow namibians, us get on board
d and fight hard for a just peace bere and throughout the

world!

all i can say is thank god the
namubian didn’t accept batfour
ankomah’s challenge to reprint
his entire lecture in full. pm allin
favour of fantasy fiction but after
reading baffour’s lengthy,
obscenely self satistied and
patronisingly racist letter in the
namibian (not to mention
watching him in person blathering
away on talk of the nation), pd
have to say that namibia has
suffered enough,

begone, batfour! go back to
your cruel exile in) your
comfortable london flat with its
potholed road (not to mention
fancy restaurants, political
security and snappy boutiques)!

or better sal, if you think that
potholes are a serious indictment

of western values, cut the poor
british some slack, hop ona plane
and leave them 1n peace as well.

take your mercenary little rag
of a magazine with you. open a
newspaper office in zimbabwe,
perhaps.

i hear there’s one currently
vacant in harare and you've got
the zanu-pf government line
down pat. lassume thatmugabe’s
people pay you. or at the very
least fly you around showering
you with free hotel rooms and
bodyguards. baffy, my little
exiled buddy, tell me i’m wrong!
can't. can you?

one final suggestion.

how about returning to your
native ghana? you can’t still be
inexile surely? not after all these

years? not when you love africa
so much and know so much about
this great continent. not after all
the political change that has taken
place in ghana? and you, batfy,
stl in exile?

or perhaps you are. given your
morbidly turgid prose, your
depressing dictatorial arrogance,
your inability to write a simple
letter without giving a moderate
newspaper reader (me) dyspepsia,
and the sheer lunacy of your stance
onissues suchas hiv-aids, how
wonderful it ts to live under
mugabe, and the evils of press
freedom, perhaps you are.

yes, perhaps you are.

ising inachureh chotr here in the north of italy and
also with a small jazz band which generally makes ten
or wwelve public appearances a year.

i sincerely feel that the victory choir should have
more opportunity to appear in public. both to let
people see how good they are and also as a way of
vetting funds tor their very important project

i would suggest that they could sing at the atrport to
welcome international delegates arriving for meet
ings and congresses and at the larger hotels. like the
kalahan) sands. the safar court and the country
club resort and casino, where | feel sure that foreign
visitors would enjoy their performance.

i know the choir would have transport problems to
get to the hotels, but | imagine that the hotels them-
selves would be able to arange that aspect of things.

[ would be most grateful if your newspaper could
print all or part of my letter and am also sending

conscience and god-
consciousness. as oa

speeches, please!

namibian voters havea right to be informed inorder
to cast their votes with commitment and maturity as
far as their future is concerned. [tis in that context that
we - again - request “leaders” to stick to the rules of
democracy and free and fair elections.

mr. tyirtange, your previous position as minister of
justice should have instilled a respect for the namibian
constitution in you. that should at least reach as far as
knowing that it is not swapo that created the
namibian defence force, police, civil service etc. etc.
- that is an obligation every government of a country
has.

swapo is just another political party and not the
government. sic - we do not live in 1960 anymore - the
year 2044 1s here and we have and want to move on.

we all have an understanding that you might still
fee! bitter about your past - let us, however, look ahead
and rather work for a future that does not bring back
those years. namibia has so many problems that need
tangible solutions. solutions will not be found by clinging
on to the past and asking weird questions hke: “what
did ben ulenga tell the boers to be released?”

absurd statements like “the cod has been created
by colontalists”.

by the way, sir, the cod is a legitimate political
party and not an organisation. you can condemn the
“colonisers” till eternity - as fong as you, the swapo
party, still depend on them for food assistance for
namibians your statements boomerang.

tell the voters why is it necessary to apply for n$37.7
million donor assistance to feed namibians?

teli the voters why only foreigners get major building
contracts these days?

tell the voters why they - after 14 years of
mdependence - stul live in shacks and shambles?

why is almost every municipality bankrupt in
nambia? .

why is each and every parastatal costing the
namibian taxpayers milhons and millions?

sir -yvouas former minister of justice - should cry out
loud: babies and toddlers are raped on a daily basis.
criminals rule the country - namibtans get murdered
for a few dollars - corruption never gets punished.

the hist, lam afraid, is endless! the police force ts ill
equipped. ill-trained - why would windhock otherwise
ask for a municipal police force?

the namibian defence force - whois insane enough
to want to attack namibia - nambia does not need that
force. the money could be spent on housing/educations
health services etc. etc. all these and many more
pressing issues and what can be done about it.

that makes up election material for many months —
sir-notyour defamations and agitating hate speeches.

howeser-af your attacks on the cod are an indicator
to vo by - the cob is doing a good job and giving you
ample reason to see an opposition in that party,

mr tjitianye, please come up with solutions for
namibians since we all know that the tax pavers — and
thatincludes opposition party members - pay for swapo
rallies

we have peace in namibia - thatis also a credit co
opposition partes since we can argue in parliament
and don't hase to take up weapons - lets keep it that
way. please. and let's tackle namibia's multuple
problems toxether.

allow me some space, please.
to remind some of your readers
that before they write about any
conflict around the globe and the
people involved init, todo some
research first on particular mat-
ters and to have a more realistic
approach.

a letter ta the namibian
- ‘condemn the killers” - 1s an
example where the writer show s
his total ignorance about the
situation inthe middle eastand
us people

the writer claims that pales-
tinians are forergners inthe hols
land and should be expelled by
the israclis in order to achieve
everlasting peace, he also writes
that palestinians are not men-
uoned in phe bible or recorded
bs historians. in the letter he
cniucised european union gov -
eramems for condemning the
ussassinauon of hamas leader
yassin by psraclis.

this isn’t the place for me
to write about the 10 000-year
long history of these (vo great
nations which contributed so
much to world cultures in terms
of many discoveries, writings

and science. my sole objective
1s lo correcl mispercepuions on
this particular issue

the fact is that the arabs
and the jews believe that they
descend from the same father
- abraham. no-one is sure who
came firsttothe holy land his-
tory only tells us that palestine
was first peopled by wandering
stone age hunters and that per-
manent agricultural settlement
appeared at jericho about 8000
b.c) according to historical
claims hebrew (jews) tribes
arrived from the desert in pales-
tine between the [4th and }2th
century boc.and that roughly
the sume time the philistines
invaded trom the sea,

the name palestine is in fact
anadaptation troma greek word
“the land of philistines” and the
name ismentioned many times in
the bible. first book gen 21:34
“abraham lived in philestia for
along me”.

just for the record | would
like to mention that in 1918 the
palestine population consisted
of 500 000 muslim arabs, 100
000 arab christians and 60 000

jews.

at the time of the 1948 war,
more than 500 000 palestinians
fled from their country to seck
refuge with arab neighbours tn
every arab country where thes
landed, they were treated as
second-class citizens, confined
to ghettos specially created for
them

why eu governments con-
demn the killing of hamas
leader mr yassinis because thes
believe that the assassination of
political leaders promotes more
violence and does not provide
a solution for either sides. not
long ago, swapo was just like
hamas, on american terrorist
lists,andevervbody wouldugzree
with me that assussmation of its
president, sam nujoma, by the
former south african whtte re-
gime, would only have destroy ed
the relauionstip between blacks
and whttes and caused more ha-
tred; but would ulmately never
have prevented namibia from
becoming independent

Peace.20040604a_page_1.txt,Swakopmund,"were the elections free and fair?

elections would be fairif those who vote elected
their representatives freely without any pressure or
any form of intimidation or character assassination?
i strongly feel that (the swapo congress) elections
were not free and fair.

the sacking ofoursistonary, capable hamutenya
just before elections and smear campatens against
him by nujoma on several occasions will never
make this election free and fair.

i would notexpect any rational person to belies ¢
what has been said about hamutenya by those who
did so, including the president.

we expected the president to tell the natlon and
the congress in particular that these are tested
comrades and the every body should make his/her
own choice accordingly.

he ts now claiming that the congress has voted
in the interest of the whole nation. this ts totally
wrong. the congress has voted for nujoma’s un-
known interests.

if the entire nation was afforded a chance to
elect, | think the results could have been different.
the fact that pohamba came with a pre-prepared
speech for the victory shows us that the results
were predetermined and the transparency used in
the counting processes is questionable.

we considered sam nujyomaas the greatfounding
father of our natron and indeed a visionary leader

of africa but this was not so. nujoma ts increas-
inely becoming a hardcore despot. he thinks he can
turn things around, ceteris paribus. firing senior
ministers and indeed cabinet members who served
for decades ts a big embarrassment to him and to
the public.

does this mean swapo party does not have iter
nal disciplinary procedures to deal with unfounded
defaming allegations’? he keeps on referring to
others as imperiatists and forgets that he went to
the same imperialists to negotiate for namibia's
independence.

his prerogative is beigg seriously misused. some
ministers are so much preferred that firing them
would destabilise the country’s peace and stabilits
and dissolve the gains of our hard-won mdepend-
ence. this is also a sign that swapo ts slowly but
surely disintegrating.

i think this was the wrong decision at the wrong
time. all the peace loving namibians (perhaps ex-
cluding despots, opportunists, presidential remote
controls, political armatures, and power-hungry
hereby sympathise with hamutens aand his deputy
we are already missing his intellectual leadership

squandering of government money,
moneys which could have been put
to use somewhere else tn omy
view, this kind of practice will in
the long rug gadermine the govern
ment and

therefore to deter thr,

kind of spending of public funds
rn future. somebods must be made
accountable for this shamreiul
blunder

hovou want me to believe other
wise convince me thatthe decision
to purchase the plane 1a question
was based on screnlitie investiga:
tions the results of which were
posive. and therefore the current
hinancrdaberisis is nota resullot poor
planning. phe questronis. have we

Peace.20040720_page_1.txt,,"down with hate speech

prompted by the publication of
“instances of hate speech” by the national
societ) of human rights tin our media
allow me to pass some comments, and
e\press my personal opinion on this very
sctious issue.

} don’t think it would be necessary to
write or explain more about the grave
consequences of hate speech. its all
well known and documented in places
like bosnia tthe country of my births and
rwanda

phave to mention that for many vears |
used to live under to, which pwould call
“evil systems). being communism and
apartheid respectively,

howeveresil the 40 were. none of the
two allowed hate speech to be directed
towards other nationalities orraces: under

the communists, hate speech even heavily
puntshable by the law.

here in namibia where the building of
“one namibia one nation” and reconcill-
ation should be the priorities for the sake
of peace and stability.

we have destructive clements amony
the democratically elected publie figures,
like some government officials and upton
leaders. who ure by their speeches finding
it very difficull to connect ther mouths
with their brains

what makes matters even worse. (heir
speeches are broadcasted, over and over,
momost of our spoken languages

even winning by 99% of votes, no
government can cham: for ttself to be
transparent and democratic it it allows
the nghts of minorities to be disrespected

and violated.

however, nbc and other instigators of
racial hatred in our society didn tachieve
anything so far and hopetully this will be
so in the future tas a white namibian,
ean stl walk freely tn-any of the “black
residential areas without fear of rachal
mou ated allacks.

it namibian fallen heroes, who died tor
a mulliracial society and justice im this
country, could now hear whatcomes outed
the mouths of rapendaand rapia. believe
me. thes would turn in there graves.

my sincere congratulation goes to all
peace loving namibians on their shown
maturity and tolerance.

Peace.20040806_page_1.txt,,"on ‘uninformed’ opinions

ihopethistime my letter will ap-
pear, unlike the other vo or three
cases when you (unintentionally )
omitted them. ewill copy itto the
other media, just in case.

i read the rather confusing, tf
not uninformed, opinion of nadia
ihuhua, where she was dissatis-
fied with uutont nujoma’s pres-
entation to the chr in geneva,
regarding the case of the caprivi
secessionists.

well, nadia. like any other
namubian, you have a right to air
your opinton as you did, so let me
do the same as follows:

how informed are you if you
label cde. paulus kapia as one
of the “government officials”?
when last we checked cde. ka-
pia was a party official. nadia
rightly alluded to the need for us
to have “responsible and trans-
parent leaders who know what
isimportantand what constitutes

human-centred

development” she ts right but
which humans are being referred
to? tome. only leaders to the con-
trary will allow sucha vision to be
derailed by a tew elements

such as muyongo and his
cohorts.

after all when we talk of hu-
man-centered development dont
we mean the people with a sense
of purpose, thatof sustainable de-
velopment, like the ones we have?
or, dowe mean the detractors, ms
ihuhua? surely we do not mean
to spend all the scant resources
on the rights of the detractors
rather than on the pensions of our
elderly or hiv-aids patients?
do you really think if we spend
millions of $ this case, we will
elevate our human rights record
internationally?

what about the right to five in
peace, the right to food. the right

live without fear ete? what kind
of agenda do vou sant to set for
us. mnocent ciaizens?

thenagain, since vou are inv it
ing people to go to the launching
of the nshr report, then | guess
i(andevervone else} know where
you are coming from. good luck
with thatevent, but for the rest of
us, we prefer democracy, which
is the government by the people
(majority ) for the people, and of
the people.

ifyou really have the future of
our country at heart, please stop
bering phony and be a namibian
the few people you are talking
about want their own country.

they will have therrfairchance
under our laws. the question is,
are they with republic of namibia
or with their dream republic?

mibian, | would like to
give my opinion on out
democracy.

i would tke to start
with giving my advice and
views to our democrau-
cally elected representa-
lives those are voting to
be nominated and those
who are representing us
now, more especially
members of parhament
(national assembly and
national council). some
of our representatives do
not truly represent us.
because we, cilizens often

do not nomunate them in
the urst place. they are
representing thetr respec-
tive political party leader-
ship. representatives who
have been sonominated by
their leaders, once elected
to office as parhamen-
tarians and councillors,
become subservient to
these leaders. instead of
this representative being
accountable to the voters
they are only responsible
and accountable to their
political leaders who nom-
mated them. and who also
have the power lo remove

them. therefore such
representauves strive to
please their leaders often
in patron-chent relation:
ships. such relationships
are often maintained atthe
expense of the voters and
the general public. this ts
why once in their office,
most parliamentarians
and councillors may not
do what the public expects
them to do.

i know that these rep-
resentauves are not really
representing us because
cilizens are not the ones
who nominate them,

awe alcl ss oe a law

what! want toemphasis
is that: p can see that the
top-down appointment
of candidates is not a
vood way to go. voters

have to nominate their

own representatives. such
representauves nominated
by the voters themselves
know the needs of citi-
gens better than imposed
candidates do. voters also
nominate a person who
they know and who they
trust. this system of the
top-down tashion of nomi-
nation must be stopped
and bottom- up fashion
must be introduced in the
political parties. | know
if we do this, our country

will be a good example to
other countries. further-
more ouf representauves
will be accountable to all
ciuzens. the representa-
tives nominated by voters
themselves will work in
the interest of their voters
and not in interest of their
political leaders. because
they know that hf they

est of their voters in the
