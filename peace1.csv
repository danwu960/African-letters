| WEEP FOR MY COUNTRY,
which has been conquered by
force, and in which oppression and
immorality reigns supreme. The
country in which people have lost
their human dignity, the country
where we are nov treated like
foreigners ...

if anyone enjoys a bit of luck or
finds himself a little better off, im-
mediately his heart grows hard. In
our time people who think only of
themselves are wicked.

No one knows my despair, save
He who knows ail, but my heart is
in a perpetual state of anguish.

Our oppressors should know
that Namibians are not brain-
washed and we will never be blind-
folded. Justbecause we smile and
smile, and happiness is our coat,
they think we are gateposts, numb
to the stab of pain.

Just because of the laughter on-

our lips and our eyes lowered in
respect, you think we are like

stones.

This is our fatherland which has
been pillaged by foreign con-
querors who have exploited and
grown rich on the spoils of our
nation.

Itis time to abolish apartheid. Let
our brothers in South Africa enjoy
peace, equality, freedom and
justice.

Let the world know our problems,
and let us share our problems with
them. Let us demand the im-
plementation of Resolution 435, so
that victory for Namibia will be

press my views with regard tothe

Namibia has become a politi-
cal object of the international im-

we get rid of them.

progressives in this country to
maintain and tighten the existing
cooperation among us, which
will lead to political unity.

We have a common identity

Can only solve when we are polit-
leafly united.

Let us stop demanding minor
reforms like open hotels and
bers, and instead strive for total

and national Indepen-
dence of the Namibian people.

Let us also distance ourselves
trom our various political ideol-

ogles. Wecan pursue these after
Independence.

The South African Govern-
ment has embarked on a strate-
gy Of political intolerance and the
suppression of any opposition
from progressives. In order to
counter this, we have to combine
forces so that they give the
government to the peopte.

Let us unite in order to force
South Africa to relinquish her
colonial positionin Namibia. Our
compatriots in South Africa have
setusan example, andthe ques-
tion for us is ‘where is our UDF,
and who are the Boesaks and Tu-
tus of Namibia?’.

The time has come for us to
complete the circte in our strug-
gle against imperialism, tribal-
ism and colonialism.

We must not wait for anyone to
come to our ald. We must not be
demoralised by the MPC who
clalm to bring about peace and
national reconciliation. We have

seen how members of Koevoet
beat up our people in Katutura
and how Mr Dawid Bezuldenhout
called for the continued deten-
tlon of Josef Katofa. All these
deeds confirm the intention of
the MPC which is to silence
everyone who disagrees with
them.

My assessment is that the MPC
is the ‘strong arm’ of South Afri-
ca, used to further its colonialin-
terests in Namibia. The members
of the MPC do not represent the
Namibians but only their coloni-
al masijars.

People of Namibia, let us stand
up and show them we do not
need a further hijacking of our
freedom.

We have many peacetul ways
at our disposal by means of
which we can fight against the
system. Let us rally oursetvesbe-

The Namibian of November 7. |
would like to appeal to fellow Capriv-

The colonisers create a situation

ing practiced by our leaders that has
blinded all Caprivians so that they
have failed to recognise developmen-

Please stop regarding your

Please stop the false accusations
against Mr Muyongo. Whether you
are Subia or Mafwe, the UDP is for
peace, unity and freedom.

If you remain in Canu you will be
in the opposition party until death
and the majority will set up a
democratic government if needs be.

_Youalso challenged Mr M uyongo

WITH THE recent propaganda
against Swapo onthe part of the DTA
mouthpiece, | would like to bring the
following to the attention of the
public.

The facts about Swapo in that
mouthpiece are manipulated and
propagandistic in nature. The whites
who sit behind this propaganda are
exploiting the lack of knowledge of
our people. i

In 1899 to 1902 the Afrikaners
fought the Boer war. Let me mention
some factors in connection with this:

* the guerrilla war of 1899 to 1902 was
the tirst significant one in Africa:
“it was learned from them that guns
Could be taken upasa last resort and
when all other possibilities had been
exhausted;

* H-year old children fought in that
war;

* with their Calvanistic back ground,
they saw their war as rightful before
God;

* the Afrikaners did not Separate
politics and religion;

* they were convinced they fought for
their country and freedom,

* the homes and farms of the

Afrikaners were burned down by the
enemy British;

* women and children were placed in
concentration camps, where more
than 22000 children under the age of

16 are alleged to have died;

* Hensoppers were regarded as
traitors while bittereindes fought to
the finish;

* the traitors were sometimes

sentenced to death by firing squad;

* the Afrikaners were distrustful of
the English and thetr peace
imitiatives:

* children of traitors could not be
baptised in the Dutch Reformed
Church.

Taking this into account, why the
fuss about the fact that Swapo ts
holding their traitors tn detention, in
uch better condinions than these of
“he Afrikaners during the Boer War?

Already, deep in the National Par-
ty hierarchy, inthe NP church, there
iy a change against apartheid. They
are now beginning to realise the ir-
reparable damage done to the black
by means of apartheid.

View the propaganda of the
Republican Party with caution. Itis
the Broederbond’s psychological
war against Swapo. Swapo will not
be broken. Shipanga and Muyongo
tried it and failed. Do you think
Maria Boois and Beukes will get it
right?

THE CHURCH is the body of
Christ and it is the responsibility of
the church to act in the spiritual,

The Church should acknowledge
that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is to

social, political and cultural sense.

The task of the Church is to work
for God's reconciliation everywhere.

The Church hasa responsibility to
reject government policies which
deny people their human rights and
it must speak out against injustice
and preach the Chnstian message of
peace, freedom and reconciliation.

It should reject racial discrimina-
dion and racism and put forth renew-

human rights, freedom and peace
among the people.

The Church is responsible for the
welfare of its people. It cannot re-
main uninvolved because the people
under the government are also
members of the church.

The Church has to realise that the
situation in this country is contrary
to the will of God. It has to struggle

YOU HAVE GIVEN Vice Bishop
Kamecta space in your newspaper to
volce his opinion. I request thesame
Opportunity since you call yourself
achamplon for freedom of speech.

Mr Kameceta claims that the in-
dependence of Namibia is an in-
alienable right, and that itisdemand-
ed without conditions attached. He
iscight, but why does he, and his par-
ty, Swapo, refuse to acknowledge any
other political opinion in this de-
mand for independence?

Why doesn't Mr Kameeta use his
high office to ensure justice, peace
and freedom for eery Namibian?
He is aware of the fact that Swapo
does not tolerate opposition. He
knows that everybody opposing
Swapo will be subject to arbitrary
punishment or even execution
without a fair trial. Mr Kameeta
should support the call made by The
Namibian on Swapotoensurea fair
hearing for those who are accused of
being spies for South Africa.

Mr Kameeta should be aware of
the fact that many political parties in
Nainibia have urged Swapoto be an
equal partner in their opposition to
South Africa. He should also know
that Swapo refuses to drop the adjec-

tive ‘sole and authentic represen.

tative of the people of Namibia’. Ms
Lister should inform Mr Kameeta of
what her experiences are concerning
this imposed status on Swapo. Mr
Kameeta, who has vowed to preach
love, peace and righteousness,
should be inthe front to ensure that
every Namibia be granted the right
andthe opportunity to work towards
independence of this country.

Mr Kameeta knows that Swapo
regards violence as the only viable
means of allaining independence tor
Namibia, but does he consider the
fact that the majority people in this
country are peaceloving Christians
and thus prefer a negotiated
settlement?

Mr Kamecta calls for boycotts and
disinvestment and calls the potential
suffering of the majority of people
‘empty phrases’. Simullaneously this
Vice Bishop demands that ‘all peo-
ple must have the right to decent
housing, and bring up their families
incomfort and secunty. Free medica!
care and hospitalisation must be pro-
vided for all, with special care for

senior citizens, mothers and small
children. The aged and disabled must
be fully cared for by the State’,

Has it occurred to Mr Kameeta
that foreign investment is vital to
achieve these aims” Mr Kameeta ts
fully aware of the fact that Swapo
and the CCN regularly call on inter-
national financial support to
alleviate the plight of the people.
Why then should only his party and
is followers benefit from financial
aid and not the majority of the
people?

Will Mr Kameeta care to tell the
public how much he earns and how
much he pays i taxes? Will Mr
Kamecta be prepared to inform the
people of this country about the
lifestyle of those who profess to fight
tor independence and liberation
about ther contribution towards the
alleviation of the suffering peaplein
the form of financial contributions?

Can Mr Kamectainform the publicof

whathe proposes shauld be done to
obtain sufficient funds to attain what
all the people in Namibia desire?
Mr contention is that Swapo is
guilty of the most atrocious
discrimination against people. Mr
Kameeta is actively engaged in
Swapo's political activities, this
inakes him guilty of discriminating
against his own people too, Accor-

ding to the Oxford dictionary,
discrimination means to ‘make a
distinction, to give unfair treatment,
especially because of prejudice’.
Swapo and Mr Kameeta call
everybody who does not comply with
their conditions and with their opi-
mons, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pels etc. Everybody who dares to
speak against Swapo is threatened
and intimidated. Every person who
does not support Swapo is being
discriminated against. This ts
definitely not what the majority of
Namibians will support: this is what
the majority ofthe Namubians want
eradicated,

Mr Kameecta claims his fame and
right to speak about political matters
on his attest and detention. For any
law-abiding citizen, especially for
devoted Christians, defiance of the
lawis detestable. If Mr Kamectaasa
Vice Bishop and even more as a
Swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
ahenable right to self-determination,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not suppartan
organisation which sees only
violence as a moans of achieving

what they desire, namely, to take over
power of this country.
Mr Nujoma has declared more

than once that Swapo is not in-
\erested in powersharing, but onlyin
power itself, During his recent pro-
paganda tour for Swapo in West Ger-
many, Mr Kameeta has proven that
heis against any form of opposition
to Swapo and that he disputes the
right of freedom of speech of a Ger-
man citizen in his own country. With

this act added to his political antics

against the people of this country, Mr

Kameeta has disqualified himselfof
claiming to be a champion for
freedom, justice and peace.

ing them you don’t want a civil war
in Namibia. Is it not a civil war
which ts beng fought in the north?

Mr Katjiuongua, try and address
yourself to the real facts and pull
yourself out of that pool of
stupidity. .

It you try to be objective and
realistic, you would not be worried
about the positive actions of pro-

gressive parties aimed at the speedy
implementation of Resolution 43$.

People know what you stand for
and your empty promises of a ‘new
deal’ will not make the people
suscepuble to this cheap propagan-
da. You and your colleagues are
ruled by apartheid and confusion
and this makes you more reckless
than ever.

If you consider yourself a na-

False statement

PLEASE permit me to answer to
the embarrassing statement
Swapo does the same, but nobody
complains .... in The Namibian of
May 16.

The angry residents and their
tribal chief, in and around Om-
balantu in northern Namibia, are
totally against the actions of the
South African Police and Defence
Force and not against Swapo.

Obviously the people in the
north are annoyed by the South
Afncan Police and Defence Force’s
“systematic and cleverly planned’
manner of waiting until the
harvesting period before these units
come in and destroy their many
months of hard work.

In Windhoek, the Police
spokesman’s comment on the in-
cidents, in my reasoning, is alarm-
ing. His words ‘... Swapo does the
same but nobody complains ..’ are
absurd and embarrassing and
perhape deliberately said to ignore
the complaints and the truth of the

The statement ‘Swapo does the
same’ is patently false since Swapo

has no military vehicles, which ac-
cording to the complaints, the
SADF drove through mahangu
fields and homesteads. How can
someone from the north be ex-
pected to believe such a statement?

While the police and army claim
to be the defenders of the people,
the Namibians themselves have re-
jected this claim, since Namibians
have experienced untold crimes at
the hands of these forces. These
cannot be erased from our minds

We do fear the action of these
forces and call for the immediate
withdrawal of South African police
and army. We want peace, justice
and truth and this can be im-
plemented through Resolution 435.

had agreed to the implementation
of Resolution 435, but when
Reagan came {0 power in
Washington, he and South Africa
brought in the linkage issue. This
is NOW made a precondition to our
independence.

The Cuban Internationalists
have been in Angola almost three
years prior to the introduction of
Resolution 435. They were only
found to be a threat after six years.

This is a feeble excuse and ploy
by western capitalists regarding
Namubia.

We in Namibia have tried on-
three occasions to bring and end to
the shedding of blood and the suf-
fering of our people, but all were
in vain. In Geneva in 1981, Swapo
was ready to sign a ceasefire and
put Resolution 435 into operauion,
and this was repeated in Lusaka in
1984 and on Cape Verde later that
year, but the South African
Government turned a deal ear.

Mr P W Botha told the world
that Swapo was the one delaying
independence and opting for
violence, whereas Swapo had stated
often that a ceasefire was the only
way to end the war.

If Mr P W Botha could just tell
us openly that he is afraid of a
Swapo victory if Resolution 438 ts
implemented. Swapa would win
the elections overwhelmingly,
which 16 why the Reagan Adc-
ministrauon is backing Pretoria on
the Cuban tssue.

The South African Government
Is again playing with us by saying
that Swapo must talk to the interim
government in Windhoek. Why
should Swapo talk to their sur-
rogates? The country is not oc-
cupied by Mudge-Shipanga-
Katjiuongua, but by Pretoria.

They talk of reconciliation, but

(annacean Veer case peanadmeoreesl) anakeale nyeuanes
OT —

Katjiuongua, but by Pretoria.

They talk of reconciliation, but
Swapo has no quarrel with them,

The people of Namibia want
peace and freedom just as any
other country in the world.

The Reagan Administration has
gone as far as to invite Jonas
Savimbi to Washington. He is even
supplied with sophisticated
weapons like Stinger missiles and
the like to cause suffering among
the Angolan people. There is now
a form of military pact between
Pretoria and Washington to build
up their self-created Angolan ban-
dit group.

Reagan, with the support of
Thatcher in London, attacked
‘Libya recently, killing innocent
people of that country. Reagan ac-
cuses that country of ‘training ter-
rorists’, but one need only look at
the actions of the US in Grenada,
and now in Nicaragua, Angola,
Afghanistan and Cambodia.

In the UN debates, it is the very
Reagan Administration, along with
other capitalist countries, which are
vetoing decisions taken against
South Africa and Israel. But it
never asked capitalist America
alongwith its allies, to Impose
economic. sanctions against
Poland, Iran and recently, Libya.

hey are using the cheap pretext
that the Majority of blacks would
suffer in South Africa, Namibia
and the entire southern Africa if
Sanctions were imposed. This is
nonsense, for we gain nothing from
the economy of our country. The
Majority of blacks live jn poverty,
and it is we who join the call for
sanctions against the South African
Government.

It is time that the world turn
their attention to the plight of the
people of Namibia and South
Africa under the apartheid
government.

AN OPEN LETTER TO
MR SAREL BECKER
AND FOLLOWERS

OVER THE years, when apartheid
was in its raw stages, it was mark-
ed with doors for ‘Whites only’.
‘Whites only’ could enter these
doors, regardless of their religion,
social standing, tradition or race.

The only precondition was that
the skin colour be ‘white’.

The man with the black skin had
to keep away from ‘your’ regions
and reservations.

1 will not ask what you have
against the colour of my skin, Mr
Becker. By maintaining this rigid
attitude, you have made your
message clear to the blacks of
Namibia. As far as you are con-
cerned, there is no compromise on
apartheid without a colour change.

ironically, the very segregation
you are now seeking, was provid-
ed in the past. Someone was wise
enough to foresee conflicting
nature of the white man and black
man, and kept them apart. Your
forbears were in Holland and there
the chances of keeping vour race
pure, were perfect

On what grounds can you now
fence in the black man to safeguard
the punty of your white race if you,
yourself, have broken the natural
segregation by crossing the ocean?

Of course we dare not overlook
the fact that your forbears brought
the first hight of Christian faith and -
civilisation into the most southern *
part of Africa. This opened our
eyes (o new horizons of education,
civilisation, faith and progress.

Incidentally, the white man also
introduced to us the first spark of
the gun, the very evil he suffers
under today. In fact the mass
slaughter of blacks on December 16
1836, is a testive day for your
government - contrary to the Chris-
Han faith which strives for peace,
love and unity.

You came to Africa, heavily
armed and with apartheid.

Surely you are an advocate of
‘whites only’ churches, a religion
practised, understood and accep-
(able to only a small part of the
community. With the help of God
we have partly outgrown that stage.

Lastly Mr Becker, your thoughts
Jo not justify your existence in
Africa, unless you change them
and bring them into the open. —

ALLOW ME to express my views
on Messrs Andreas Shipanga,
Moses Katjiuongua, and Fanuel
Kozonguizi, about their positions
and what they are doing to the sul-
fering Namibian people.

As a brother and fellow coun-
tryman, I would be guilty if | did
not state my views in regard to your
present positions, labelled as
cabinet ministers by an unelected
interim government appointed by
the South African Government, be-
ing used as carriers of apartheid
and collaborators of the South
African Government; and being us-
ed to oppress the already oppress-
ed suffering Namibian people, your
own people, your own blood.

Did you know you are delaying
the country’s independence by
allowing yourselves to be used by
the South African Government
which is still exploiting our natural

civilian population. :

How did you feel at the. time,
giving approval to an army of
occupation?

Brothers, 1 want to remind you
that your forerunners, ard others
who have sold out to the enemy,
are forgotten, and were
like rotten fruit to the dustbin. You
should seriously reconsider your
positions in opposing your own
people.

You know you don’t have the
support of even two percent of the
Namibian people, so please open
the doors for Resolution 435 to
clect our leaders. We know them
well.

My message (Oo peace-loving
Namibians is that they should unite
and fight the darkness of evil
among us. Let us fight for our
future generations, and leave

{ AM an Ovambo-speaking man
who is very disappointed male his
fellow countrymen.

1 was told I could get a job i in the
building construction industry in
Tsumeb, and had to see a man at
the Tsumeb Municipality. He told
me to come back the following
morning at 07h00, which I did, and
he made me wait all day. I was
eventually told I could not get the
job, and then after a friend of mine
again requested, I was told to go
to the Municipality once again.

When | did so, the man told me
there were no jobs for Ovambo-
speaking people, but only
Damaras, Namas and Coloureds.

Some of our brothers in govern-
ment offices treat others on a tribal
and discriminatory basis. While the
Ovambo-speaking people are those
who are suffering the most, one has
to hear that they are ‘thieves and
terrorists’, and they are
discriminated against in job
situations.

| had used my own money to go
to Tsumeb for that job, and had no
place to sleep and nothing to eat.

Blacks always blame the whites
for discrimination and racism, but
some of our own people, like the
one who dealt with me at the
Municipality, are oppressing their
own people.

We should learn from these
mistakes so we should not make the
same mistakes tn the future.

Our country is torn by war and
this situation will only be resolved
if the people of the country can
work hand in hand for peace. This
peace will only come through love,
and an understanding of our duty
to the nation, and if we forget the

see one another as brothers and

Sanctions: Yes

THRE CALL tor total cconomic
sanctions against apartherd South
Atnica is justified. South Africa has
rejected all reasonable demands to
do away with the outdated and
degrading system of apartheid and
oppression of the blacks.

The promoters of economic
sanctions have the real interests of
the oppressed masses of South
Africa and Namibia at heart; and
economic sancuons is the alter-
native to total war. In fact
economic sanctions is a call for
‘peaceful change’ to enable the
blacks to govern in the land of their
birth and creation.

Those who are against economic
sanctions are only trying to protect
their own interests and exploitation
of the blacks. The claim that the
blacks would suffer if economic
sancuions were applied, should be
rejected with the contempt it
deserves. The blacks are suffering
already and additional temporary
suffering won’t matter to us as long
as freedom is achieved.

The blacks have no economic in-
terests to protect and defend - their
main interest NOW is to liberate
themselves at all costs.

The US and British attitude is
Clearly capitalistic and self-interest
aimed at protecting the in-
vestments. The fear of economic
loss is stronger to them than the
freedom and lives of the blacks in
apartheid South Africa. It ig
because of the double standards of
the Western powers that blacks
have lost interest in slogans like
‘democracy’ Blacks lived in peace
and harmony until the arrival of
the white settlers and colonisers.

It fills one with dismay to hear
about blacks saying that apartheid
is dead in Namibia. Apartheid in
Namibia as still alive and kicking,
even the socalled black ‘ministers’
complain about apartheid meted
outto them by secretaries of other
“Mintsters’,

The abolition of apartheid is not
what we are calling for - we are not
fighting for reforms - we want to
GOVERN this country. We are
fighting for the nght to decide our
own destiny and our destiny 1s not
linked to apartheid or neo-
colomalism.

The whites of this country are
not prepared to change or ready
themselves for change. They still
believe in their oppressive doctrines
und dogmas.

Even the Secretary for Finance
is calling for methods to prepare
against economic sanchons, instead
of calling for drastic changes in the
status quo in order to meet the
reasonable demands of the op-
pressed masses.

The whites must remember one
thing: they may be in a temporary
postion to delay independence. Dut
thes cannot present

The whites are shouting that they
ate Hehting on the border (o defend
them rotten sytem of apartheid.
They should femember that we
never invited them here with their
oppressive system, and now they
ure calling on us blacks to defend
and fight to retain oppression and
apartheid.

We hear that the army 1s 80 per-
cent black and 20 percent white -
but who are the 20 percent? They
are the elite, the white officers, the
ones in charge. The 80 percent
blacks are there only to run errands
and to be ordered to kill their own
kith and kin.

If the whites are prepared to die
for what is not theirs, what about
us who have a country to regain
and a people to liberate? Whites
should remember that violence
breeds violence - they have practis-
ed violence since the first white
man put his foot on Namibian soil
and have not stopped ever since. In
fact they have accelerated it. Blame
for any violence or bloodshed
should be placed squarely at the
door of the whites.

Dear Mr Cleary

YOU too have done some ‘remarkable’
pieces of writing, most recently in
Leadership (Volume $ 1986 Number 2),
in which you measure the success of ihe
interim government by means of the
vague generaltsation of ‘inclusivity’.
This ‘government’, you say, seeks to in-
volve all parties and also to draw to
these same parties, the support
previously enjoyed by those outside it.

May we remind you that there are six
parties (some in name only) which en-
joy membership of the interim govern-
ment. Membership of ‘other parties’,
however minor their support, who have
shown interest in the interim govern-
ment, has been turned down, and I refer
in particular to the recent HNP request
for membership of the ‘Constitutional
Council’.

‘Inclusivity’, therefore, hardly seems
to be the goal of this interim
government,

You have not explained why the DTA
prefers to operate outside your con-
sultancy service, and it has been wide-
ly reported (not only in The Namibian)
that there has been a breakdown in
communication between yourself and
Mr Dirk Mudge, an interim government
miniMer you claim to represent,

What is perhaps of note, is your
— geference to the ‘Transitional Govern-

| ment’, rather than the ‘Government of

National Unity’, Even you can no-

longer claim that there is “unity” in their
ranks, any more than you can claim that
there is ‘consensus’ on the question of
AG 86 despite socalled mnanimnous

resolutions concerning the removal of —

ethnic and racial discrimination.

AN OPEN LETTER TO DR
ABISAI SHEJAVALI

NEITHER YOU, Dr Shejavali, nor any
of your colleagues of the Council of
Churches (CCN) have as yet reacted to
the barbarous bomb attack on innocent
civilians in Walvis Bay on August 2.
Nobody expects you as a Christian to
take sides in the struggle over
SWA/Namibia, but as a christian you
should condemn all forms of violence.
You did not and have never before con-
demned violence and atrocities commit-
ted by Swapo and therefore | take it for
granted that vou condone one form of
violence and condemn another suiting
your own political whims and
aspirations.

As the majority of my countrymen
I condemn violence of any form to
achieve political aims. Nobody denies
that members of the security forces do
commit violence against members of the
local population. Such members are
however brought before court and | can
substantiate this statement with a list of
trials. | do however assume that you
doubt the impartiality and in-
dependence of our courts of law.
However it may be there is not one case
Swapo has brought before a couriof
justice to try one of its members czaxn-
mitting affocities against innocent
civilians.

On the’ contrary: Swapo cold-
bloodediy murder a mother and young
child in Grootfontein. The same peo-
ple killed two parents in front of their
two daughters on a farm near Okahan-
dja. After one of them was sentenced
to death and subsequently hanged,
Swapo hailed him as a martyr.

, Swapo assassinated Chief Kapuuo
And Headman' Tolvo Shiyagaya and
‘fem Nujoma’ praises them for their
a ‘ ic ctur ke Elifas, Pastor saat and
in most of Swapo’s publications
which are circulated as widely as possi-
ble, this organisation lists the numbers
of landmines they have laid. Often the
mames of people who were murdered
also appear on these documents. Swapo
also acknowledges abductions of young
men and women. These atrocities are
lauded as acts in the struggle for in-
dependence. Mr Katjavivi says people
are not abducted, but only taken to be
re-educated.

Neither you, Dr Shejavali, nor any
of your colleagues have ever condemn-

ed these senseless atrocities against in- —

nocent civilians. On numerous occa-
sions, internally and abroad, you have
publicly called for support for Swapo
in its struggle against the ‘oppressors’.
Not once have you called on Swapo to
cease the atrocities against civilians.
Power pylons, electric installations,
water pumps, reservoirs and telecom-
munications links are being sabotaged

by Swapo. These acts of sabotage are

pot aimed. at the security forces, but
vagainst the local population. How can
‘a christian like you, Dr Shejavali, re-
main silent when Swapo sabotages the

3 ter'supply to innocent civilians who
have.no bart. in the war? a

i a el if ih
H tp
Is my assumption justified that you
support Swapo’s numerous calls and
statements for the increase of violence;
that you reiterate threats made by
Swapo leaders that Swapo will
demonstrate its power if her
unreasonable demands are not being
met; that you know Swapo has in-
timidated inhabitants of this country by
threatening to step up their acts of
violence which includes specifically
bombings?

The murderous attack on civilians in
Walvis Bay on August 2 was one of
those bombings which Swapo threaten-
ed to execute. If this is not the fact, then
you Dr Shejavali, should request Swapo
to deny responsibility for this atrocitiy
and those recently committed in
Katutura and Khomasdal as well as
those numerous acts of terrorism
against our own people.

You are in favour of the implemen- |
tation of Resolution 435, so am [| and |
the majority of our people. But we de-
mand this be on the basis of a fair
democratic election. Swapo’s President
has on several occasions stated
categorically that Swapo is not in-
__ terested in democracy in Namibia, but
_only'in the total cratrol and power over,

j this country andJour people.
-Swapo has repeatedly demanded that

the control and power over Namibia

and our people should be handed over

directly to Swapo, Swapo consistently

rejects the democratic gestures of

_ leaders of the transitional government

to deliberate with them to find an ac-

‘ceptable, peaceful and lasting solution

to our political problems. Swapo claims
to be the ‘sole and authentic represen-

‘tative of the people of Namibia’.

Nobody else, not even the rest of the
/Ai-//Gams group, but Swapo, has a
say in the future of our people and you,
paradoxically, support this atrocity.
You, Dr Shejavali, have a calling and
an obligation as a Christian to search

in the name of God for righteousness,

justice and peace for all men irrespec-

_ tive of their race, sex, creed or colour
' ~ or political aspirations - and yet you

I WOULD like to praise Professor
Lombard and Mrs Parkhouse and
others for their courage in meeting
with the Swapo leadership in
_ Lusaka at the 10th anniversary of
~~UNIN.
They have showed us that there
are some whites who want to see
~Namibia freed from South African
occupation. They have also set an
example to other whites, to show
where they stand in the struggle
towards a non-oppressive and non-
exploitative, free Namibia.

I would personally like to call
upon the white majority to stand
up and join the struggle in order to
gain independence for Namibia.

Let us unite: black and white and
not allow ourselves to be misled by
the evil forces which try to under-
mine the struggle of peaceloving
-Namibians towards freedom.

Reply to Shipanga
MR ANDREAS Shipanga said in
a recent letter published in two
Windhoek newspapers that ‘Many
of our members and thousands of
other Namibians were not so for-
tunate. They were imprisoned, tor-
tured, raped and murdered ...’

Was this what you were doing
when you were one of the Swapo
leaders? I ask this because yOu say
you ‘know’.

It is also not the first time you
accuse Mr Sam Nujoma, our Presi-
dent, of being ‘stupid’. I don’t need
to tell you just how dynamic our
President is; he who led our peo-
ple, Swapo, through very difficult
times, and because of Mr Nujoma,
South Africa has failed in her ob-
jective to destroy Swapo.

Victorian language was never 4

uisite for charismatic leader-
ship. President Nujoma speaks
good English, and I remember a
white woman once said: ‘I, #0 far,

Shipanga’s English’.

ONCE, America told the world that
the ‘constructive engagement policy
was there to encourage peaceful
changes in the apartheid policy of
South Africa. Yet the Reagan Ad-
ministration assists South African
militarily against the freedom
fighters.
I do not know whether Mr Ronald
Reagan and his administration know
what the word ‘peace’ in the real
sense means. The policy of ‘construc-
tive engagement’ seeks to perceive
communist encroachment on South
Africa; and seeks to keep the region
safe for American capital and to use
the South Africans to police it.

‘Koevoetura’

OUR residential area, Katutura, is
nowadays patrolled nightly by

members of Swapol, better Sanit as
-‘Koevoet’.” i

While the idea of keeping an eye on
this area with a view to curbing
crime is acceptable, the consequences

of their presence here is such that

many people get assaulted
unreasonably.

In so doing the police are no longer
doing what they are supposed to do.

In a white residential area, no one
ever gets hit with a sjambok or blind-
ed by strong hunting lamps.

It makes one feel that Katutura is
nothing but a game reserve where
people go to ‘hunt’.

I would suggest that the police deal
more gently with the inhabitants of
this town, and if action is to be taken,
then let an arrest be made, rather .
than random assaults. The problem 7

The Namibian people, under the

When one travels Namibia, one sees
evidence of how our resources are ex-

down to the south is always full of
heavy duty trucks loaded with cattle
being taken to South African markets,
while many ofour children are looking
for food in rubbish bins and are sleep-

(7 1S my contention that Nambia
needs a unitary education system to
guide its people and control its rate
nf development.

‘The powers of education should he
centralised. We need a government
‘which is committed to secure the
enoperation of the people of this coun-
try. We need a democratic govern-
ment which rules by a constitution
approved by the majority of its peo-
"" ple. Its purpose should be the protec-
tion of life, property, and not based
on force and authority. We need a
higher standard of living and social
security in Namibia. We need ade-
quate food, shelter and medical ser-
vices, We need education for personal
growth and happiness. We need a
strong government.

In Namibia each ethnic govern-
ment has an education minister. The
purpose of this education is to equip
the African child for his place a5 a
labourer in Namibia. The ministry of
education is given unrestricted
powers to decide what schools should
exist, service for teachers and the
content of black education. It plans
{o separate one race from another.
Economically, politically and social-
ly, whites are at the apex and blacks
at the bottom. The emphasis is on
quantity and not quality. The educa-
tion of blacks is inferior and teaching
is done through the medium of ver-
naculars up to Standard Six, then
there is a sudden switch to learning
English and Afrikaans. The standard
of English in particular has dropped
disastrously. The black student is in
a terrible dilemma for he either ac-
cepts such education or gets no
education at all.

It is my contention that there is a
need for a clear national educational
policy in Namibia, and a compulsory
and unitary education system.

Blacks and whites should govern
the country in harmony; we share
many things and should share the
land under one government. We
share a common history and culture
and we can speak to one another in
our national languages. Namibia
needs a national symbol to give usa
sense of belonging og a nation.

Education should not separate
black and white; and children should
not be taught that blacks are lazy, in-
ferior, stupid and 80 on.

Education for black children is
scarce and inadequate. It is the cause
of all the political unrest in Namibia.

Namibians do not see ethnic
governments as their governments;
or the constilutions as their constitu:
tion; they have become politically-
divorced and frustrated,

In the final analysis, we need a
strong unitary government againat
external forces, because unity is
strength. We need new methods of
organisation, new skills, new in-
sights, new dreams and visions. We
need a climate in which Namibia can
keep peace with the world.

It is the time now to transform
Namibia into a better nation. It ia
time to put political differences asdie
and form one Namibia, one nation.

Not starving

I] WOULD like to respond to a report
in the interim government propagan-
da mouthpiece of November 3, which
criticised church-run schools in the
territory.

Mr Andrew Matjila, Education
Minister, said that we were disad-
vantaged hecause we were
undernourished.

Church schools are contributing
much to our country, and our eves
and minds are kept open in these
schools. We have a fair system of
education, and we feel at home.

Coming to Mr Matjila’s point that
we are locked into our hostels: this
is not true. Everyone has the right
to go home with the permission of
staff members, and this is a sign of
order. We are protected by the church
as future leaders of this country. .

Truly speaking, we are thankful for
the good we are getting. We eat in
order to survive and not to get fat as
he is doing. If he wants to make us
fat, then they have to implement a
system of equal education in this
country.

Mr Matjila should also not confuse
himself about Swapo and the Coun.
cil of Churches. They are using the
money for peaceful means, while he
and his colleagues have grabbed
possession of the country, including
the education system.

He and his colleagues spent a for-
tune on military training, while peo-
ee are dying. Leave church schools

ae
The things mentioned in that
report are occurrences at schools
resorting under National Education.
Many of them are undernourished,
and they are also locked up, like at
the Augustineum, where students
are afraid of the Koevoet security
guards.

When | look at what happens at
State schools, I do not fee] bad about
the situation in which myself and my
colleagues at church schools find
ourselves. What happened at the
Augustineum, Mr Matjila? There
they are locked up and are forbidden
from participating in student
organisations, such as Nanso.

This is a sign that their rights have
been taken away. We are happy to be
at church schools, because our minds
are free, and we have the opportun)-
ty to air our political views.

Mr Matjila, think before you speak.
Leave the church schools in peace.

Myself and fellow Namibian
students dream of the day when
equal and fair education will be
granted to all. Education without
liberation is worthless.

here as Koevoet.

I was invited to the peace rally (sic)

Swapo police! Dreesed resplendently,
some with wooden AK-47 rifles,
painted blue, green and red. Tradi-
tional kieries and spears (covered with
cooldrink cans to make gure the sharp
points cause no incidental harm).

The peace rally was opened with o
prayer. An old black man, praying in
Afrikaans, for the rally to be peaceful
and in the name of God. There were
some speeches and then a group of
socalled vigilantes started injuring
people and damaging cars in the road.
They were chased away by the Swapo
police and we all started singing again,
determined to allow peace to get the
upper hand.

Distortions

THE ARTICLES in the interim
government mouthpiece of 11.12.86
and 19.12.86, are malicious and a
blatant distortion of the truth. The
allegation against Mr Shapua
Kaukungua is that paper's own
fabrication. They are writing what
they probably wanted to hear. | am
not surprised by these lies, because
a system based on lies, cannot be
defended with the truth.

l repeat my statement made in the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in
Katutura at Mr Shifidi's funeral that
the “socalled government of national
unity is morally responsible for his
death”. The death of Mr Shifidi is an
urgent call on this ‘government’ to
step down, and in so doing, allow the
implementation of UNSC Resolution
435.

As long as this ‘government’ is in
power, it will be responsible for the
blood of the Namibians which has
been soaking the soil for more than
a century. What happened on that
fateful Sunday of November 30 last
year was not a mere ‘bakleiery’ as
that newspaper pretends. which is
why we are demanding an indepen-
dent judicial commission of inquiry
to reveal the truth.

I challenge Mr Eben van Zijl and
his government to allow the appoint-
ment of such a commission if ita (the
government) conscience is clear on
what happened that day.

Without justice there will be no
reconciliation and peace in Namibia.

| 1986. OAME .and faded away as
qitickly.as the rainbow and 1967 has
For us, the
masses of Namibia, i it is now time to
reflect on the happenings of the past
year. Waa it a successful year as far
_ as the struggle is concerned? Did we
achieve what we set out to achieve,
and if not why?

First of all we must find answers
to these questions before we can plan
for the new year. The aim of our plan-

should be to make a success out
of failures of the past and to
achieve our independence. It is aleo
now time for us to state our aims and
purpose as clearly as never before.
We should state our views without
fear or favour.

Our aim was and is and always
shall be the independence of our
country. It must be every Namibian’s
wish and desire to be free ... and |
mean free in the real sense of the
word.

Our independence is not
negotiable. We have negotiated for
too long hence the long delay in ob-
taining our desired independence.
Our direction should be very clear ...
independence now and at all costs.
We should stop these half-hearted ef.
forts. We should go all out to liberate
our country.

The call and onus is on us to unite
the divided people of Namibia into
one cohesive liberation front or
movement.

The unity I am talking about is not
unity for the sake of shouting that we
are united ... 1 mean unity of purpose
and action ... the purpose being our
liberation. We must have the purpose
of fighting the common enemy and
even more ... to defeat the enemy. We
have nothing to lose but our chains.

We must learn from our mistakes
and those of our forefathers and rec-
tify them before it is too late. We
should also learn from other African

The time for talk about unity is
long overdue. It is now time to act
unity. It is time to involve all the
Namibians in the unity of purpose
process.

The masses must ask their leaders
to unite them for the sake of our in-
dependence and beloved fatherland.
We should not give the enemy the
chance of further dividing our
already divided people. The enemy
did it by creating eleven ethnic
governments. He did it by buying
and bribing some of our people. He
did it by his political ideology - ter.
ming some of us terrorists and com.
munists. He ts still doing it with his
radio and TV broadcasts. Finally he
is doing it by taking some black
money: mongerers into towns to
create a black middle class-cum-elite.
The irony is that these blacks think
they are destroying apartheid. The
truth is that they are being used to
strengthen apartheid.

Multiracialism and liberalism have
never been the friends of those under
oppression. All these terms tend to
create divisions in the liberation
movement and some confused blacks
tend to think that by associating with
whites, they are better than other
blacks. History has proved that white
liberalism is an enemy of the strug.
gle for freedom. Whites cannot
enslave us and at the same time
claim to be our liberators. Freedom
is not a gift, its a victory, and that
victory will only be achieved by the
blacks themselves. History has pro-
ved that whites in the ranks of the
liberation movement tend to be spies
and informers. Whites tend to be in
control or to contro! whether they are
in the majority or minority.
Wherever the whites went, they went
to control.

Socialism is the basis of the African
culture and also part of the African
revial and struggle to regain the lost
glory and freedom. Socialism is a way
of life for the African and not a
foreign, imported ideology as claim-
ed by white capitalism. Blacks own.
ed everything commonly, even the
moet powerful kings did not claim or
own private land or waterholes.
Socialism should not only be preach-
ed, but practiced ... in fact it should
be lived. We as socialists should put
the example of being true socialists.
We should stop living as capitalists
= _ aaa lUUlUlUler ll

while preaching socialism. The peo-
ple should be prepared for the Great
Socialist Revolution which is going
to tranaform the entire Namibian
society.

Namibian masses must stand
together and ca]] and end to the op-
pression meted out to you. If the
leaders are not taking any initiative,
then you are at liberty to take actions
to liberate the country. Let us make
1987 the final year of our struggle for
independence.

We have been hearing about peace
and reconciliation in Namibia ...
what a misuse of words and terms.
The fact is there is no peace in
Namibia and there won't be peace in
Namibia unless the enemy is driven
out and we resume our rightful place
and control of our country. There
won't be reconciliation in Namibia
between the oppressed and op-
pressors. What are we reconciling?
Oppression? No way. The real peace
and reconciliation will come when
the black man has come to his rights
and power. We cannot talk about
peace and reconciliation in Namibia
unless we are trying to bluff
ourselves as the white liberals are do-
ing today. To the white liberals we
aay: you cannot achieve or solve
anything by working with your pup-
peta or tamed blacka. The key to the
solution of the Namibian problem
lies with the true blacks ... the
revolutionaries, We are holding the
key to speace, freedom and tranquili-
ty in Namibia. —

I REFER to the letter. which ap-
peared in The Namibian of February
6 1987, written by Mr Clive Algar,
Rossing Uranium's public affairs
manager, accuging Swapo's UN
representative, Mr Helmut Angula,
of making ‘extravagant statements’
about Rossing.

As I looked at Mr Clive Algar’s let-
ter, I quickly realised that this was
@ public relations officer painting a
good picture of his company.

First and foremost I would like to
hear from Mr Algar who has
authorised Rossing to mine uranium
in Namibia. According to my sources,
this company was given a green light
by South Africa in 1970, four years
after the UN General Assembly
revoked South Africa’s mandate to
rule Namibia. Was Rossing ignorant
of UN Decree Number 1 which clear-
ly states: “No person or entity,
whether a body corporate or uncor-
porate, may search for, take, extract,
mine, refine, use, sell, export or
distribute any natural resources
whether animal or mineral! situation
.. within the territorial limite of
Namibia without the consent of the
UN Council for Namibia”.

Were you aware that Ne Namibia is a

the fact that you are ‘giving’ them
what is theirs after robbing them.

Mr Angula was speaking in the in-
teresta of the oppressed and suffering
people of Namibia.

ACCORDING to a report published
in the Republikein of March 6 1987,
interim government Minister, An.
dreas Shipanga, ‘sharply criticised’
and expressed his ‘disappointment’
about certain statementa the Vicar
General of the Roman Catholic
Church, Father Bernhard Nor-
dkamp, had allegedly made during
an address given at a youth seminar,
which, again according to the report,
is said to have been organised by the
Council of Churches. The report
relates to what Mr Shipanga 1s alleg.
ed to have said during a meeting of

the National Assembly on March 5

1987.

Mr Shipanga, according to the
report, bases his claim about what

the Vicar General had said during

the youth seminar held at Dobra, on

a letter by an unidentified “Win-

~ dhoek student'’ which letter was
- published in the Windhoek Observer

of February 28, 1987. The “student”
alleges, inter alia, that Father Nor-

- dkamp had said that “law and order
are sin”. For the purposes of this

statement it is sufficient to state that
the letter contains further very
serious distortions and outright un-
truths. It represents nothing but a
very ill-considered attempt to amear
the Roman Catholic Church and to
discredit the Vicar General, whose
commitment to bringing about
justice with peace in a truly Chris-
tian society in Namibia is well

| known

Against this background, Mr
Shipanga's criticism ie evidently un-

| warranted and uncalled for. Yet Mr

Shipanga, who holds hia high office
by virtue of an appointment by the
Routh African Government, sean fit

to simply repeat these untrue allege:
tions of what the Vicar General is

taken to have said, relying on
nothing more than an anonymous |

Cabinet minister can simply accept
serious allegations without further
verification. Mr Shipanga’s failure to
check his facta is even more frighten-
ing in view of the extremely wide ar-
bitrary executive powers which are
vested in him. and his colleagues in
the Cabinet of the interim govern-
ment by virtue of numerous socall-
ed security laws, which would clear-
ly require the greatest measure of —
restraint and responsibility. These
laws not only offend against fun.
damental human rights, but alsoin- |
vite serious abuses of due process and |
the Rule of Law. .

It is most disturbing that Mr
Shipanga, at the taxpayer's expense,
and protected by a statutory immuni-
ty against possible legal action,
repeats unchecked allegations by an
obecure letter writer and then, on the
basis of those slanderous allegations
proceeds to ‘sharply’ criticise a senior
and respected Priest of the order of
the Oblates whose dedication
towards the protection of Christian
values in this territory can hardly be |
questioned. !

Mr Shipanga has chosen Father |
Nordkamp as a target of severe |
criticism. At the same time Mr |
Shipanga however chooses to remain
silent about the Police’s admission
under oath in the Heita trial present-
ly before the Windhoek Supreme
Court, presenting a picture of brutal
violations of the most elementary
human rights and an alarming
disregard for law and order by the
police. : -

In view of the aforesaid, this order
wishes to record its strongest objec: |
tion to Mr Shipanga’s criticiam of |
Father Bernhard Nordkamp.

SEVENTY -five percent of the Herero
people were killed by Germans dur
ing their brutal colonial rule over
Namibia. The Nama people were
reduced to 50 percent. The problem
we have today, which is South
African colonialiam, is built up on the
foundation created and cemented by

German colonialiam. Germany has a

historical responsibility and role to
play in the decolonisation of Namibia
because she opened that colonial door
through which South African col-
onialism entered Namibia.

As a Namibian, a victim of that
German colonialism, I was shocked
to read in the Windhoek Advertiser
of November 21 1986 that the Etango
movement received 30 000 Rand
from West Germany. This was an-
nounced by the socalled chief coor.
dinator of Etango, Mr Andre van der
Kolff.

Etango (like Koevoet which is link:
ed to the police) appears to be part of
the South African Defence Force, and
therefore linked to it. “Donations”
from West Germany mean to every
Namibian: the financing the killing
of Namibians, prolonging the col.
onial rule they started, prolonging
the suffering of Namibians.

We also know that West Germany
supplics SA with military technology
and about 90 percent of the SADF
means of transport is from West Ger-
many. Now it is again ‘‘donations”
and we don’t know what the next will
be.

Soon Namibia will be free and the
independent Namibia will draw up
a list identifying our friends and
those who supported liberation.
Thosé who are financing colonial
forces and their squads, such as
Koevoet and Etango, are already
creating their grounds not to appear
on that list where all freedom and
peace-loving countries in the world
will appear.

Our message to them is: support
the liberation of Namibia and. the
abolition of apartheid in South Africa
and Namibia, instead of reviving the
colonial past which has already
many other historical mistakes and
crimes 10t only against the Nami-
bian people, but against other Euro-
pean countries just 40 years ago.

THE NAMIBIAN of March 27
published an article attempting to
throw suspicion on Christian Ac-
tion asa front for the Defence Force,
because an officer of the SWA Ter-
ritory Force is a member of Chris-
tian Action. This open letter is sub-
mitted for publication toinform in-
terested persons and the public at
large of the true facts of the
controversy.

MS GWEN LISTER:

YOU apparently have serious problems
with any person or event that 1s not 1n &<or-
dance with your figments of the imadina.
tion regarding situations and related events
in our country. You chose to ignore Chris-

tian Action’s request that you submit in
writing your questions about CA to us. In-
stead, your action was to attempt to cast
suspicion on Christian Action in public
Christian Action will therefore follow your
example in using the public media to afford
all interested persons the opportunity to
read what Christian Action stands for as op-
posed to what you stand for. We consequent.
ly challenge you to consider investigating
Christian Action, and to publish your fin.
dings. We, in turn, will definitely not
hesitate tokeepthe publicinformedof CA's
activities,

Ms Lister, you and your accomplices were
requested in no uncertain terms to submit
in writing your queries about Christian Ac-
tion, to ensure that Christian Action if not
victimised by a person's own, possibly incor-
rect, understanding of the true meaning of
comment made by Christian Action.

You however considered yourself too
elevated to correspond with honest people.
You even went to far astotwist the little we
did say. Christian Action’s request that was
that you put your questions in writing so
that we would have aclear understandiny:
of your inquiry, and you would have an ab-
solutely clear understanding of our reply
The material would then have been very
useful to both you and ourselves should a
misunderstanding have arisen. Would such
action not have been more responsible and
professionally journalistic?

You, Ms Lister, really have nothinp
against Christian Action assuch Youhave
a tremendous amount to say about the fact
that Christian Action vehemently objects to
socalled clergymen who are more involved
with politics(and not even objectively)than
with their spiritual tasks It is no secret that
Christian Action identified the fact that cer-
tain socalled clergymen attempt to mislead
their congregation so that anti-christians,
communists and suchlike can force their
own ideology which contradicts the Bible,
on their people. Therefore, all you could do,
Ms Lister, was to attempt to cast suspicion
on the strong point of view made by a
member of Christian Action.

What you did will not work, Ms Lister. You
forget that Co] Radmore is not Christian Ac-
tion. You forget that Col Radmore is a

member of Christian Action.

What you did will not work, Ms Lister. You
forget that Col Radmore is not Christian Ac-
tion. You. forget that Col Radmore is a
disciplined Christian who does not hesitate
to acknowledge his strong belief in and love
for the Lord in public. You fail to appreciate
the fact that Col Radmore is one of the many
who knows what atrocious and senseless
terrorist deeds Swapo and their puppets
commit among the population. You, Ms
Lister, will possibly not be able to unders-
tand why a person like Col Radmore can be
outspoken for the Lord. You are seriously
mistaken, Me Lister, when you think that
through naive mudslinging against a per-
son, youcan cast suspicion on Christian Ac.
tion, amongst fellow Christians. There are
many Christians, Ms Lister, in this lovely
country of ours, who like Col Radmore are
genuine in their belief. Many are members
of the Defence Force, the Police Force, the
private sector, the state, businessmen, even
newsmen and women.

Ms Lister, you gofurther in your attempt
at casting suspicion by insinuating that
Christian Action could possibly be con-
nected with the Department of INforma.
tion. Forget these tactics, they don't work.
Christians have direction. They know what
the Lord expects of them, and they don't
need to be connected with anyone or
anything other than the Lord. We will sup-
port each other, and jointly we Christians,
irrespective of where we are, will fight Satan
in whatever form he may appear. Ms Lister,
you will be astounded to hear how many
members of Christian Action and other
Christians support this viewpoint, and who
differ with you in this respect.

Hundreds of people support Christian Ac-
tion, Ms Lister. Many, many Christians
havecontributed financially and otherwise
to enable Christian Action to reach out to
fellow-Christians to inform them who the
real enemy is, and to tel] how certain

and their puppets misuse the Bi-

ble and the Lord to promote their own idol
in a fashion foreign to our Christian nation.

We believe more people read the newslet-
ter of Christian Action than those reading
your little newspaper. However, you are
more than welcome tocontinue publishing
names of members of Christian Action, and
what Christian Action stands for. We have
nothing to hide. We are proud of the fact that
we can serve the Lord, and that we are not
dependent on the whims and woes of Swapo
politicians and their puppets, interested on-
ly in power and whodon’t hesitate to murder
and maim thousandsof people in their quest
for power.

Christian Action will not cease to keep
fellow Christians informed to what degree
socalled clergymen are involved with
recruitment and incitement of youth to sow
death and destruction as young terrorists,
and of how socalled clergymen are
manipulated by Swapo to proclaim and
often preach, that Swapo is the only
representative of the people of this country.

We will also continue to indicate how
socalled clergymen are involved with inter-
national terrorist groupe to prevent Chris.
tians from serving the Lord. Christian Ac.
tion will also continue giving people like
you, Ms Lister, the opportunity to meet eye
to eye with genuine Christians who per.
sonally experienced how Swapo and their
allies persecuted people who refused to ac-
cept and support an anti-Christian ideology
We will go to extreme efforts to show how
false certain ‘clergymen’ and their imitators
are in their preservation of basic human
rights You, Ms Lister, know that we are
referring among others to the socalled
‘Swapo 100"". You yourself have appealed to
Swapo to give these people a fair trial, and
to advise their next-of-kin and to permit
legal representation for these people. You
Ms Lister, have done this, but noclergyman
has made such an appeal.

There are many more aspects that Chris-
tian Action will convey to you and the in.
habitants of this country. You will be plac-
ed on our mailing list in future. We do,
however, reapect the feelings of every per.
son, and enjorse the Charter of Fundamen.
tal Rights as is expected of true Christians,
and therefore don’t mind if you ignore our
newsletter. You know that the truth often
hurts. Don't fear that Christian Action will
force anybody to accept what we say. We tell
what we know. Christian Action does not in-
timidate. Christian Action does not require
anybody to move from door to door to
threaten people will death ifthey will not ac-
cept what westand for. Christian Action will
not plant mines, or plant bombs in butcher
shope and service stations, or destroy the
homes of innocent people with explosives.
Christian Action will also not call on
clergymen to open their churches to
political parties and socalled freedom
fighters so that they can promote heresy.

No, Ms Lister, we champion peace. We
serve the Lord, and we will continue tofight
and to get politics out of the churches and

Colonel Radmore, and references toor-

on behalf of certain instances. You may
well serve the Lord, but you serve the

correspondence of your organisation,
you also claim that you are able to |
monitor the comings and goings of
clergymen at military bases, which
would seem to indicate you convenient
ly use your SADF affiliation in your

‘Christian Action’ propaganda.

Presumably also, in “fighting to get
politics out of the churches and the
churches out of politics” you target the
Dutch Reformed Church as well as the
Council of Churches groupings. But I
doubt that. Yours is a highly selective
morality.

and Mr Yates were given ample oppor-

You neglected to do this. To demand that
we put questions in writing to be
discussed at some future meeting is not
standard practice followed by
reputable journalists. I have found in
my lengthy journalism career(army in-

people who make these sort of requests
are usually attempting to conceal or

evade the issue.

In conclusion: I have published the
letter in full so the public can judge for
themselves (ifthey are able to figure out)
what your organisation represents. I
myself cannot establish who you are
and what you are trying to do, except to
join the chorus of anti-Swapo pro-
pagandists, this time in the guise of a
religious front. Prove to us otherwise.
Condemn the reported security force
atrocities: inform us when you decide to
have a public meeting, which you have
not done to date; and prove to us your

In struggle

] WOULD like to refer toan announce-
ment in a recent radio programme
stating that churchleaders should not
be involved in politics. Why is thisthe
case?

Obviously churchleaders are our
guides in the struggle. They are the
ones who can truly solve problems,
especially regarding the “beatings
and torture” by Koevoet in northern

Namibia.

Churchleaders must be involved in
politics because they are true
peacelovers of Namibia who are strug-
gling for peace and freedom; because
they love their people and country, they
must try to defend their people by tell-

AN OPEN LETTER TO
DR JORDAAN

TAKE note that the people of Otjimb.-
ingwe have for the last couple of years
noted critically the undesirable
medical care service that your health
department offers to our People here,
and demanded drastic changes (see at-
tached petition).

However, after almost a month your
department seems virtually incon-
siderate towards the rotten medical
service andthe lives ofthe people your
government claims to protect and
govern. To be sure, your department
has not moved even aninch torespond
to the demands of the people Dr
Wagner continues still, and the State
clinic is not yet Properly equipped.

So, if these conditions remain, we",Namibia.,"clinic is not yet Properly equipped.So, if these conditions remain, we"

The authors would do well to
emulate Dr Perez de Cuellar’s honest
concern on these points instead of echo-
ing Swapo's hoary ploy of pointing to
“South African partiality” as a means
of diverting attention from them. All
thinking Namibians know by now that
South Africa - like any country - is
focuasing on the protection of its own
interests, not those of any Namibian
party. The recent contreternps between
the Administrator General and the
Cabinet following Mr Pienaar's
speech, serves to underline this.

The fact that South Africa's interesta
are not at stake here, probably explains
why that government formally aban.
doned its demand for UN impartial.
ty in August 1983. The fact that our in.
terests are at stake explains why
Namibian parties who do not enjoy the
benefits of UN bias, continue to make
this demand.

Why press for negotiation and
reconciliation before  in-
dependence? Because this is the on-
ly way in which political compromise,

peace, stability and a decent shot at
cconomic prosperity and national
reconstruction can be achieved in
Namibia.

The simple fact iathat negotiations
between Swapo and South Africa or
between other Namibian parties and
South Africa, will not achieve this. It
can only be achieved in negotiations
between Namibians capousing dif.
fereint views.

We understand why Swapo wishes to
Sign aceasefire agreement with South
Africa and why it does not. wish to
negotiate with other Namibian par.
ties. By signing a ceasfire with South
Africa, Swapo will guin prestige and
will be seen as the winner

In struggle

1 WOULD like to refer to an announce.
ment in a recent radio programme
stating that churchleadersshauld nct
be involved in politica. Why isthiathe
case?

Obviously churchleadera are our
guides in the struggle. They are the
onee who can truly solve problema,
especially regarding the “beatings
and torture” by Koevoet in northern
d

past eight years. And how could it be
otherwise, when thoes arguments -just
asthe authors accuse those whom they
attack of doing - gloss over or sidestep
uncomfortable facts and bend reality
to suit their limited purposes.

Toturn instead to a few substantive

points raised in the text:
Why a Constitution before elec-
tions? So that you know what you are
going to get. A constitution is the
skeleton of a country’s political
system; the set of parameters within
which the political contest between
parties espousing different ap-
proaches, is regulated. Constitutions
reflect common values, not the
political preferences of a (temporary)
mapority.

Building on the constitutional prin.
ciples and guidelines of the Western
Five - adopted at the instance of the
much-maligned Reagan Administra.
tion - set out in Annexure J to the
NPP-435 study, all that 1s necessary
now, is to agree on a constitution em-
bodying these principles, before
elections.

Can the members of NPP-435 really
be so gullible as to wish to rely on the
possibility that Swapo - a most
undemocratic organisation, as all
Namibians with any experience of it
know - wil] abide by abstract principles
limiting its power, if it is under no
obligation to do so.

Constitutions, in setting limits on
the freedom of majorities to work their
unfettered will on others in society, are
the best guarantee of civilised govern-
ment yet developed. They are best con.
structed so as to be acceptable - as the
rulesof the political game - toal]in any
national society, not just to a tem-
porary majority. Perhaps this is the
point the authors have missed.
Exeuse of UN Partiality The pro-
tagonists of the present arrangements
in the UN are often least comfortable
when addressing this point.

The facts are that SWAPO has been
declared repeatedly since 1973, by the
Genera! Assembly, tobe the ‘sole and
authentic representative of the people
of Namibia’. As a consequence of this

and other actions of the Assembly, it
enjoys the status of ‘permanent
observer’ throughout the UN system.

Those who have had the opportuni.
ty todiscussing these matters with UN
Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, can testify to his personal
discomfort and embarrassment at the
A dilemma

AN OPEN LETTER to the
Executive Committee of NPP-435
concerning the booklet entitled
The Choice: Namibia Peace Plan
435 or Society under Siege

THE conscientious reviewer of this
weighty essay is confronted with
several dilemmas. Is the pamphlet in-
tended, as its authors suggest in the
to“... present Namibians with
the facts ... and thus to provide them
with with the opportunity of assessing
for themselves the situation and to
draw their own conclusions..."" or isit.
as the authors claim, only three
paragraphs lower on the same page “.
to strengthen the commitment of (cer.
tain) churches, parties and groups to
the immediate implementation of
Security Council Resolution 435""

Is it intended toconstitute anal ysis
Or advocacy? The compilers seem
undecided.

Are the authors, ifthey intend to pro-
vide a dispassionate analysis, naive or
disingenuous? If they intend to ad-
vocate a cause, are they merely in-
competent or do they underestimate
the intelligence of their readers?

ps the most distressing factor

of the work is that, despite its gran.
diose claims, exotic style and partisan
tone - even the Namibian Chamber of
is roundly chastised for

having the temerity to seek to have
Namibia excluded from sanctions
against South Africa -it breaks no new
ground. The arguments are al)
familiar, even tired. They, and
numerous others like them - often
more elegantly and persuasively ex.
pressed - have failed to resolve this
dispute, to stop the killing, to bring
Namibians toone another, in the
pest eight years. And how could it be

Reply to Kozo

WE HAVE read, with interest, a letter
received from Minister Kozonguizi
typed on a letterhead of the Depart
ment of Information, indicated that
even such letters are done at the tax
payer's expense

Minister Kozonguizi’s epistle is
what hecallsa “review” ofour booklet

“The Choice - Namibia Peace Plan
435 or Socrety under Siege”

The booklet attempts to present
Namibians with the facts and by the
proviston of these facts and the
analysts of these facts, to strengthen
the commitment of ali these who call
for immediate impiementation of
Resolution 435 of 1975

Itconstitutes analysis as weil asad

Minister and all those institutions,
parties. groups, persons and

It presents the truth in rebuttal of
the propaganda daily poured out for
Mr Kozonyuizi s cause and financed by
millions. if not billions of Rand from
the pockets of the South African and
Namibia taxpayers, andin the case of
Namibia without the consent of the
taxpayers and without the consent of
Namibians

quately in our booklet and readers are
referred to it

We can all agree thata constitution
isone ofthe most important pillars of
a stable democratic state -1f not the
very foundationof it, But surely such
an important basic document must
represent the will of the people of
Namuibra otherwise it will have to be
imposed andthenit will not be worth
the paper on which it is written To
represent the will of the people, it
follows that only truly elected
representatives of the people can
represent the will of the people

Andtoelect such representatives of
the people who will thendraw upacon
stitution for Namibia. in the exercise
of their self-determination and right
to independence, 1s the very aim and
essence of Resolution 435 of 1978

After the constitution so drawn up by
the elected representatives, there
could be a further election forthe first
government of Namibia in terms ofthe
agreed constitution That willineffect
meanaconstitution before anclection
for a Namibian government

In the case of Namibia. however.
there already exists an international
ayreement.on the inclusion of certain
specified constitutional principles and
fundamental human rights in the
future constitution of Namibia and
also safeguards for the protection of
minorities in the form ofa provision for
proportional representation and for
the further details of the constitution
to be decided upon by at least a two
thirds majority

So itis clear that even here a com-
promise hus already been reached
between those who want a constitution
first and those who want an election
before a constitution

Swapo hasconsistently stood by the
peace plan and the democratic elec:
tions provided for in it, whereas
Minister Kozonguiz:. Minister
Shipanga and others show no sign of
suggesting anv sort of country-wide
elections to legitimise their appoint
ments by the SA Government Have
vou redefined democracy, Minister
Kozonguizi? If 30, please let the ‘in
telligent” readers have vour definition
and your government's planof action
for democracy. self-determination and
internationally recognised
independence.

If vour vague allegations ayainst
Swapo ure trut, you should welcome
elections in termsof Resolution 435 of
1978 because then vou can attack and
denigrate Swapo in their presence in
front of the Namibian people The
peace plan provides for the return of al!
refugees and one can imayine the
many witnesses then becoming
available to substantiate these
charges. iftrue, Why miss such an ex
cellent opportunity to free the tortured
refayees and confront Swape face to

seem to be three (1) capitulation » by

negotiation - tn the hope that the SA
Government may modify its position
which would amount to capitulation:
(Srindifference inthe hope thatother
countries, other powers, may take up
their struggle and attain freedom for
them. None of these, especially the first,
seems very likely

The fourth 1s armed struggle
whichis alwayseasier todiscuss than
toplan, easertoorganise than to carry
out, for it must be pursued with
ruthless determination to win and
it must be reinforced by a principl-
ed dedication to the cause. From
thier public pronouncements, iLseems
clear that the leaders of South West
Africa are moving in the direction of
armed struggle”

ft appears that the Honourable
Minister has since 1966 accepted the
firstoption above viz “Capitulation. ”

What basis do Namibians have for
beheving that the interim government
willabide by whatever constitution it
might draw up, when itis responsible
tonoclectorate having never faced an
election?

Excuse of UN Partiality: We
acknowledge tn our booklet the fact of
UN partiality, but we explain whys it
will not have any effect on the judge
ment of Namibians ina 445 election
But why don't you acknowledge South
Africa’s partiality? Why not?

The Honourable Minister of Justice
has often inthe past reiterated thatin
Africa power comes from the barrel ot
agun, and we suspect that he and some
of his associates have accepted this
credo.

It seems futile to argue with the
Minister about free and fair elections
Ifinterested in elections at all.it will
have to be elections which he can be
guaranteed to win- and free and fair
elections are unlikely to lead to that
result

I WISH to air my disappointment
about the issue of permits to the
travelling public between Rundu and
the Caprivi.

Fellow Namibians, it hurts tosee the
travelling public suffering likethey do
inthe country of their birth. Ever since
the introduction of the issue of permits
by the SADF eight years ago, it seems
that Namibians are not much concern-
ed about it.

The permits in question is not a
statutory law ofthecountry butrather
an imaginary law introduced by the ar-
my to cause severe hardship to Capri-
vians and the travelling public.

The army should immediately and
unconditionally do away with the issue
of permits, for if not, Namibians will
be left with nooption than tochallenge
the validity of the permits in acourt of
law. Members of the travelling public
are checked and their clothing left in
the dust road, after every 50km stretch
from Bagani to Kongola.

A poor Caprivian motorist with his
family, was travelling from Katima
Mulilo to Windhoek and at the
Kongola army checkpoint was ordered
todrive 120km back to Katima to have
his provision of fish written on the
socalled permit. He had torefill hiscar
with petrol for a second time although
the permit in question does not
stipulate the inclusion of provisions of
any kind. Though you are in possession
of the permit, it does not offer you pro-
tection of any kind, because it is
stipulated that youtravel at yourown
risk. What is the use of carrying
something that does not give you any
protection? What is the use of iden-
tification cards issued to Namibians
and residents? The behaviour of Up-
ingtonians and people trom the Cape
is intolerable and they must be sent
back to where they came from.

I appeal to all peaceloving church
organisations, progressive political
parties, and Namibiansboth and
white, to stand up and apeak out
against the issue of permits between
Rundu and Caprivi. .

As a member of Swapo anda Youth

How onearthcan they gointoa place

Security forces blame Swapo for us-

We are not all children and cannot be
fooled. Perhaps those in the Tinten-

not us.

The subsequent police press con-
ference was a total distortion of the
truth. There the police claimed that
“we have no knowledge of any assaults
committed by members of the police or
security force members during the
operation. That is rubbish and we have
evidence that people such as Linus
Shipingana and others were assaulted
while looking at police from the cor-

awakened.

I also wish to condemn in the
strongest of terms the confiscation of

can they confiscate things like knives

these things, and nobody needs a per-

Windhoek.

It is our plea for those peace-loving
Namibians to try and look at the
political struggle with some common
sense.

Many people, especially members of
Swapol, also known as Koevoet, seem
to believe that physical violence will
change our views as Namibians in this

I and two comrades, living in the

by drunk membersof Swapol on April

Why do members of these forces at-

appointed to maintain law and order

Are they trained in the right way? Or
are they trained to hit and kick inno-

us against trespassers of the law?

It seems that many of those people
are cowardly rather than brave, and
this is why they attack innocent
civilians rather than delinquents.

Whatever they do, apartheid will one
day be abolished and the racist, apar-
theid followers in our country, should
be given their own ‘homeland’ where
they can do their own things.

We are not against the different

They should remember that we are

On anti-Swapo

ON JUNE 9, I received anonymous
anti-Swapo literature. I have learned
that the literature has ‘»een circulated
tomany people who are suspected ofbe-
ing members of Swapo in the Kavango.

What surprised me is that this
literature is the act of a coward, since
the documentation is not attributed or
named. The literature is full of mixed
texts extracted from various unknown
newspapers accompanied by a poor
Rukwangali version. It is also full of
anti-Nujoma statements such as ‘Nu-
joma het geslaan’, and ‘Vuishou 'n
akok’, to mention but a few.

Some Swapo executives in Kavango
were warned about what they were do-
ing. There is also a page of pictures of
eight people, probably emanating from
the socalled Parents Committee, with
question marks. These eight people
are those they believe have been ex-
semted by the movement.

According to news reports around
25 000 people are benefiting from an
emergency feeding scheme. The
Department of National Health and
Welfare, and private welfare organiza-
tions, like the Red Crogs are involved.
While having sympathy with
hungry people, and supporting the ef:
forts to help, we have to ask ourselves,
“Why are these people starving”. The
following problems are contributing to
the problem viz:
A) Population Growth:
The annual population growth hovers
around three percent. Fifty percentof
the population is 15 years or younger,
and therefore unproductive. Between
© to 10 percent are retired and no
longer make a contribution. Present-
ly only 20 percent ofthe population are
gainfully economically employed, and
of this group, one quarter works for the
State. The balance 20-25% are either
subsistence farmers or unemployed.
The population growth ou tstrips
food production, housing resources,
schooling, Health services and job crea-
tion. As @ result the population
becomes poorer and poorer, and the
economically active group smaller in
proportion. It is always tempting in an
effort toredistribute wealth, to heavi-
ly tax this group. Care must however
be taken not tokill the goose that lays
the golden eggs.
B) Drought:
Namibia isasemi-desert country and
droughts are part of life. The problem
arises when the odd few good rainfal]
years are taken asthe norm and no pro-
vision is made for the inevitable bad
years in nature's cycle.
C) Farming Methods:
Farming methodsaresometimes very
destructive, especially in the com-
munal areas. There, no rotation graz-
ing is implemented and very little con-
trol is exercised over stock numbers.
Traditionally the number of cattle iB
a symbol of wealth, irrespective of their
condition. Owners are alsooften loathe
to sell their cattle, even in times of
drought, with resultant destruction of
grazing and death, as witnessed a few
years ago in Kaokoveld. The result ig
the same as in the Sahel region in
North Africa. Man has totally upset
the delicate balance of nature for short
term gain, with longterm destructive
results, |

D) Guerrilla War: | |

‘| avesult ofthe political uncertaintyiand —
BVO US SO

-D) Guerrilla War:

The war, especially in Owambo, con-
tributes tothe misery ofthe locals. As
-aresult ofthe political uncertainty and
‘lack of international recognition, in-
vestments are not readily made in
‘Namibia, with resultant meagre job
creation. The spill-over of the war in
Angola, streches our limited resources
with refugees.

E) Good Medica! Services:

As a result of good medical services
more people survive in an otherwise
often hostile environment. There isa
sense of fatalism and the beliefthat the
State will provide for all needs. This 1s
often demanded as a right which the
State has to satisfy. Unfortunately this
demand is not matched by responsibil.
ty or contribution. In order to try and
solve the problem, and to avoid an
ecological and biological disaster, the
problem must be tackled with political
will.

A) Population Planning:

Namibia isnyt arichcountry. Many of
its resources are transient cy.
diamonds(CDM), base minerals(TC1.),
uranium (Rossing), gas(KUDU), and
gold(Karibib). When the mines close,
this source of income is gone. The
resources remaining will be farming,
fishing, tourism and human. If the
human resource is planned and nur.

tured it will be the most important.

One Just has to look at Japan, a coun-
try with virtually no natura!
resources, but an incredible human
resource.

Due to the population explosion,
China has taken drastic steps aiming
at one child per family. Parents who
want more will have to pay and forfeit
free services and free schooling. This
may sound very radical but one hasto
he cruel to be kind. The alternative is
another Ethiopia. Here the initial
worldwide enthusiasm and Bob
eldoft waned as 400n as the TV im.
ages faded and aid mismanay
became known gement

Population planning can also not be
seen in the white/black political con-
text. Already blacks outnumber
whites by more than twelve to one.
Whether it is two to one or 12 to one
makes no difference in aone-manone-

~
*
vote election. Therefore population
planning as a form of imperialistic,
capitalistic, racial suppression, has no
logical or scientific basis.

With the present growth curve,
demands on health, housing, food,
education andemployment, are in ex:
cess of supply, and the situation is
worsening. Demand greater than
supply boosts inflation, whichinturn
aggravates poverty even further. It is
a vicious cycle. Only a firm political
statement of intent and action, can
break this cycle. It will require a brave
man to doit, but if successfull, he will
go down in history as the man who
brought progress and prosperity. Peo-
ple will become independent of, rather
than dependent on the State.

B) Farming Methods:

Farming methods must become scien-
tificand conservative. Namibia is vir-
tually only suited to livestock and
game farming. The delicate ecological
symbiosis must be nurtured for future
generations.

C) Political Settlement

’ (AG8 and Resolution 435):

The guerrilla war can only be ter-
minated by a political settlement. It is
often said that Namibia must decide
its own future, but to most who have
followed the political yo-yo game, it is
obvious that outside sources from a
number of sides are manipulating our
future. A settlement will hopefully
bring peace, stability, investment and
prosperity.

D) Good Medical Services:

Good medical services must gohandin |
hand with education and economic ©
progress.

E) Political Independence:

Political independence depends on
economic independence. Namibia’s
resources must be developed by Nami-
bians for Namibia, with help if
necessary. Presently symptoms and
not causes are treated. This only
postpones a solution until it becomes
insurmountable.

Man has been able to control all
other formsofliebut not himself. One
of the few people still inharmony with
nature is the Kalahari bushman. He
sets anexcellentexampleofliveand let
live, unlike the suicidal lemmings of
the Antarctic.

You don't help a poor man by giving
him a fish, but by showing him how to
catch a fish. The aim should be in-
dependence not hand-out nurtured
dependence.

I WISH to express my point of view con-
cerning the recent visit of high-
ranking South African Government
Ministers to Namibia. One wonders
why they do this because it has no
meaning for Namibians. Isit possible
that South Africa’s Defence Minister
could concern himself with the Con-
stitutional Council?

Did they come here to talk about the
real situation in Namibia, or did they
come to give instructions to their
pawns in the interim government? Did
they come to re-inforce the curfew
restrictions? What is the purpose of
protecting a minority when they
disregard the wishes of the majority?

Namibians are suffering daily, long-
ing for independence, crving for self-
determination and implementation of
Resolution 435; but our humandigni-
ty is detrimentally affected by the
socalled SA DF and SWATF. the latter
created illegally in our country.

lfeeltheir visit was a provocation to
the oppressed people of Namibia, and
those who welcomed them here must
be people who have lost interest in
Namibian affairs.

Let SA leave Namibia in peace; let
them give the Namibians what they
want and forget about creating confu-
sion with an appointed, unrecognised
government which works under SA
control.

Their daily Afrikaans language
mouthpiece. instead of exposing the
realities, hinders the truth and
misleads the people. This propaganda
has no benefit toour nation. Why don't

Swapo has been willing to sign an ar-

ALLOW ME to respond to the letter
published in The Namibia of July 10,
entitled ‘Coward Lister.

First I would like to inform Mr
Mungunda and his Union that Lister
| ig a fair and honest editor. The weekly
paper, The Namibian, 1s presenting
the true facts of what is happening in
thiscountry. The Namibian is the on-
ly real newspaper in Namibia which
prints the truth about the country.

Lister did not berate and insult the
| HYereros as you alleged. The paper
revealed to the public the ungodly
| work of the Nudo members Itis self-
evident that Nudo members and their
‘bishops’ are South African proxies,
who are used by the colonial govern
ment to disrupt meetings af pro-
gressive forces and character:
aysassinate Swapo members and
supPOrle;rs.

Donot misjudge Lister or accuse her
falsely. We the public know of your dir-
ty tricks.

Worst of all, you claimed that your
Union (Namibian Churches Union)is
a ‘truly Christian body’ Your letter
had nice terminology but lacked reah-
ty and is confronted with countless
dilemmas. a
Your letter covered the true core
nature of the Union and ameared the

true Christian churchea and peace-

loving poople by depicting them as
cr

comic characters of political puppet
shows. Mr Mungunda, you failed to
check your facts before you picked up
a pen,

Yo can't call your Union a ‘truly
Christian body’ when it stated that
“we have no political prisoners, no
state of emergency. We have the right
of assembly and freedom of speech’

Against thisbackground your Union
proved itself anti-Christian and
anti-humaneneas.

Today we live under the ungodly
system of apartheid, which is devour.
ing the Namibian children, but your
‘truly Christian body’ stated that
‘human rights are being carried out
through the government on the basis
ofour BillofRights’” Onthecontrary,
on July 5, Swapo supporters were
beaten upon their way toa Swaporal-
ly and an eight-year-old gir) allegedly
beaten by police. Is this what your
Union refer to as ‘freedom of speech
and the right of assembly’.

In the north our people live under the
agony of horror and death. Church pro-
pertios are destroyed daily Isthishow
human rights are guaranteed by the
BillofRights? Here again your Union
provedclearly tobe the mouthpiece of
the interim government. All the socall-
ed ‘bishops’ appear to be DTA
members.

The ‘truly Christian body’ also
KLated that Swapo is not banned, but
today Swapo supporters and “sym.
pathisers ure the victims of Koevoet,
police and Nude vigilantes, who are in
the pay of the colonial government.
Then again you stated that Swapo
should not hire political priests to
negotiate surrender,

Swapo is a Namibian liberation
movement formed by the oppressed —
Namibians as a result of colonial.
racist, draconian laws imposed on
them.

Swapo is the uppressed people and
the oppressed people are Swapo And
the CCN Bishops are part and parce|
of the oppressed Namibians. They are
commilted Christians who are Dro.
Claiming the true Rospel of peace and
justice. They are not money
mongerers They are doing their dut \
as Christians ina society which is torn

by the evil of apurtheid and colonial
oppression.
Then vour Chiech Tle... so
‘Then your Church Union called on
the international cummunity to in-
fluence Swapo to free the socalled
prisoners kept ‘in holesinthe ground
by Swapoin Angola’ It may be true, but
why do you also not appeal to South
Africa to release allthe prisonersheld
under Proclamations AG 9 and 26? In
the north civilians are dying at the
hands of Koevoet and others, Where
are you in this regard?

Dear priests of NCU, don't turn a ho-
ly church intoa business game. Don't
mislead your Christian congregations
The time hag come for you to join the
real struggle

Lastly, Mungunda pointed out that
Swapo should surrender, | wish to
point out to him that the Namibian
struggle is a just struggle, precipitated
by South Africancolonial oppression.
Resistance will be there as long asthe

THERE IS a considerable number of
Namibians who really do not unders-
tand the historical process through
which we are going, particularly with
regard to the armed struggle against
the colonial occupation of this country
by the SA regime. The socalled Verip1
Mungunda is one of them.

In his letter dated July 17, he made
serious, irresponsible and reactionary
statements. Inthe first one, he alleges
that Swapo has no popular supporter.
1, the writer of this letter, would like to
challenge him to travel through the
country and test the popular support
of Swapo by questioning the masseson
the credibility of Swapoasa liberation
movement. If he did this, he would
definitely clear out his brainwashed
mind.

As far as his second statement iscon-
cerned; which implies that Swapo
makes use of the Council of Churches
and Namibian facilities in order to
carry out its political activities, my
question is: is their anything wrong
with it? Is it wrong for peace loving peo-
ple and genuine Namibiansto gather
together, to thrash out the good from
the bad? No, Mr Mungunda. Once
again, you're confused. In the Nami-

‘bian context the CCN and The Nami-

bian’s Editor forms the good, while the
alliance between the Namibia Chur-
ches Union(NCU)and Nudo, form the
bad.

The latter is a grouping on tribal
lines to delay the process to freedom.
Andatill you deliberately come out in
support of those people who are in-
directly responsible for the atrocities
committed against innocent people in

the truth.

On 22-7-1987, the chairman of a

Nicolas Winterton, spoke over the col-
onial Radio Owambo, and expressed
dissatisfaction with the bomb explo-
sion in Windhoek a few weeks ago. He
said that the Swapo office in London
should be closed down because that
organization did a bad thing by plan-
ting the bomb.

Mr Winterton I want to know
whether you have certainty that the
bomb was in fact planted by Swapo.
Real proof is what I need.

Mr Winterton, you say that you are
are feeling bad about the bomb in
which no one lost their lives, and
already you want the office of
Namibia's true freedom fighters tobe
closed down. A real pity.

In the meanwhile you ignore the
despicable misdeeds which are being
committed by South Africa. For exam-
ple, Mrs Alina Shilongo’s house which
was destroyed by South Africa’s
Casspirs on 3-7-1987. That was the
house of an aged woman of 80 years.
Should it have been your grandmoyner,
what would you say?. Give an an4ver —
to that. Of course you are not feeling |
any disquiet because her skin is

Africa's apartheid is wanted here in
Namibia.

You must be happy about what your
friend, South Africa, has done by
shooting and killing an innocent
schoolgirl.(Laina Trapopi, 8-7-1987).

And now you are saying that Swapo
has committed a misdeed, and its of-
fices in London should be closed.

In that case, would you ask that
South Africa’s ‘offices’ be closed down
in Namibia? Should they close because
of what is happening here? Or is your

last year a beautiful complex, a

The black community complains

only painkillers and Panado are

because of this.

Old-type toilets are still in use inthe

Those who die rest in peace, but the few

you have to pay R10 a month. The
rooms are not private and are divided
with 1,5m walls in the middle.

| LAM a: member of Swanu and I wag
- shigeked when Comrade Sama Nujoma
said ina recent interview published in
The Namibian that Swapo wouldallow
whites to keep their farmsin Namibia
and that they would use only some
uninhabited parts of Namibia for
cooperative projects. Are we tostick to
the Namib Desert and Khomas
Hochland with our ‘cooperative’ pro-
jects a la socialism? Not at all.

The grand children of Maharero,
Mandume and Witbooi are still wag-
ing the war against the racist South
African Government to regain their
land. There must be noquestion about
it. Our forebears gave their lives in
defence of our land and the present
generation is also sacrificing their
lives to regain the land from the white
oppressors. As long as our land re-
mains in the hands of the present
white monopoly farmers, there can be
and there will be no peace and stabili-
ty in Namibia.

The questionofland isa very serious
matter which lies at the heart of our
struggle. The whites will continue to
control our economy ifthey retain the
land and our freedom will be in name
only ... something like the MPC is
claiming today. That will be a sham
freedom within poverty, white domina-
tion and exploitation of our wealth.
Such independence is definitely not
worth fighting for.

We must fight for the land and all our
natural resources. I believe that thisis
the only solution for the black majori-
ty of Namibians. The whites are still
controlling thefarms and the economy
in Zimbabwe and those who fought
during the war are not satisfied at pre-
sent. The Zimbabwean government is
trying to solve this problem which |
realise is a very difficult task at this
stage. This is why in the case of
Namibia we must grab our in-
dependence in terms ofthe ownership
of land. We must show to have learned
the lessonsof African history. The land
belongs tothe people of Africa and not
to those who call themselves ‘Euro-
peans’ in Namibia.

We cannot promise our sacred land
to the very same white farmers who
support the all-apartheid white Na-
tional Party of settlers in Namibia. We
cannot give our land to those who, in
the May 6 elections this year, return-
ed P W Botha to powerinordertopro-
tect their minority rights in Namibia.
We cannot give our land to white
farmers who train Koevoet and who
are themselves commando members
in the South African army.

Since whites do not compromise on
any issue so far, why should we com-
promise our birthright? The masses of
our people shall take over the land
from the white monopoly capitalists
with or without compensation.

I WOULD like to express my views
regarding the socalled Owambo an-

nouncers in the services of the

SWABC’s Radio Owambo service. |

..L] These announcers are blinded and
misled by South Africa not to see the
realitiesoftheconditionsin Namibia.
They are used as instruments by SA to
promote its interests andcolonialism
in Namibia.
_] They represent a Corporation
(SWABC) which is parastatal and fur.
thers the ethnic dispensation in
Namibia.
\! They are used to broadcast the
deaths of freedom fighters in such a
way that it causes panic, wrath and
hatred amongthe peace-loving Nami-
bians. They appear to keep silent on
the deaths in units such as SA DF,
SWATF and Koevoet. Furthermore
they urge people to believe the latter
suffer no casualties.
i: Female announcersare guilty ofthe
same things.
i. Most of these announcers have
become resident in the towns of
Oshakati and Ondangua and hardly
visit their places or origin. They are
fully disconnected from the nation. If
they are on a reporting mission, then
they are given an army escort.
[| They are used to promote the in.
terests of multinational corporations
in Namibia, by urging people to buy
their products such as liquor and
cigarettes, but neglect to urge the na-
tion regarding education, health and
agriculture.
) Prominent occurrences of national!
interest are never broadcast by this
service. Acts of repression and brutali-
ty by the security forces in Namibia are
never broadcast.
[1 They are used to promote the ac-
tivities of SADF, SWATF Etango in
northern Namibia, and perhaps they
are even members of some of these
organisations.
(| They are always pro-Unita, inva-
sions into Angola, Renamoin Mozam-
bique, and are anti-East (USSR and
alles), anti-African, and oppased to
leaders such as Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, Peter Kalangula and Justus
Garoeb.
se
iO They refer to statements by
Kwautima, Nghixulifa and Dan re-
questing the SADF to stay on in
Namibia, and repeatedly broadcast
such statements.

themselves to be used as mouthpieces
of propaganda against their own

Saluting Ponhofi

I WOULD like to air my views on the
socalled leaders of Uukwanyamr’sre-
centcal for army reinforcement inthe
region.

In the first place, I would like to
salute my comrades, fellow students of
Ponhofi Secondary School, who called
upon the SADF to withdraw from the
region, in particular the Ovambo Ad.
ministration and many other victims
of the racist Pretoria regime.

Inthe second place I would like to in.
form Messrs Kwautima, Dan and
Nghihulifwa and their disciples inthe
region that we want freedom and not
an extension and intensification of up.
Ppreesion and victimisation as is the
case in the north Presently. If Mr

Kwautima genuinely wants freedom
and security then he should fight for
the implementation of Resolution 435.

Itseems thatthe menin question do
not know what Resolution 435 is. They
simply believe that Koevoet will bring
stability in the region.

If Kwautima, Nghihulifwa and their
followers cannot exist without the ar-
my and Koevoet, then they should go
together with them, and leave Nami-
brans in peace.

Kwautima claimed over Radio
Owambo that even Chief Mandume
had soldiers. This may be, but Man-
dume did not fight his fellow Nami-
bians but fought the same colonialism
which we Namibians are fighting
against today. How can Kwautima
compare himself with a man like
Mandume?

Whatever Kwautima does. he and
his followers will never win the people's
hearts and minds. Students of Ponhofi,
you must not be intimidated by these
people. You must not surrender your
attitude of resistance tothe SADF We
are al] with you and behind you.

We shall not be intimidated by South
African surrogates and their puppets.
The army and Koevoet must pack up
and go.

a to be honest andseriousinour
relationship with each other. I had no
reason to doubt your intentions tocom-
municate with me in a mature man-
ner. I however intend to keep to our
bargain and refrain from being per-
sonal and cynical.

1. You can stop being presumptuous.
My promotion had nothing what-
goever to do with our relationship or
with my correspondence with The
Namibian.

proud to be a member of that Branch.
3 You will be surprised to learn that
my colleagues and I have had an avid
interest in the compound system for
more than 12 years. We have been
deliberating and negotiating with
numerous instances and governments
to abolish this system. The main
reasons, amongst others, where toen-
sure that those people who worked and
lived far from their home and their
families shouldbe given the chance to
live in peace and tranquility and
should not be controlled by Swapo’s
henchmen through intimidation and
victimisation. Secondly, we were con-
vinced that the majority of those
workers were honest people who
desired to be employed and to earn
enough money to support their
families, but that they inevitably
became, directly or indirectly, involv-
ed in the conflict between criminals
and the police.

4. If you or anybody else is seriously in-
terested to find out what if means to
live ina compound, I will be glad toar-
range a meeting with people who knew
the situation and whocan inform you
of the truth. I will ensure that you will
not be lied toor mislead by people who
profess to know the situation, but who
were never interested in the people liv-
ing in the compound.

once in the past few months, and you
have reported these statements, that
the Katutura compound is the first to

ing people will be disposed with. My
colleagues and I do maintain an avid
interest in these projects too.

go and that all similar systemsof hous.
ing people will be disposed with. My
colleagues and I do maintain an avid

6. I do agree with you that there is
understanding for the argument con-
cerning practical implications of
destroying such a structure, as the
compound, built at such a cost. Con-
trary to you and a few others who
started makingnoisesonly a few days
ago about the destiny of the compound,
J was involved in and am aware of
many, Many options which were con-
sidered to maintain the structures of
the Katutura compound, but none
seemed feasible. The TGNU andother
responsible institutions and bodies
have repeatedly requested contribu-
tions toensure an acceptable future for
the structure.

7. The most important aspect which
you and other people wantonly forget
when criticising the government is
that thousandsof people are involved.
My colleagues in the SWA Police are
aware of the plight of those who lived
in compounds. That is why we did not
criticise or protest in public, but we
_became actively involved in finding a
solution. A solution not to our own pro-
blems, but a solution for those honest
and law-abiding citizens who could not
escape being intimidated by terrorists
and victimised by criminals while liv-
inginacompound. -

8. In the last edition of The Namibian
you reported extensively of the com-
plaints of two men who voluntarily
bought houses. You will be unjuat to
your readers if you do not interview one
or more of those hundreds of men who
are overjoyed with the opportunity to
have their own homes which they can
afford and in which they can stay with
their families without any in-
terference. You will] not regret a visit
to Hakahana and you willexperience
something beautiful inthe joy of those
workers who are united with their
families.

I am proud to have made a concrete
contribution, no matter how small it
was, to the destruction ofthe Katutura
compound and to allow my coun-
trymen to otcupy an own home
together with their families. I know
that these menand their families will
eventually have the peace they desired
andthatthey will graspthe opportunt-
ty tocontribute to mutual respect and
understanding 1n our country.

I have never before experienced so
much affirmation for my beliefs as on
Friday afternoon when thousands of
my fellow countrymen witnessed the
destruction of the compound with joy
and satisfaction. The small
demonstration by insecure people who
were deserted by the organisers,
helped toemphasise the majority ofthe
people who want positive changes
which contribute toa stable future for
our country and its people.

Please publish this letter.

sincere citizen of this country.

camp because the SA regime are
building up the military in our coun:

their brothers and sisters. The SADF

attacks on our neighbouring states. IN
northern Namibia the SADF and
Koevoet units are committing
atrocities against innocent civilians in
Various Ways.

The Botha regime are not ready to
sign a ceasefire with Swapo to bring
about peace, democracy and economic
stability in southern Africa. The
Botha government also wants to top-
ple the MPLA in Angola and install
the Unita puppets, as they have done
in Namibia.

Inhuman and draconian laws have
been forced on the people of this coun-
try; particularly the oppressed black
mapority: I refer to the curfew regula.
tions in northern Namibia; the check-
point at Oshivello where blacks are il].
treated by the notorious Koevoet:
refusal of passports to progressive
leaders; Proclamations AG 26, 9 and
Section 6 of the Terrorism Act interms
of which police have Virtually
unlimited powers.
The SA government is also engaged
in the indoctrination of Namibians:
organisations like Etango, Ezuva,
Namwi Foundation and Ichtus are
there to mislead, confuse and distort
the truth of the liberation struggle.
Etango, the socalled religiouscultural
group rules with the Bible andthe gufn.
Has no-one told these organisations
that Namibians are not communists:
they are oppressed instead by those
who brought the Word of God to Africa.
The oppressors also infiltrate black
schools by means of involvement in
sport, and cadets.

Recently, two makaku nyas from 101
and 202 Battalions respectively, spoke
of discrimination within the socalled
SWATF; said they were forced to fight
on the side of Unita in Angolan ter-
ritory; and resignations have started
because they are not ready to fight
their brothers who want to liberate the
country from the Botha regime. It isa
lesson for us to reject and condemn con-
scription and instead call for the
withdrawal of the SADF from Nami-
bian territory.

The recent invasion of the SADF in.
to Angola: the SADF isthe obstacle to
peace in southern Africa. They are
destabilising the Angolan economy,
and both the SADF and Reagan Ad-
ministration supply the Unita bandits
with Stinger missiles, sophisticated
armaments. The aggressor should stop
fighting for Unita and instead
withdraw its troops from Angolan soil
and go home.
A Resolution was adoptedinthe UN
callingontheSADF’s withdrawal from
Angola. The SA representative
responded that they would not
withdraw unless foreign troops were
withdrawn from Angola. This is unac-
ceptable and stubborn because the
MPLA Government has never
declared war against South Africa;
Fapla troops have never attacked or oc-
cupied SA territory; Angola is a
sovereign country which hastheright
to choose its own friends. |

IN THE WAKE of Christmas and my
dealings with The Namibian during
1987 I fee) myself competled to write
you this letter in my personal capaci-
ty in order toset the record straight on
the real meaning of the words peace
and goodwill.

After an in-depth study and research
on the reporting as presented by The
Namibian during the past year | come
to the conclusion that no objectivity
was portrayed by your newspaper con-
earning the South West Africa situa.
tion. Instead, you tried to portray the
enemy, Swapa including all tts wings
and associates as the “peace-seekers”
Nowhere could I find a call to stop ac.
tions by these organisations which are
detrimental to our country and all its
inhabitants, such as boycotts,
sabotage, etc. No, you rather opted to
go for the “alternative view’ of
revolution.

Let me give you only one example:
Justabout every week some kind of ac-
trocity by the security forces was
reported. The security forces spelt 1ot
out clearly that no atrocities by
members of the security forces
would be tolerated. Members who
are found guilty by a court of law will
be punished accordingly. However,
when Swapo claimed responsibility for
the bomb blast at the Gustav Voigts
Centre you reported it to be “a
demonstration of Namibian people's
resolve to shake off the yoke of col-
onialism by all necessary means”. Is
this promoting peace and goodwill?

Swapo opted for the revolutionary
methods some 21 years ago and let us
be honest, they've lost face, both
militanly and politically Although
you portray this organisation tobe the
“true liberatora” of this country, |
guarantee that freedom will be
something of the past IF they should
take over the reins. Howevar, that ia
hardly to be foreseen.

In you socalled “bumper edition’
dated December 18, 1987, to January
8, 1888, you predict another year of war
in your ’polstical perspective” column,
however, in the same breath you cal!
upon organisations and individuals
“to re-agsesa and come up with a con-
crete and effective plan of action to
break the chains in 1988 andreachthe
goal ofa free Namibia’ Thus, 1 accept
that you areatthesametime wishing
for peace and war. This isa contradic.
tion I'll never be able to understand

Please keep in mind: Swapo opted for
war. This is what they got. The securi-
ty forces were in being long before the
existence of Swapo and if you look at
the aim of any defence force in the
world, you will notice that their duty
{s, amongst other, the safeguarding of
life, property and freedom, During

1988 the security forces will maintain
this aim!

May | wish you not a worldly “hap:
py ‘festive season, but my prayers are
that you may also experience the love
of God towards mankind manifested
through the birth of His Son, our
Saviour and Lord, Jesus Christ, in
whom we trust to build the future of
this beautiful country with all its

NOTE: Don't talk absolute rubbish,
Commandant. You should know
better. An in-depth study and
research of the reporting in The
Namibian, and frequent, virtual
weekly reports of security force
atrocities (on your own admission)
should be telling you something.

You would prefer, obviously, that
because the Defence Force has
stated that “no atrocities by
members of the security forces will
be tolerated”, that we should not
report them at all. 1s this what you
define as ‘objectivity’? While on
thesubject, perhaps youcouldtell
ue how many members of the
‘secunty’ forces appeared incourt
for atrocities, and how much, in
claims of compensation, has been
paid out by the military tomembers
of the civilian population in the
past year? We wonder whether you
even keep euch statistics.

classify Swapo aa “the enemy”, and

target civiian members of the

ment. Have you forgotten that you
are apparently fighting against the
People's Liberation Army of
Namibia (PLAN), and not Swapo,
which is a legitimate and legal

The Namibtan neverclaimed the
bomb blast at the Gustav Voigts
Centre was a ‘demonstration of the
Namibian people's resolve to shake
off the yoke of colonialism by all

necessary means”. Your assertion
in this regard is entirely without
factual basis.

The'security’ forces inthis coun-
try have not maintained the aimof
“safeguarding of life, property and
freedom"" as you claim. Quite the
contrary, in fact.

And since you have the temerity
to talk about spreading the “love of
God”, perhaps you could explain to
us why a socalled ‘Chrietian’
defence force commits such ‘un-
Christian’ actions and why the ma-
jority of Christiansinthis country
call for the withdrawal of your

of your openly anti-SWA Territory

ask your commenton the incident on

been successful. hundreds of people

ed or seriously injured. It was only the
grace of God that saved South West
Africa of a disaster, initiated by a ter-
rorist who obviously has no feeling for
human life If, and we are sure they
will, Swapo claims responsibility for
this senseless deed, will it be portrayed

Tribute to Sean

THE DEATH of Sean MacBride
(January 16 1988) marks an endofthe
life of an outstanding and dedicated ad-
vocate for peace. He was a man of
tremendous skill and energy.

As the Irish Times (January 19)
coverage ofhis funeral acknowledged,
those who knew Sean MacBride will
testify to his dedication and tenacity
when itcame to fighting for causes he
believed in. I would like to pay tribute
here to the consistent support he gave
to the question of Namibia. )

In particular, as the United Nations
Commissioner for Namibia‘ 1973-77),
MacBride helped establish the UN In-
atitute for Namibia (UN IN), set up in
1976 in Lusaka, Zambia, and the

| : the United Nations
apa yd 1974 of the UN

Decree forthe Protection of Namibia's
Natural Resources. These were the two:
more distinctive projects ever under-
taken by the United Nations with
regard to Namibia.

UNIN has trained hundreds of
young Namibiana and conducted
research into educational, economic
and constitutional options for an in-
dependent Namibia.

The Decree was promulgated to try
to prevent the further extraction of
Namibia's fast dwindling natural
resources before independence. Mac-
Bride always saw thed asa prac-
tical piece of legislation, not just a
political statement. Last year the UN
took legal steps under the terms of the
Decree against the Dutch uranium
firm, Urenco, which enrichea uranium
from Namibia. MacBride continued to
actively support the Namibian cause
even when it was no longer his direct
responsibility. —

Although physically frail for sore |
yeara, MacBride had great astrengthof
conviction and dedication to his work
for human rights and justice, right to |

ALLOW me to express my heartfelt
disgust at Commandant G R C
Bester's childish, hopeless and self-
defeating comments which regularly
appear in this newspaper.

Asa patriotic and oppreesed Nami.
bian citizen, I really feel compelledto
respond to Commandant Bester’s
narrow-minded allegations against
the editor of this newspaper in par-
ticular and the entire oppressed but
fighting people of Namibia under the
leadership of Swapo.

I would like to make itcategorically
clear to Commandant Bester and his
masters in Pretoria that Swapo isthe
people of Namibia and the people are
Swapo. If South Africa is trying to
destroy Swapo, then they must be try-
ing to destroy the the suffering Nami-
bian people. But the apartheid regime
will not succeed in destroving the peo
ple’s movement. The apartheid govern
ment has been trying to bring Swapo
ta its knees for vears, but all therr ef-
forts were in vain

They have even tried to infiltrate the
organisation with spies, but none of
their dubious attempts have
succeeded.

Commandant Bester went on to ask
a foolsh and shortsighted question
“Who opted for revolution?” The
answer issimple and clear: Swapo. But
the next question to which he should
provide us witha proper answer is why
Swapo resorted to armed liberation
struggle.

Swapo Secretary General, Andimba
Toivo ya Toivo made the movement's
position clear in the Sixties: “Swapo
itself was a non-violent organisation.
but the South African government 13s
not truly interested in whether oppos!
tion is violent or non-violent. It does
not wish to hear any opposition to
apartheid”

Furthermore, Swapo President Sam
Nujoma. made clear the position of
Swapo with regard to the people's
revolution against colonial oppression
and exploitation at the WCC con.
ference in Lusaka last year. He said:

“On the question of violence, we make
no apology for the fact that afleracen-
tury of foreign oppression, genocidal
military campaigns and unbridled
economic exploitation, our movement
had decided totake up arms toconfront
colonial violence with armed self-
defence. It ig enshrined 1n our move-
mnent’s political programme that
Swapo does not glorify war We wish
that nobody hadever forced ustohave
to fight a war of national liberation

But the reality of prolonged colonial
oppression in Namibia being what it
is, we have been left wath no alter

nateve but to fight with armisin hand
for our liberty and right to self:
determination and independence To
those who would advise us not to fight
colonial oppression with armsin hand,
our answer is: ‘show us the available
non-violenl means to Namibia's rn

dependence and we shall fellow”

The available peaceful means to
Narnibian independence through UN
Resolution 435 has been deliberately
delayed by South Africa for ten years
Since 1981, the Swapo President has
expressed hia genuine willingness to
sign a ceasefire with the South African
regime any where in the world but in
Windhoek or Pretoria. But what was
the response of South Africa? They said
it was ‘premature’ to sign a ceasefire
with Swapo.

On socalled ‘atrocities’ allegedly
committed by Swapo against the
civilian population of this country, this
is wishful and baseless thinking on the
part of the people who have failed to

win the hearts and minds of the op-
pressed Namibians.

If Commandant Bester claims that
Swapo hag no support, then does he
think the over 3000 people whoattend
edthe recent Swapo public meeting in
Katutura were supporters of his
Government?

Commandant Bester cannot tell us
about the wavs and means as to how
Namibians should achieve freedom
and national independence, since the
whole history of the Afrikaners in
South Africa and Nannbia ig written
in blood How did they achieve their
self-determination from Britain?

Ithink itishigh trme Commandant
Bester stop writing rubbish to the peo-
ple’s newspaper and should rather
send his misleading and counter.
productive letters to the Koevoet
RKoerant

Lappeal to the editor not to publish
any more of his letters. He has access
toall necessary meansof propaganda
and should leave the-editor of this
newspaper and Dr A Shejavali of the
Council of Churches in peace.

t would like to close with the words
of va Toivo, whosaid that. “We believe
that South Afmea haga choice either
to live at peace with us or tosubdue us
by force. If you choose to crush us and
impose your willon us then you noton-
ly betray your trust, but you will live
in security for only so long as your
power is greater than ours. No South
Africa will live at peace in Namibia, for
each will know that hissecurity is bas-
ed on force, and that without force he
will face rejection by the people of
Namibia’.

at Okatana service Station, killing two
Americans and a local businessman,

Swapo has never committed any such

against Namibians, and I call upon the
international community to quickly
intervene. We, the people of Namibia

even if you rape, imprison, maim, kill

AS LONG as I live, I remain flab-
bergasted by the gravity of audacity,
courage and perseverance some people
are endowed with. These are the words
which slip into my mind whenever |
stop to muse over the kind of personaili-
ty of our Bishop Kleopas Dumeni of
ELCIN.

To me the Bishop orchestrates a
typical leader, who, given a chance
wasted by fortune-seekers and
hypocritical politicians in thiscountry,
will or can lead Namibia into blossom-
ing tomorrows.

The Bishop's charisma goes beyond
spiritual confines. It isto me always a
blessing to listen to his sermons and
how I wish, always, he could be allot-
ted the Presidency.

The Bishop displayed metaphysical
courage and boldness at the recent
mass funeral of victimsof the Oshakati
bank bomb massacre. In the face of a
gruesome and satanic horror which
struck numb the people of the north,
where innocent young lives, including
that of his own daughter, were put to
waste, he said his say and he said it
right and in a calm and unshaken
voice.

One really wonders atthe charisma
this man of God haa, for, even if death
struck his family a cataclyamic blow,
almost thrice in a row, he goes forth to
console his parishioners, when he
should himeelf sit and be consoled.

I was offended by the hypocritical
condolence from Louis Pienaar andde
Wet of Sector 10, who ironically pledg-
ed a police investigation and the ap-
prehension of culprits, forgetting that
they, including a confused Kozonguizi,
have already branded Swapo
responsible.

Why didn't the master of ceremony
at ‘Kandaha’ Dumeni’s funeral repeat
such soothing condolences from Sam
NujomaofSwaporather than wasting
time to read messages from those
nonentities? IfPienaar andde Wet can
heed Bishop Dumeni’s cal] on
February 27 and withdraw their South
African forces from Namibia and im-
plement UNSCR 435 this year, they
will be saved the energy of sending us
their unwanted condolences
emanating from deaths of such a
nature as on February 19.

I strongly believe in the message
from the Roman Catholic Church that
the Oshakati bomb massacre was a
devilish, rather than a divine will. If
that act was a Godly-premeditated
phenomenon, then God has betrayed
his own commandment ‘Thou shalt
not kill’, and has been incahoots with
enemies to kill innocent souls in the
ban.

Although it is hard to understand,
probably one should follow Bishop
Dumeni’s words of encouragement not
to despair but to trust that the
Almighty will one day crush the teeth
of the enemy and rid Namibia of hor- |
rendous deaths in bomb blasts.

May the Bishop and other bereaved
families be consoled. To the people of
Namibia, unity is strength against the |
bloodstained hands of Pretoria.
Namibia will one day explode with
laughter and peace and not with bomb
blasts.

IS IT possible to talk about church and
politics at the same time? Do the two
have anything in common? Can the
church mix with politica? Such ques-
tions and more similar questions are
struggled with in the context of
Namibia in particular. Such questions
are both theological and political. For-
tunately, theological and political
questions are asked by human beings
who are involved either in the church
and/or politics in one way or another.

My aim here is to open up a
theolagical and political debate for
concerned people in a situation of apar-
theid, colonialism, racism, exploita-
tion and draconian lawssuch as those
of Namibia. I am stating only
preliminary remarks, sparing the rest
for contemplated responses.

The truth of the matter is that the
Church cannot claim its existence
without people Likewise politics can.
not be without people. It is the people
whoconstitute the church. it is the peo-
ple who politicise. The basic concern of
the church is wider and broader than
ity numerical membership. It is within
the framework of the Church's pro-
pheticcall and public responsibility to
aspire for peace, justice, freedom,
respect of human rights and dignity to
all people irrespective of their stations
in life. On the other hand, the Church
is not serving angels, but human be-
ings whose basic needs - among others
- include food, shelter, clothing and
security or safety. In essence, these |

needs cannot be secured without some
forms of political sind economic exer-

- cise. In fact, even if the Church may
manage tochristianise each and every

person on the globe (if that could be
possible) political structures and

| economic systems will be imperative.

Unfortunately we often hear the par-
rotcry that “thechurch should not be
involved or mixed with politics”, as if
there isadivinecommand, especially
given tocertain people, tobe political-
ly involved. |

The irony of the issue is that most of
those whocry loudly that “the church
should or even must not mix with
politics’ are themselves members of
the Church - of whom some may well
still gotochurch on Sundays. The ques-
tion is: where do they hide their
mysterious political bodies and souls
when they go tochurch clothed in their
church body-souls?

It should be known by both believers
and non-believers that the church pro-
claims the God who created the
universe including mother earth. Does
politics take place outside and beyond
this universe? If that is the case, then
the Church would be wrong to be con-
cerned with political oppression and
injustices taking place outside God’s
created cosmos. As far as we know,
politics is done not only on earth but
exercised by these God-created
creatures - human beings. Ontheother
hand, the language of the church
transcends this life to heaven as well.

If politics is touching the lives of
church members in Namibia, how can
it be, that the Church of God of justice
and love can be indifferent to suffering
and the selfish spirit of imperialism?
Ifthe Church’s mission before all else
is supernatural - preaching only
reward in heaven whenone diesand let
misery sndoppression inthis life pass
unabated - then no wonder some temp-
ted tocall it the “opium of the people”.
There is no way forthe Church toavoid
auch accusations until the Church
takes up its role of a conscience of 4.con-
scienceless society, Neither the church
nor any one responsible person ts ex-
emptad from the obligation to resist
cruelty, violence, colonialism, ex:
ploitation of person by another person,
and the like The Church, Logether or
in conjunction with all concerned peo- |
ple (wherever they are) should join
hands to ceaselesaly struggle 90 that
human dignity and peace be reatored

onearth = =
In short, politics is not. foreign to
On Carti. .

In short, politics is not foreign to
members of the Church. To be a
member of the Church does not extract
any one person from being a human be-
ing with human needs. Therefore, the
Church as comprised of people cannot
be accused of mixing with politics un-
til a normal political atmosphere is
restored - when threat to human lives
and properties ceases and safety and
security, is guaranteed by a proper
judicial system and humane, accep-
table protection of human rights.

Again, these are just opening
remarks. | am expecting a response.
Especially from those who feel this is
a scandal both to their Christian or
otherwise understanding of the
Church and political analysis.
Remember also that we do not speak
about a theocratic state here since this

is not our vision in an independent
Namibia. I have deliberately scratch-
ed the surface. Let us ponder together
over this issue of church and politica in
our abnorma!] Namibian society today.

tempt to cause hatred among the peo-
ple. South Africa is always trying to
divide us in order to facilitate their il-
legal rule over Namibia.

I feel this action was intended to
smear the name of Swapo and at the
same time to frighten and silence Mr
Kalangula who calls for the
withdrawal of the South African
Defence Force and the implementation
of Resolution 435, and to coerce him in-
to accepting the interim government
which was imposed on the people
against their wishes.

WE note the letter from Professor A
Heywood, published in your
newspaper on May 20, 1988, in which
she differs with certain statements
made in an advertisement which was
placed by NPP 435 in the Windhoek
Observer. We would like to respond to
the three major points which she has
raised in her letter:
1) On the question of whether or not
Resolution 435 provides for elections
under joint South African and United
Nations (UN) supervision: Prof
Heywood is quite correct in stating
that ‘‘Resolution 435 and the
documents surrounding it are reflec-
tions of historical reality”. Your cor-
respondent correctly points out that
Resolution 385 (which preceded
Resolution 435 by tlwo-and-a-half
years) declares that free elections be
held under supervision and control of
the UN. However, in order to give effect
to Resolution 385, the Western Five
negotiated a settlement plan for
Namibia with South Africa and
Swapo, which culminated in the
Western Proposal for Settlement
(Security Council Document 5/126386).

This Western proposal was
thereafter ratified by the United Na-
tions Security Council (UNSC) in its
Resolution 435 (1978) and as such
forms part of the resolution.

In Resolution 431 of July 27, 1978,
the Security Council took note of the
Western Proposals, and requested the
Secretary-General to submit a report
containing his recommendations tor
the implementation of the Western
Proposals. Thus the Western Proposals
were accepted by the UNSC in Resolu-
tion 431. In Security Council Docu-
ment S/12827 of August 29, 1978, the
Secretary-General made recommen-

_ dations, as requested in Res 431; later,
in an Explanatory Statement
(8/12869) of September 28, 1978, he ad-
dressed and explained certain con-
cerns raised during consultations with
all the parties involyed. Both of these
documents were approved in Res 435
of September 29, 1978, and the
Western Proposals were approved and
ratified as such by Res 435 (1978).

It is clear from the Western Pro-
posals, although not explicitly stated,
that in effect the elections will be held
ratified as such by Res 435 (1978).

It is clear from the Western Pro-
posals, although not explicitly stated,
that in effect the elections will be held
under the joint supervision and contro!
of South Africa and the UN: paragraph
4 states, “In carrying out his respon-
sibilities, the Special Representative
will work together with the offical ap-
pointed by South Africa (the
Administrator-General) to ensure the
orderly transition to independence.

Paragraph 5 states: *... the United
Nations Special RepreBentative will
have to satisfy himself ai each stage as
tothe fairness and appropriateness of
al] measures affecting the political pro-
cess...’ and‘... may himself make pro-
posals in regard to any aspect of the
political process. ’

Furthermore, paragraph 6 states:
‘‘Theimplementation ofthe electoral
process, including the proper registra-
tion of voters and the proper and timely
tabulation and publication of voting
results, will also have to be conducted
to the satisfaction of the Special
Representative.’

In other words, the Special Represen-
tative does not directly conduct the
electoral process but has joint control,
through his proposed recommenda.
tions and supervisory role. This fact is
attested to by the Assistant Secretary.
General's Information Circular, dated

July 16, 1982, which confirms the ar-
rangements forthe implementation of
Resolution 435 (1978). In paragraph 2,
under the heading ‘Informal Sum.
mary ,itisstatedthat: ‘Theelections
will be undertaken by the South
African Administrator-General and
his administration. Both the
Adminiatrator-Genera| and the
Special Representative of the
Secretary-General will remaininthe
country until independence.”

2) On the question of whether the
Administrator-General appointed by
the South African Government will
administer the country: Prof Heywood
is quite correct in stating that Res 435
provides for ‘‘the withdrawal of South
Africa’s illegal administration from
Namibia and the transfer of power to
the people of Namibia, with the
assistance of the UN in accordance
with Res 385 (1976)"" However, it
should be pointed out that Res 435
(1978) is a compromise plan designed
to remove South Africa’s illegal oc-
cupation in Namibia, with the co.
operation of the South African
representative, the Administrator.
General, as acentral feature tothe im-
plementation of theSettlement Plan.

: 7 ee [ee . ee
It is clear from the documentation
which is attendant upon Res 435 and
its accompanying resolutions, thatthe
Administrator-General and his
department wil] administer Namibia
during the transitional period, but
under conditions in which he will have
to repeal before the elections ‘‘all re-
maining discriminatory or restrictive
laws, regulations and administrative
measures’, which may inhibit the
holding of free and fair elections
(paragraph 7A of Western Proposals).
The arrangements for the release of all
political prisoners will also be the
responsibility of the Administrator.
General (paragraph 7B of Western Pro-
posals). These and al] other necessary
procedures to attain the object of free
and fair elections, will be overseen by,
ratified by, the UN Special Represen-
tative with the assistance of the
civilian component of UNTAG.

On the question of whether the
South African Police/SWA Police will
maintain law and order during the
transitional period: It should be noted
that the United Nations Transitional
Assistance GroupiUNTAG) is not in-
tended to be a police force. Thisisclear
if reference ts made to paragraph 9 of
the Western Proposais which state.
“Primary responsibility for mamtain-
ing law and order in Namibia shall rest
with the existing police forces.” This
Proposal was accepted by the
Secretary-General in his Explanatory
Statement which outlined the Special
Representative’s explicit respon.
sibilities to oversee the existing police
forces. Inthisregard, animportant role
of the Special Representative, assisted
by the civilian component of UNTAG,
will be to take measures against in-
timidation or interference with the |
electoral process, to accompany the ex-
isting police force and to ensure the
good conduct of these forces(paragraph
29 of the Secretary-General’s report
Document $/12827 and the Ex-
planatory Statement S/12869).
Earlier, the Western Proposal had
stated that the exiating police force
would be limited to “the carrying of
small armsin the norma! performance
of their duties” - acondition to be over-
seen by the UNTAG civilian/police
component (paragraph 9, Western
Proposals).

IFIRSTLY, warm greetings tothe staff
lof The Namibian. Please allow me to
voice my opinion in the people's
popular newspaper ‘The Namibian.
lam very worried about the colonial
behaviour of some of the so-called
tribal chiefs in Owambo known as
Gabriel Kautwima and Mr Gottlieb
Dan. These two men are some of the
leaders of the colonial organisation
known as “Etango”’ in Owambo. They
are still refusing the removal of the
racist military-base at Ponhofi Secon-
dary School which caused the the loss
of many lives in the surrounding areas.
especially of the Ponhofi-students.
They are new encouraged by the
Administrator-General, Louis
Pienaar, who has recently announced
that the military base at Ponhofi will
not be removed.

Please you two chiefs, are you 80
blinded by P W Botha that youcan't see
how your nation is suffering under the
Botha-regime who is using you as his
protectors? Do you know who Mr Louis
Pienaar is? Do you know who he
represents here? He is not and wil
never represent the Namibian people!
He is there for the benefit of the racist
South Africa, to protect and promote
the crucial laws and policies of South
Africa.

Louis Pienaar has nothing todo with
the demands of the majority of the
Namibian people.

You, Kautwima and Dan have recent-
ly said that your lives are worth more
than those hundreds of young suffer-
ing Namibian students. This only
shows that you lack patriotic feelings
and instead represent the racist-
Botha-government.

Itseems as if you are not far from tak-
ing an oath of allegiance in the South
African Government, like Mr. Moses
Katjiongua have done, whois ignoring
his own people and instead protecting
South Africa’s racist policies and laws.

The Namibian people are demanding
peace, justice, self-detemination and
independence brought by the im-
plementation of Resolution 435. lam
challenging you to personally attend
a Swapo-rally one day, to see how the
majority of the Namibian people ex-
press their willingness for the in-
dependence brought about by Swapo
and Resolution 435.

This is an open letter to the so-

Andrew Matjila and I refer to his
shameful speech on the Radio —
Qwambo in the Okambiya
Kamahola programme.

He was speaking about boycotts in
the north as well asin Katutura, Win-
dhoek. What upsets me is when Mr
Matjila said that the students have
nothiny todo with the implementation
of the future plan, Resolution 435.

This arose from the time students
wrote placards demanding the im-
mediate implementation of the peace
plan.

How can he say we students are too
young todemand the implementation
of the plan?

I personally say to him that we
students are not children and foolish.
He has allowed himself to be used by
South Africa.

I warn Mr Matjila to tell his
Makakunyas to end the tear gas and
rubber bullets as the way of suppress-
ing the strikes. We studenta are the
leaders of tomorrow and we are not
mistaken to demand the implemen-

STUDENTS in the faculty of science
at the Academy, and the whole institu-
tion, especially the progressive
students as well as the Namibia com-
munity at large, were shocked to learn
of the sudden death of comrade Erwin
Thuhua, a first-born son of Dr Thomas
and Mrs Jacobina Ihuhua.

First | would like to express my
deepest sympathy with the Ihuhua
family and my words of condolence go
toall relatives and friends whoare left
behind. May we find peace andcomfort
in knowing that our beloved one, the
late Erwin [huhua, is in God's care.

To all peace-loving Namibians, at
home and inexile, his death isa great
loss. He proved himself to be commit-
ted tothe cause of total independence
of our beloved Namibia. Asa student
he devoted most of his time to his
studies. At the university and in the
community at large, heattended most
progressive meetings which were held
inthe past. He alsoshowed himselfto
be able to assume responsibility and
was serious about the struggle for
liberation.

Whenever he suggested or con-
tributed an idea, he had thought it out
critically before airing it. Whenever he —
spoke, he spoke sense. In his last letter
to The Namibian in May this year, in
which he congratulated Cde Vihajo, he
showed his true colours to the public.

We salute Cde Ihuhua for his con-
tribution to the struggle for in-
dependence. May he rest in peace.

I definitely do not believe in any SA pro-
tection because this is not the case. Pro-
tection means to be secure or to live in
peace - and this is not the case
throughout Namibia.

What the government is doing these
davs, particularly in the far north is
threatening and deplorable, and in
stead of being protected, innocent peo
ple are often killed, in many cases
without reason.

I have a spicific event in mind: the
murder of the old Mr Erkki Shishit-
womunku, who was killed on 27 May
this year. allegedly by Koevoet
members pretending to be Swapo
fighters. But fortunately they were
caught red-handed by his son.

The question is, whois now represen.
ting the people? Isat the SADF ar is
Natublaananarchist country? Uitis
SADE why are they killing instead of
protecting?

We. us people who five near the
borders, have nothing ta do with the
SADF but have dong been subject to

them. Since 1975 the border towns
have become sad places and places of
mourning for people killed by the
socalled defence force. We do not want
protection any more from the South

_ Africa army. We have now been ‘ pro-

tected’ for long enough! (13 years is

AN open letter to Nanso diasiderits:
I (Katjiua, Rukoro, Makari, Zauana,

Karamata, Tjimune and Siririka):

I would like to reply to your long letter
which appeared in The Namibian of
July 15 in which you shamelessly
revealed your anti-Swapo sentiments
(or fears of Swapo).

lam responding to your letter in my
capacity asaSwapo member andl am
in no way stating Swapo's policy on
political rivals, however, I believe that
the overwhelming majority of Swapo
supporters would agree with me.

No doubt you belong to the ethnic
party which is trying to unfairly be
called an equal of Swapo inthe libera-
tion struggle. I myself, initially, and
until very recently, wrongly believed
that Swapo should join hands with
what is referred to (sometimes wrong:
ly) progressive groupings against the
common enemy.

But after your letter and your party
Secretary General’s (properly termed)
‘thinly-veiled attack on Swapo at
Okahandja, I have changed my mind
and suggest that this idea be
relinquished.

You mentioned in your letter that
students who are not Swapo members

ideological direction N anso ann

and serve the interests of the rival
groups which failed to get political sup-
port in the national political market.

If vou want competition with Swapo,
the movement is not worried by that,
and will not participate in the competi-
tion because it is too busy with the
struggle for independence at this
critical stage. You have plenty of time
todothat, I guess. However your com-
petition will only be meaningful ifyou
join hands with South Africa and its
allies, but Swapo is determined to fight
South Africa and its allies at all costs.
You give the impression that you agree
with Mr P W Botha whosaid he would
not tolerate a Swapo government in
Windhoek. But I must remind you that
a Swapo government is inevitable
despite this remark by the South
African State President, because he is
in no position to prevent this and
neither are you. Would you opt for ban-
ditry (Unita style)? I would leave this
patriotic question to you and your
conscience.

In conclusion | would like to refer you
to what Mr Emil. Appolus had to say
when interviewed by Rajah Muna-
mava, and.I quote: ‘‘I am no great ad-
mirer of Swapo but it is a fact that on-
~ ly Swapo and South Africa can bring
about peace by signing a ceasefire.
Facts are facts’.

What a wise man at last!

Costs of 435

WHAT many Namibians have warned
against for many years has now come
to pass. As soon as the South African
Government tells us of ‘agreement’
with regard toimplementation of 435,
we are informed that it will cost
billionsandthe UN must now look for
the money.

For years, all UN resolutions aimed
at preserving the natural wealth of our
country, have been ignored by South
Africa and all those nations exploiting
our natural resources. South African
occupation of Namibia costs millions
aday but no money is available for the
implementation of the peace plan.
Salaries of South Africa’s proxies in
Namibia have been increased time and
again and for that, money was

available. And in all this, Namibians
had no say, they only paid taxes.

While we are not overexcited at thie
point that the agenda for implementa-
tion will follow the time schedule that
was indicated by the SA Foreign
Minuater, the time has come for Nam.
bians to state their position with
regard to who will foot the bill Surely
we cannot accept that our country has
become a poor and underdeveloped and
dependent country all of a sudden
Therefore we would like to make some
suggestions to the UN Secretary
General who will now be presented
with the bill

Asa people whohave remained self.
reliant through the ages, we would not
hke to become international beygars
at this point and would lhke to con
tribute towards the costs of implemen

A few suggestions for Namibians to
ponder

Namibia still has some resources
therefore we propose that an indepen.
dent commission be established im
mediately with complete insight into
all transactions involving monies leav-
ing this country, with immediate
effect,
_ that all export of Namibian natural
resources be monitored by the UN and
all resources accruing therefore, be put
in a fund towards paying for
implementation;
= that with immediate effect, all
monies collected through sales tax be
paid into the abovementioned fund;
C that the exhorbitant salaries paid
to SA proxies in Namibia be im-
mediately stopped and that money be

pat in the abovementioned
all know that the AG andthe BA
civil service runs Namibla and they
should receive salaries from the ool-
onial] power according to international
Practice;
O thatal) these companies which, ac-
cording to the Thirion Report, have
been sending out natural resources il-
legally, or have paid leas taxes than
they should have, be compelled to pay
the said amounts in the implementa.
tion fund;
J that all taxes paid by Namibiansin
order to fund second tier authorities,
be channelled into the said fund.

Since the people of this country have
never hed a say in whathappenstothe
funds collected through the means
above, they should do eo now. The six
points mentioned above are only
pointers. We realise there should be
some control and therefore suggest
that all those parties which have been
in favour of the implementation of 435
now form a watchdog committee and
take this issue up immediately. All
Namibians know that thesaid parties
are constituent members of the /Ai-
/Gams group

Namibiang, the time has come for
you to take up this challenge.

accepted standards of decency; fire or

of these needs by a certain greedy

love us but they just fell deeply in love
with the land Namibia because she 1s
very rich. Now they are raping our
motherland. America, Britain, West
Germany and many other European
countries are more interested in
mineral resources our land produces
and not inthe Namibian people.

The South African soldiers and police
killed many Namibians because of the
land not because Namibianscommit-

of this fact that they must struggle, not
for a sce of bread or a loafofbread, but
for the whole bakehouse. We muat free

ALLOW me tocomment on the letter
which appeared in The Namibian of
August 05, under the heading
“Pallacious’ written by V T Kavari.

I've been present al the Nanso con:
yrcsses since 1986¢ second congress) up
to this year with the fourth congress.
where I've experienced a spirit of
brotherhood.

What I have observed is that after &
speaker has delivered a speech, oppor:
tunity was given to the house for
discussion, questions, correction, ad.
dition, clarification, comment, etc.

I believe this was done so that with
the departure of the congress no com:
rades could go to their respective
places with unsolved problems as it ap
pears to be in your case.

I'm just wondering whether you
never got the opportunity to air your
viewsand to gopersonally tothe NEC
Members, instead of doing it in the
newspapers and to create a tasteless
spirit among the students, which 1s
totally unnecessaFy.

If you were at the congress you will
remember that comrade Shihwamen!
was the last person to clarify on this
issue. |

He explained that people have to
make the difference between 4 pro
gressive parly and a liberation move-
ment. He went on saying that pro-
gressive parties are mostly concerned
with ethnic issues, while Swapo which
‘sa liberation movement, is aimed at
liberating all the peace loving people
in Namibia irrespective of their col-
ours, ethnic groups, etc.

This is a fact that we, in Namibia
have to accept that Swapo is the only,
only armed movement that isfighting
(uniess, a8 Shinwameni said, “there is
another armed movement that 1s
hiding underground’)

Whatcomrade Steve saidat the con-
gress on this issue was positive and I,
with the majority accepted it, although
you differed as you said, in your letter.
Of course, minorities always differ!
That we have learned from history in
this country.

Lastly, let the truth not hurt ua,
please!

The honourable Administrator
General is adding to the confusion by
repeating issues that were long since
dealt with. Are his pronouncements
aimed at shipwrecking the present
negotiations, or are they an indication
of South Africa’s unwilling participa-
tion in the talks?

The question of the socalled ‘UN par:
tiality’ was addressed to the satisfac.
tion of the SA Government from 1978
to 1982. South Africa wae satisfied to
such an extent that at one point the SA
Minister of Foreign Affairs went on
record saying the “Cuban issue’ was
the only obstacle to the implementa.
tion of Resolution 435.

It is however, important to state that
itis not only the UN that must be im.
partial, The same impartiality 18 ex:
pected from the office of the Ad.
ministrator General. Both the Special
Representative ofthe UN's Secretary
General and the SA representative -1n
terms of 436 - are meant toobserve im.
partiality during the implementation
of 435.

| It is thus quertionabie:

“! for a South African Government

representative to tell Namibians who

unite. IsittosafeguardSouth African
interests? Would anybody whoclaims
to be a true Namibian really want to
be directed by a South African Govern:

not lay claim to impartiality.

RE is another sfde tothe story of J
the socalled “Ten years of peace in East
Caprivi’ (The Windhoek Advertiser,
August 26). It has not had ten years of
peace as Brigadier Gert Nel suggests:
it HAS been ten years of humiliation
and intimidation.

Iregard this report as an attempt to
invalidate the very successful Swapo
rally held in the region on August 20,

as wellastodiscredit Capriviansin the
eyes of fellow Namibians. Brigadier
Nel’s tong report on the socalled ‘peace’
is mere propaganda.

Leaders have been intimidated and
harassed by the SADF and its counter-
part, Swapol, formerly SAP. The socall-
ed ‘leaders’, as claimed by Brigadier
Nel, are instruments used to further
the prevailing status quo. The tradi-
tional leaders are merely the
equivalents of the Katjiuonguas and
Matyplas of Namibia.

As regards what Brigadier Nel calls
‘cooperation’ between the army and
civilians, I have the following to say:

* intense psychological war is at work
in the region; 7

* the people do not admire the SADF
or SWATF, because it is not their army,
but South Africa's, The civilians may
‘cooperate with the army because they
need to survive; but itis not out of their
own will. Their fear is legitimate.

The bitter irony behind the creation
of 701 Battalion is that most young
men have joined the army as a last
resort. The rate of unemployment in
Caprivi is so high that people are left [
with two major options: to join the ar-
my, undesirable as that is, or become
a teacher. |

The SADF and Swapol have repress-
ed any sign of protest so that may give
an illusion of ‘peace’ in the region.

Regarding Enok/FNDC, this com-
pany may be credited with
monopolistic and exploitative prac-
tices in the region. It is notorious for
paying low wages, and they are cer-
tainly not contributing to any develop-
ment worth mentioning

The SWABC is nothing other thana
mouthpiece of the interim government
and ita masters in Pretoria: It is also
used to disseminate the kind of pro-
paganda which Brigadier Nel

[Tis high time that Ptry te put the
records straight and clear up some
nusunderstanding. Since the schoo!
crisis started in June, our school has
been the focal pomnt of boycotters and
Ht wasinthe lime hght of newspapers.

Strangely enough, nonews editor at-
tempted tointerview me for first hand
information [ must admit that
whenever vou are under constant
pressure from both sides, you tend to
blunder

The Namibian must not fall into a
trap of distorted reporting, because it
ig internationally credited for its objec.
tive reporting.

It was reported in The Namibian
how the principal of Secondary School
Katuturacalled inthe police toarrest
the pupils. [t was further reported that
the pupils were disappointed by their
principal's actions.

In the first place, the principal did
1 is how it is done at all schools under
these situations. ‘According to your
report, pupils were disappointed at my
actions. Those were not my actions.
But I was very much disappointed at
the behaviour of my pupils, because
they did not ask the “foreign” pupils
not to use abusive language towards
me.

I did not and do not deserve that
treatment frompupils,andthehonest |
pupils of my school can testify this. =
wanted to address thecrowd but seem.
ingly the only response pupils know ig
“Down, down and once again down”,
clapping handsand dance-running. To
my shock and surprise, “foreign”
pupils took the fire brigade hoapipers
chased me away with water and stones.
Even my pupils who participated in
these actions did not even try to stop
the others from doing it.

The police are on patrol all over
Katutura and more especially around
our school because you made it a soft
target in order to either discredit me
or to put members of my staff under
scrutiny, and they can see for
themselves what is going on at the
school. Why don't you give all schools
as tough a time as you do with us: why
do you concentrate on two or three
schools only? Do you have some
motives or are you bribed to discredit
some schools?

As president of NAMTA (Namibia -
Teachers Association), I want to
reiterate my organization's point viz.
that we do have understanding with

- most demands, but we can't condone
endless boycotts. We admire those who
continue with it but salute the others
who want to continue their studies.

Tocometothese ‘foreign’ pupilson
our soil - it is unfair that they leave

. their schools in peace and come now
and again toharass us. Those who say
] gave away thechildren have toreason
realistically because] readthenames —
of my school pupils, and those who re-

_ mained were not of my school. And how
can these “foreign” pupils expect me
to “protect’’ them when they gave me _
such rough treatment by shouting me. |
“down”, by wetting me, throwing —
stones, and inaulting me for things 1 |
did not deserve or commit.

“The student movement still temains

united as before. Whathappened at the
congress was mere recognition and
acknowledgement of the reality that
Swapo is the leader of the liberation
movement, let alone being the only
liberation movement. Kavari, in fact
should show cause why Nanso must
not acknowledge Swapo leadership of
the national liberation struggle. I feel
strongly thattoaccept the unavoidable
reality that Swapo leads the nation
liberation struggle does not make us
politically affiliated to Swapo.

What is surprising for Kavari's let-
ter and all others who seem to be con-
cerned with Nanso’s socalled pro-
Swapo stand, isthat noneofthem men-
tioned the current crisis in education.
An impression is given that Nanso’s
recognition that Swapo leads the
liberation struggle is more evil and
criminal than the current crisis in
education. Meetings after meetings
are called and proposed not to address
the crisis, but Nanso. Nanso now has
become the crisis. Kavari talks of
another national student movement
as a possibility, simply because Nan-
so has recognized Swapo leadership of
our struggle. IfNanso had recognized
or named the HNP as a progressive
party, than one would understand and
conceptualize the cry of Kavari et al.
If Nanso had failed to address the cur-
rent crisis properly and Kavari et al
talk of another student movement
which shall address the crisis in a bet-
ter way, one would understand their
cry. But thecry issimply because Nan-
so says Swapo leads our nation at war
with SA colonizers. Swapo, the pro-
greasive movement, the organizer of
victories of our people in their heroic
anti-colonial and anti-imperialist
struggle, has suddenly become the
crisis now in which energies must be
expended. The colonizera are now
given’ peace and their deliberately
created crisis ia not ad eased, Then.

ing against the regime.
According tothe current talks
South Africa and America introdaced
new issues in the matter and are try-
ing their best to switch the burden of
talks to the opposite parties - will
Angola accept all the SA. and
American demands? If yes, what will
happen to Angola next?
We rejected the connection of Cubans
to the independence of Namibia and

wore and are still demanding the

withdrawal of the S.A. troops and ita il-
legal regime from Namibia, but not
one of either parties (South Africa or
America) is willing to listen to us as
they are in favour of war. South Africa
staysin Walvis Bay even after UNSCR
435 is implemented - what then?

We are intimidated by the SA.
regime with its apartheid laws and
military atrocities. It is preaching its
“goodness” to win the hearts and
minds of the people, but we suffered for
a long time under its colonial regime.
It is still continuing to minimize our
political rights - how will we continue
with talks?

Cubans were willing to help Angola
from the intimidation we expenencing
here and their presence in Angola is
legal. As long as the intimidation to
the Namibian people continues
Angola cannot be saved.

Those who are threatened by the
presence of Cubans in Angola are the
“Terreblanche group’ of the South
African regime, who want to exploit
the Angolan people and its allies. Once
the Cubans withdraw from Angola the
‘“Terreblanche speech” in the past few
days will be manifested practically.

The Namibian people welcome the
Cubans, because they are comrades -
they don't kill, but save. We have ex-
perienced SA (not Cuban) atrocities;
and the Angolans too.

No to homelands

THE tnbalists who are trying to
divide this country into homelands
must be made to remember that our
nation cannot tolerate such divisions
in Namibia. The land is one, and the

e are one. Our nation must stand
firm in unity to fight against all forms
of divisions and homclands in the

country. Things like the socalled
Republic of Rehoboth and Caprivi
cannot be tolerated in the would-be
independent Namibia.

_ Those who are involved in organi-
sing such things must repentand give
up such reactionary ideas immedi-
ately. This country is one, from the
Angolan border to the Orange River,
and from the Zambian border to the
Aduantic Ocean.

We find it disturbing that we still
have brainwashed Afncan (Namib-
ian) intellectuals who believe in
homelands and tibalism when we
have our heroes who have died for
the freedom of Namibia as a whole.
] just wonder from which books these
people have gathered such mislcad-
ing information.

These people should know that itis
utterly irresponsible and a marked
betrayal of those who died fighting
for the independence of Namibia as
well as the masses in this county.
Those people should also know that
their actions are a sign of mental
subjugation, and what J would call
the disease, requires an antidote.
Luckily, unlike Aids, an anudote is
available. People involved in declar-
ing homelands in Namibia must take
the undistorted history books and
read. perhaps this will make they
realise that they owe apologies to
faithful Namibians.

I appeal to our brothers and sisters
in Rehoboth and C aprivi not to sup-
port the people trying to lead them
into total nco-colonialism. All Na-
mibians must have the freedom to
live where they want to; and not be
confined to certain regions.

Swapo has been fighting to rid use
of the colonial yoke of South Africa
and the movement accepts all patri-
otic Namibians who want to be free.
Swapo condemns tnbalism, region-
alism, sexism, racism and above all,
colonialism. The people of Namibia
should be vigilant because the pup-
pets trying lo umpose homelands upon
them are creating civil war condi-
tions so that there is no peace ina free

The reality is this: rape is a

by the Supreme Count. In 1986
160 cases were reported, of which
94 were brought to wial, In 1987
the figures were 201 reported and
114 tried, in 1988 266 and 67

Delaying tactic

ALLOW me a space in the

powers, mainly the United States.

First of all they linked the
Namibian peace process to the
withdrawal of Cuban woops from
Angola; now they want to link the
number of Untag troops and offi-
cials with the negotiations. The

state that the Americans are the
ones who have the money; they
are the ones who have to pay for
the implementation of Resolu-
tion 435.

Now the US have another cx-
cuse: they say that they can only
afford R100 million or the equiva-
lent in Dollars. This means that
the Untag component has to be
reduced. If they have to pay the
full amount (for Untag) then they
will demand that the Angolan
Governmem negotiate with Units.

war. They are the ones continu-

They are the ones who declared
the ANC a terrorist movement;
they are the ones which attacked
the MiG 23’s of Libya; they are
the ones who don’t want the Pal-
estinians to negotiate with the
Israclis.

If they want to reduce the number
of Untag troops, then they must

change Resolution 435, because: —

Resolution 435 says that 7500
Untag troops will arrive in’ Na-
mibia to supervise the elections;
Resolution 435 does not stipulate
that the Angolan Government must
negotiate with Unita; and in Reso-
lution 435 there is no such thing
that Untag troops must be com-
bined with the Koevoet or the
police.

If they wantto contradict Reso-

mulate it.

‘A sensitive nerve

Indeed Mr Shipanga's ‘New Year's
Message’ touched a sensitive nerve
in me, especially with the untruths
and political dishonesty that ‘mes-
sage’ displayed.

In his article (27/01/89) Mr Shipanga
implies that because Father Wolfe
had said that ‘‘reconciliation of the
Namibian people as a whole is needed
before we can become one Namibia
one Nation’’, then anybody who uses
the word ‘reconciliation’ on televi-
sion must go unchecked. Mr Shipanga,
reconciliation is not merely an event
- it is a process in which not only
what we say, but also what we do,
will determine the essence of our
determination.
~ So do not think that people will
believe your sincenty because you
use the words ‘peace’ and ‘reconcili-
ation’, even more so when your frame
of reference is artificial: (that your
TGNU protected the rights of Na-
mibians during the past. three-and-a-
half years).

| maintain, Mr Shipanga, that your
Cabinet sided with the South Afncan
‘government in trying to stop duc
legal process, and I add that all this
was done at the expense of the tax-
payers, Please say this is not true, and
tell the Namibian people what posi-
tion did you take, and what you as
Cabinet did in the interest of due
legal process in the iste Wapota and
| *Shifidi cases.

Taleo maintain that national cam-
paigns and international diplomatic
- gnd economic pressure forced the |
ence.

a) National campaigns:

- When the churches marched on
_ the side of the poor (Corpus Chnst)
gangs from some government circles
could not stop them. When Kameeta
gave that emouonal address at St
Andrews in Khomasdal, the people
were moved to action, and more
Koevoet was armed and deployed on
the strects of Katutura

- When Swapo held a public rally
after five years of silence, fifteen
thousand people came. Apartheid
shivered in Namibia and police and
army tactics were adjusted as evident
in the circumstances surrounding the
death of Shifidi.

- When concerned namibians as-
sisted workers to bind together in
defence of their rights, their lives, -
an action which culminated in the —
organised workers movement sec- —
ond to none in the history of Namibia —
- your Cabinet moved in with bills to —
serve that initiative a death —

blow, and thanks to, yes, national
r | iy 1
law, and it was thus stillbom, re-
member? Remember the ILO expen-
ence when your cabinet was trying to
Jobby against the Namibian workers
for fear of ‘political manipulation’?
All your actions did not succeed be-
cause the workers were always astep
ahead of your cabinet.

Mr Shipanga, if this is not ‘na-
tional campaigns , what is?

(b) International campaigns:

Well, inthe interest of spacc I shall
not dwell, because after all itis obvi
OUuS:

- thatitis because of intemational
diplomatic and economic pressure
on the government in South Africa
that your TGNU was not recognised
by a single country as such.

- that the South Afncan Rand has
and continues to plunge, to the extent
thal (as you correcuy pomt out) South
Afnca had to recognise that it cannot
continue to enforce her preferences
through intermediaries of her unilat-
eral choice; and that the cost of re-
taining control has come to, and in
fact has long exceeded, the benefit.

It is in this Context interesting to
note what South African Minister of
Finance, Barend du Plessis, said in a
recent interview in Leadership (a South
African journal),

Mr du Plessis was asked a question
on sanctions and he said: (paraphrased)
the question of sanctions is rather
delicate to discuss because, if you
say they are not working, you are
inviting more; and if you say they are
working, you are inviting more.

This | think is indicative of inter-
national diplomatic and economic
| pressure on South Africa. Suffice it
| to quickly add that national and in-
- termational campaigns are necessar-
ily complementary.

ment in camera. But | do know that

nomic pressure on South Africa, and
I know that such pressure has come

Finally I am surprised that Mr
Shipanga only now sees it fittomvite
me to join hands with other Namibi-
ans to build the son of country of
which we can all be proud, while he
knows that it was my commitment

Mr Shipanga knows that when he

Reply to Shipanga

THIS letter follows one by Mr
Vezera Kandetu (The Namibian
Jamuary 14 1989) and to the reply by
Mr Andreas Shipanga. I was going to
stat my mouth al this ume, and merely
hope that the future would bring me
and fellow Namibians the best.

When Shipanga joined the TGNU
he knew very well that they would be
tesponsible to the Government of
South Africa, and he chose to fight
for freedom, liberty and self-deter-
mination with the South African
Government, with Botha ‘leading the
revolution’ and the Administrator
General es the man in charge of the
socalled ‘defenders’ of the nghts of
Nanubians.

What does Shipanga mean when
he says ‘It is just this sort of hubns
which has hampered the struggle for
truc liberation in Namibia forsolong
and encouraged the armchair revolu-
lionaries to waste their words and
deeds on irtelevancies’.

To tell the truth, Shipanga is one of
those who hampered the struggle for
true Liberation if he remembers what
he did in 1978: he divided the froe-
doen fighters. And the description in
question fis him very well. Lei me
say, he has been an annchair revolu-

tionary who hes been wasting his
words and deeds, by way of
tb Namiblen people along nie
Eeeets, Th potio of he and his

colleagues made the South African
Government realise that they could
not enforce its rule through Namib-
ian intermediaries, and so they went
to the negotiating table.

The TGNU never had the power to
decide, and the South Afncan Gov-
emment got what it wanted from the
interim government.

Swapo would like united people as
itis their mMouo to unite the Namibian
people. But how can it succeed in
uniting the people if there are those
hike yourself who are always divid-
ing the nation. Swapo will unite and
join hands with fellow Namibians in
order to build up the nation you dis-
appointed, and the beloved land you
betrayed.

On the question of your call on
Swapo to release the detainces it is
holding, that is none of your busi-
ness. After all, some of these things
are already provided for in accor-
dance with UNSCR 435 (1978) and
629 (1989), and all dates and events
are based upon the Annex to the
settlement Proposal S/12636 of Apni
10 1978, just in case the South Afri-
can Government hasn't bnefed you.

Why didn’t the intenm govern-
ment repeal laws such as AG 26:
many Namibians have been detained
without trial, and the interim govern-
ment did not question this.

There are no atrocities in Swapo
camps; and it was you who started

Lost manhood
A WORD or two to all Namibi-

democracy and peace in this

To a large extent the evil-doers
have succeeded in producing, at
the output end of their machine, a
kind of black man who is man
only in form. This is the extent to
which the process of dehumanisa-
tion has advanced. The type of
black man we have today has lost
his manhood. In the privacy of
his ‘pondok’ his face twists in
silent condemnation of while
ari Li reagatsehy dag

ish obedience as he comes out
hurrying in response to his mas-
ter’s impation call. Sometimes
he joins the chorus that roundly
condemas the white masters, bul

shell: t0 infuse him with pride
and dignity: to remind him of his
complicity t in the crime of allow-

ing himself to be misused and
therefore letting evil reign su-
preme in the country of his birth.

This is what we mean by an in-
ward-looking process.

Brothers and sisters who are
still in the police force, security
forces and puppet government:
stop betraying your people. Our
mothers and fathers are the past;
we are the present, and our sons
and daughters the future.

Lost manhood

A WORD or two to all Namibi-
ans, black and white, who want
democracy and peace in this
country.

To a large extent the evil-doers
have succeeded in producing, at
the output end of their machine, a
kind of black man who is man
only in form. This is the extent to
which the process of dehumanisa-
uon has advanced. The type of
black man we have today has lost
his manhood. In the privacy of
his ‘pondok’ his face twists in
silent condemnation of white
society, but bnightens up in sheep-
ish obedience as he comes out
hurrying in response to his mas-
ter's impatient call. Sometimes
he joins the chorus that roundly
condemns the white masters, but
is first to praise the South African

INTHE last edition of The Nemib-
ion and some other newspaper, I had
the opportunity to read what some
ssembers of the SADF were saying
about comnasenian. Before I say
anything about the subject, I would
like to mform readers that I was born
and brought up in the communis!
state of Yugoslavia. I might add that
while living and working m mry home
town I had always refused offers to
become a member of the Communist
Party.

According to what these army
members say, which can also be taken
as the gencral opmion of Namibian
whites, particularly farmers, com-
munism means dictatorship which
includes the killing pf polincal oppo-
nents, oppréssion, exploitation, pov -
exty and others abuses of human nghis.

Many of them regard anyone who
opposes the apartheid system and
white mmonty rule as a communist
or even, terrorist. I belseve that these
that this socio-political system in
which we live, or have been forced to
live, 1s one of the best. Onc thing is
sure, it is some kind of capitalism.

It is as unwise to say: Chnstianity
is better than Islam or the other way
around, as it is to say or think that
capitalism is better than communism
Or vice versa.

Of course any soci-polincal struc-
ture benefits someone profitably. If
we compare communismos and capt-
talismos, let's say according to the
number of private-owned cars and
television seis, we will have the
impression that capitalism is much
better. But if you look at other things
m the capitalist society, like the number
of suicides, drug seddicts, kidnap-
pings and terrorist attacks, then we
have another picture. It seems to me
that people in the capitalist world are
not so free and happy. Life under
communism is safer and better.

We must also not fail to give atten-
tion to job security in communist
states where it is very difficult to fire
workers from their jobs. Here in
Namibia the firing of workers is

‘normal

If we wanttoleam the facts we will
notice that communism by itself is
not some kind of poverty-maker. In
many communist-ruled states, living

standards are much higher than in
non-communist states; take for ox-
ample Latin America or the Phillipi-

1 nes. None of them are ruled by the

communists but there ero so many
body in the USSR today has enough
food and clothing. | am convinced
that even in the most communist
stales, ciuzens enjoy more democ-
racy, more freedom and more justice
than the majonty here in Namibia.
The waves of protest in the commu-

nist countnes today, like the one in |
Poland, is not directed against the |

communist system itself. The Soli-
danty Union in Poland is not an anu-
communist movernent, which is trying
to destroy the Polish socio-political
structure. In fact, the union leaders
are better communists than thei rulers.

To many of those who so strongly
cTiacise the communist way of life,
communism and marxism mean the
same thing, which 1s also wrong.
Somebody can be communist and

not manust; he can be Stalmist, Maoist |

elc.

I myself do not adhere to any ide-
ology. I concern myself as a Chns-
lian only, but to be a good believer
and Christian does not mean to be
ready to kill communists and non- |
believers.

Rather it is to mean to work to-
gether and work in peace and har-
mony. If we are not prepared to do |

this, our future is bleak. To try to |

bring people to your side by creating
a fear of the unknown is primitive
and cheap propaganda, which as such
is not a part of Western civilisation
which the SADF claims to defend.

I WISH to express my heartfelt
sadness at the irresponsible attitude
of Untag in Namibia from April 1.

I am disappointed in Untag in
general and Mr Martti Ahtisaari, for
their unwillingness to perform their
duties as expected of them by the
Namibian people.

On April 1, a peaceful march of
the Namibian workers under leader-
ship of NUNW was forcefully stopped
by colonial, heavily armed police in
the absence of Untag police who are

Supposed to accompany them. Thanks
lo the disciplined actions of the
workers themselves, injuries and
bloodshed was avoided since the
colonial police were under strict
command to act against the 15 0(XK)-
strong crowd if they proceeded with
the march to hand over a petition
protesting privatisation of public
property to Mr Louis Pienaar, the
Administrator General.

After the well-attended Swapo rally
in Windhock on April 1, Swapo
ricmbers and supporters on their
way back north were shot al by two
white vigilantes. Seven people were
Injured, two senously. When a local
pastor went to report the incident to
Untag personnel in Tsumeb, he found
the officer in an inebnated.

The most buming issue, which
forced me to write this Ictter, was
when civilians when to Untag per-
sonnel in Oshakati to repon heavy
fighting between Plan and the colo-
nial army, the two Malaysian mem-
bers of Untag took no notice and
went on rcading their novels. Some
of them were seen SIPping wine with
South Afncan soldiers at Ondangue
and Oshakau. |] am wondering whether
Uiese intemational peacemakers are
really serious about what they are
doing in Namibia. I am also sur.

_ prised that certain countries agree to

assurances of their safety.

allow the notorious 10) and 202

On Ahtisaar!

PLEASE allow meto air my views
rogarding the position of Mr Martti
Ahtisaari in the current situation in
our country:

Sir, we are very perplexed by your
attitude tow ards our people under the
leadership of Swapo.

It is amazing that, as UN Special
Representative, who has come to
Namibia to make sure that the inter-
national procedures leading to inde-
pendence, are carried out with jus-
tice and without partiality to any
party, you have given the order to the
troops of South Africa to hunt down
forces who in fact were in the country
prior to the ceasefire.

This, to us who are yearning for
our freedom, clearly demonstrates
that you have taken apanial decision ‘|’
in favour of our colonisers. [tis a pity
that instead of bringing abwut peace,
you are encouraging the forces of the
racist’ government to eliminate
Namibians.

Swapo 1s a well-disciplincd move-
ment and would not defy the guide-
lines and regulations set up and agreed
to conceming our transition to inde-
pendence.

Insteac of deploying Untag
peacekeeping forces to the area of
conflict to separate the warring sides,
you decided in favour of the one side.
Swapo forces then had no alternative
but to defend themselves against those
who started hunting down our com-
batants.

Sir, if justice were to be done, you
would have acted impartially to
solvethe conflict. The Government
in Pretoria may have planned these
acts of violation in advance, to jeopar-
dise the peace process. They knew
long ago that anumber of Plan forces
were based inside Namibia. They
attacked our fighters on the day
implementation of the peace plan
started, and them put the blame on
our forces as the violators of the
peace process.

Then most of the world, including
Margaret Thatcher, started blaming
Swapo; they have most of the media
at their disposal. How can you decide
to assist the racist forces to expel

‘these bona fide sons of Namibia from
their own country? Angola is not

Gave their lives

AS ONE of the greatest fans of
your newspaper, allow me to air my
views conceming the recent clash
between Swapo combatants and South
Afncan security forces.

First of all, I take my hat off to
those freedom fighters who gave their
lives for us to be free. (Not only
them, but for South African security
forces who didn’t know what they
were doing, may God forgive them).
When I think of those who died, my
blood mins cold. Freedom was so
near and yet so far for them.

Secondly, the members of the UN
who were in favour of the reduction
of Untag from 7500 t0 4650, should
now bow their heads in shame. What
&@ great mistake it was.

According to eyewitnesses, the
security forces fired against the
combatants first. AndI believe them.
One may ask why? Because I cannot
believe someone, who, for 70 years,
has made me a subject of the evil
system called apertheid.
pepe pre Swapo. Why?

blamed because
fought beck in self-defence? Orie
because the US end its allics call

Swapo a ‘terrorist’ organisation?
Swapo is a liberation movement and
we are proud of it. According to
international law and the UN Char-
ter, we have the right to resist South
Afican occupation.

The Untag forces were supposed
to secure peace. Where were they?
The Botha’s are making fools of them.
The UN is now experiencing what we
have experienced for many years.

The Swapo combatants were re-
grouping to be confined to bases
when the security forces fired on
them. Who gave that instruction?
Botha or Ahtisaari?

Last but not least: Untag gives the
green light to South Africa to re-
deploy Koevoet and 101 Battalion to
assist them in their peacekeeping task.
Will a child's heart ever forget who
killed his mother? Will amother ever
forget who raped her ten-year-old
daughter? Some may forgive, but
they will never forget.

We will continue to resist our
occupation: Europe tasted Nazi oc-
cupation and opposed it. We have the
right to do the same.

Mudge and Kaura

. THEDTA Chairman Dirk Mudge,
saust clean his pwn house before he
| -ooks at those of others. We see DTA

- for reconciliation. We notice that the
DTA has chosen to fight against Swapo
rather than South Africa, which has
occupied the country formany years.

Mudge has also been making ac-
cusations about atrocities in Swapo
settlements, something he has no
evidence of. Yet he and his sapport-
ets appear to have Koevoet at their
disposal, who are the culprits as far
as atrocities in Namibia are con-
cerned. Mudge and Kaura are not
happy to see a Namibian nation
marching to freedom. They appear to
be perpetrating tribalism and divi-
sion among the people of this coun-

A few weeks ago K aura was inter-
viewed on the BBC where he claimed
that Swapo leaders were provoking
his supporters and he warned about
‘fights’ which may erupt in Katu-
tura. He also wamed Swapo leaders
that their safety may be jeopardised
if such ‘fights’ break out.

The anti-Swapo propaganda being
carried out by the DTA is the reverse
of the wuth. We have evidence that
the DTA is doing the very things they
accuse Swapo of.

Dirk Mudge and Kaura must real-
ise that in Swapo, they are dealing
with amovement whichis politically
mature. Swapo is not interested in
bringing Namibians into conflict or
the county into neo-colonialism, as
the DTA is doing.

Mudge and Kaura must control
their supporters not to provoke peace-
ful Swapo supporters any longer.
Swapo supporters do not interfere
with the affairs of other groups. Let
us campaign peacefully for the elec-
tions without intimidating anyone.
Mudge and Kaura must know what
the consequences of civil war is - that
is, if they have ready history. We in
Namibia do not want such a situation
here. Our people have suffered for
too long and they need peace and
freedom, which Swapo has and still
stands for.

With Plan fighters beyond the 16th

public. On April 30, security forces
came out of bases and intimidated
people, tearing down NUNW plac-
ards. Letting the SADF from con-
finement doesn't give peace a chance.

3. Residents are compelled to put
on DTA T-shirts and give DTA signs.
What about democracy?

4. Residents here are threatened if
they demonstrate the black power
salute.

5. We need more Untag offices in
the north to facilitate contact by ci-
vilans. In this way contact with Untag
could be made easier.

6. Untag lacks contact with resi-
dents - they should talk freely to
them and this would solve immedi-
ate problems.

Who's monitoring

Which is the monitoring force.

UNTAG or the South African Army?
1. It looks as if Mr Ahtisaari can-
not refuse or argue any request or
move put forward by the South Afn-
can government
1.1 After the security force at-
tacked the PLAN-fighters on April,

he allowed the South African ermy to
leave their bases for a large attack on
SWAPO fighters.

1.2 After the confinement of the
South African troops to their bases
for 60 hours, we find they had al-
ready left the bases before the des-
ignated 06h00 on April 29. They
started to fire allert shots during the
whole night of the 28th. The UNTAG
forces in the north will agree with
me. From 02h00 on the moming of
the 29th their Casspirs and Rattels
were on the road.

Why do they have to monitor the
withdrawal of the SWAPO fighters?
Will SWAPO fighters do the same
when they withdraw? What is the
UNTAG force doing here?

2.So many Koevocypolice are
deployed and moving around m
Northern Namibia in their Casspirs
amongst the people. Why don’t they
stay at their police stations? Is it
because because there is no room for
all of them? The whoke KOEVOET
was just give thename ‘police’. Why
keep such a big police force? Is is just
to distribute DTA pamflets, helping
in their campaign as they did on
April 29 at Othingo, on the west of
Oshakati and elsewhere?

3.Does Mr Ahtisaari know that
South Africa is doing all this to vio-
late Res 435? Does he know thar
South Africa wants to waste time
unt no more time is left and they
will come up with requests to with-
draw the peace plan?

Ahtisaari has falled

Forces making for dividing the
UN Special Representative, Mr Marthi
Ahtisaari, Magaret Thatcher, South
Africa, DTA, Koevoet and Action
Contra Res 435 have become forces
who want to divide the Namibians
for freedom, Jove, peace and unity.

Ahtisaari has failed in his mission,
like Dr Ercher, the Vice Sectetary
General of Kurt Waldheim in 1973.
Because the ends he served will take
him no further than himself.

It is SWAPO's deep conviction
thet all the people wish to be free and
that their desire for freedom is rooted

in the soul of every one of us. A

people long subjected\to foreighn ©

domination, however, does not al-
ways find it casy to translate that
wish into action. Under arbitrary rule,
people are apt to become lethargic,
theis senses are dulled. Fear becomes
the dominant force in their lives; fear
of breaking the colonial and apart-
heid laws.

SWAPO, who led the struggle for
freedom, broke through this apathy
and fear. We gave active expression
to the universal longing to be free.

Our leaders strenghten the peoples’
faith in themselves, and cncourgec
them to take part in the freedom
struggle.

I am convinced the unity of the
Namibians outweigh those who di-
vide us.

Forward with the struggle.

Since the heyday of Pretoria's
regime in Namibia has left a dis-
graceful page in the Namibian his-
tory by dividmg the entire nation into

destruction and brutalization, peace-
thristy Namibian people have been
waiting for the truc leader to bring
about the total eradication of foreign

As the days of indeperdence ap-

<a Sam Naujoma, who heroically

succeeded in lead-
meterragte people of Namibia
in their Long and hot struggle against
the Pretoria racist regime and its

allies of the entire capitalist block for
almost 29 years. In this way, the
Tespected great leader President
Nujoma has achieved a great respect
among the Namibian people, as well
as internationally.

The Namibian people ecclaim the
SWAPO great leader president Sam
Nujoma as thei genuine people's
leader who will create the new state
of Namibia with prospenty, peace,
democracy, natonal security, justice
and social economics.

Therefore, the nanon is bemg called

nation to stand firmly against the
enemy's anticSWAPO psychologi-

enuy carried out by the so-called
security force so that they can mis-
lead the people from choosing their
genuine people's leader because they
are afraid of SWAPO'S inevitable
victory in the forthcoming elections.

THE tong yearned-for Namibian
after more than 70
years of South African rule, is clearly
visible. But prospects toward a lJast-
ing peace m a future independent
Namibia, and the entire region of
southern Africa, is still miles away.
There are two major areas of concem
- the status of Walvis Bay and the
Angolan war.

Walvis Bay, Namibia's only deep
ocean-gomg port, poses a single major
threat to any post-independent gov-
emment in Namibia as long as South
Afnca continues its claim over the
port. Despite the United Nations rul-
ing that Walvis Bay is an intcgral
part of Namibia, Pretona continues
to regard and treat the nortas part and
parcel of South Afric}.

Walvis Bay is not only a vital
anchorage for imports and exports,
but provides a large military basc
and airstnp for South Afnca to con-
tinue its destabilising tactics against
the neighbounng black African states.
This will enable South Africatokcep
war away from its mainland. No
county has so far dared to launch a
direct attack on the South African
mainland while South Africa has used
illegally occupied Namubia as a spring-
board for its periodic incursions into
southem Angola.

Walvis Bay has even greater im-
plications in terms of its relationship
to a fubure independent Namibia. Since
the port is part of South Afnica, those
Namubians residing in Swakopmund
and elsewhere will need to have visas
to leave and enter the port. And a
horde of Walvis Bay residents em-
ployed at the Rossing Uranium Lid,
outside Swakopmund, will have to
periodically renew their visas to en-
ter and leave the port on their way to
and from work.

Also, the SA officials travelling by
road to Walvis will need to apply for
visas to leave and enter Namibian
territory. Walvis Bay also stands as a
potential cover for any opponents of
a new Namibian government, and
might as well provide for their base.

And the fact that Pretoria and its

nrogates might use Walvis Bay as

had nothing to guarantee an end to
the Angolan civil war or reduce US
aid to Unita. This can only be weighed
against the fact that it is pretty much
within the interest of the west. or the
US, to have Jonas Savimbi in power
in Angola.

The war in Angolais thus nota war
of liberation, but a struggle for power.
The US justifies its support for Unita
as a way to ‘combat Soviet expan-
sionism’’. Hence the fear exists that
a new born Namibian nation might
80 pro-cast, and in the lightof this the
“crusade against Soviet expansion-
ism""’ will continue. The misguided
belief that the Russians are bent on
‘world conquest’ has given nse to
one of the twentieth century miscon-
cepuons: whenever the third world
nations rise and make a Claim, they
they must have been told by some-
body else - if not the Americans, then
the Russians.

This limits the world in terms of
east and west, and undermines the
sovereignity of other cxisting na-
tions. Henceforth, there is nothing
that rules out the possibility that any
adversaries of anew Namibian gOv-
ermment will find a helping hand in
America and be used as instruments
to make trouble in the interests of the
west.

Zaire provides an excellent ex-
ample of western stranglehold on a
developing third world nation.

It makes me sad when | see how

uy their best to make it succeed.

This is an histoncal event, which
our children and future genesations
are going to learn about in the class-
rooms.

There are many powerful forces in
Namibia working to see the process
fail and war and suffering start again.
They are the forces which, in the
past, were never in favour of inde-
pendence, and were planning some
sort of independence of their own
without internauonal recognition.

The South Afncan Government
was never serious about 435 and its
posiuon is sull unchanged. South
Afnica really intended to reduce the
high cost of the Angolan war and
switch it to Namibia, which is much
cheaper. This is only possible with
its faithful puppets which have long
experience in doing ‘dirty work’.

We know, and Pretoria knows even
better, that it is impossible to hold a

Atraid of liars

IN Oshiwambo there is a proverb
which says: Omufundji oku vule
omulodhi. It means a har is worse
than a witch. The saying continues: It
is better to accomodate a witch than
a lier.

Lhave been baling to understand
the proverb of my ancestors. My
question has been, why did they look
upon liars with apprehension? (1 pould
be happy if someone could give fur-
ther clarification).

For many years we have been oul-
side our beloved motherland - parted
from our parents, sisters, brothers,
friends and comrades. We havc al-
ways becn dreaming of home.

It also pasned us when we were
told that some of our relatives or
fnends penshed in the bloody 23.
year war. Therefore, we understand
what it meant when some of our
fellow compatnots were told that
their nextof kin were ‘eliminated’ by
Swapo. These lics have caused
immense damage and confusion.

Maybe our ancestors were afraid
of liars because what they said did
not only affect a limited number of
people, but the entre population. A
witch destroys only one or two poople,
and then that is the end.

When liars speaks of death, they
mean life; when they speak of de:
mocracy, they mean tyranny, justice
= injusucc, reconstruction = destruc-
tion, freedom = oppression or captiv-
ity, decolonisation = colonisation,
freedom from South Afnca = de-
pendence on South Afnca.

These are the people who nearly
destroyed the Namibia peace process
by concocting lies that Swapo com-
batanis infiltrated Namibia on Apni
1, while many of them had been in-
side already.

Lies were fabricated again when it
was reported that Swapo combatants
were moving south of the sixicenth

into Namibia - an absurd statement
indeed.

ALLOW me to be an ethnicist at this
moment by introducing myself as a
Caprivian amd a proud ‘Mafwe' for that
taattez. | wish to cxpress concern about
my fellow ‘Mafwes’ who are support-
ocs of the DTA. I am prood, and do not
heaitate to mention thet the Mafwe are
people with « definite culture who
strive for good mora! norms aad codes.
Theeefor what the DTA is doing is not

ton, Chat is, beating other poopie, chal-
lengiog them with dangerous woapons

_ This is aot only a crime but also

took place ot Mekangs, Sinywebuna,

otc. | wonder what it moans when oar
respected Mafwe tribal authority toler-
ates such actons | wonder
whether the Tealises the reper-
cussions for itself.

However, let me sound a warning to
fellow Namibians, particularly the
DTAs. Just as God liberated the Leraelis
from the bondage of slavery to the
Egyptians, God is now going to liberate
His sons, the Namibians, from the yoke
of bondage from SA colonial rule.
Never mind how stubbom Pharaoh
was, the fact remains thai the Israelites
were liberated from Egypt as God de-
cided. Never mind how stubbom the
South Afncans/DTA may be, the fact
remains Namibia will be free.

I have a strong conviction that any-
one who stands in the way of God will
be drowned in the Red Sea This isa
good warning to the DTA.

Mr Martti Abtisasri and his team
represent Moses in the peace process:
“History repeats itself’.

Fellow Namibians and fellow Ca-
privians, fellow Mafwes and the DTA:
““T kanda ka i li twikiwe’': thas is, you
Cannot put the country on your bead. It
is beavy and will break your neck.

We know the DTA was totally
against the implementation of Resolu-
bon 435. We call on this organisation
ot to involve itself in the peace proc-
ess with a manner of pretence, aiming
to disrupt and cause the process to fail.
It must not come owt with dirty ticks
and strategies of using the sadicals of
the community and school dropouts to
prevent the process from being run in
the letter and spirit of 435.

Itis a good sign of ignorance to see a

when it comes to power?

On the other hand people are ques-

work with both good and bad elements.
A parent socepts all its children. So let
us all come together under Swapo; jet
us avoid fighting ome another, let us
know who the real enemy is.

Finally I want to call on the Mafwe to
sec to it that poople are disciplined and
that they respect and love one another.

things in the Masubia arcas? Does this

Why is it that the DTA is ‘coura.

but not against colonialism?

We believe that we are onc people
and the same family of Namibia's
children. We have no reason to fight
against our brothers, and we have
extended the hand of peace and rec-
onciliation to unite the people of this
nation and to bring the counry to

The DTA is being used by the
South African regime to cause chaos
and create a situation conducive for
civil war, after which they can inter-
vene.

Even the Bible says if someone
slaps your cheek, then tum the other
cheek, but what happens if they slap
that one as well? I am sure that the
answer would be to retaliate in self
defence.

The DTA must know that Swapo

is not afraid of them, but is
avoiding them because we want peace
and freedom. We do not want war.

THE future of the country is being
shaped NOW ... don’t you want to
partake?

This question I wish to pose to all
my white compatriots who regard
Namibia as their home country and
who want their children and grand-
children to live here peacefully and
prosperously ; and to thos! who are in
the privileged position to influence
the economic and social develop-
ment of our country after independ-
ence, but who foresee darkness and
insecurity in the future.

During these past decades we have
consistently ignored or distorted
certain realities in our country (and
the press has played its major part)
until they became facts in our his-
tory. After all, the process of inde-
pendence has begun, Resolution 435
is being implemented and the Swapo
leadership and even its President,
Sam Nujoma, did return from exile.

Let us look at some aspects of the
present situation:

Election campaign and inumida-
tion: This is the first general election
in this country, and aggressive and
‘unacceptable behaviour by incited
party members can be expected. But
we are very fortunate, as the sole
country in Africa, to gain independ-
ence through the process of an extgn-
sive plan, and we cap be grate-
ful the process ti progressing
: “In spite of all predictions, the
guerrilla fighters do not practice in-
timidation at the pomt of the gun
and maintain a rather strict disci-
pline. Great respect can also be ex-
tended to Swapo for its restrained
reaction to the assassination of An-
ton Lubowski, the most provocative
incident thus far. Let us hope that the
recent increase in violence will not
escalate to an unmanag({able level.
Election result: Most parties have
resorted to an anti-Swapo election
campaign on a very low level. In-
stead of informing the clectorate of
future programmes, aims, policies
etc, they attack other parties and do
not hesitate to instill fear and hatred,
often based on lies. The shocking
incidents of April 1, and the un-
solved question of Swapo dissident
camps have put oil on the flames of
general accusations. As much as we
would like to put a finger on certain
issues and condemn certain acuons,
we should not become blind to the
fact that for the majority of Namibi-
aris Swapo is still the party of the
future. Swapo will win the election.
Will we be able to live with that? I
think we can - if we are prepared to
contribute as true Namibians.
Reconciliation: For the past few
years, Swapo has been following 4
course of reconciliauon among
Namibians.
The former struggle should not
| perpetuate as a conflict between black
SY 5555 WE Cb a
The former struggle should not
as a conflict between black
and white but should terminate as a
conflict between the South African
colonial power and the Namibian
population. Not only al the biggest
political rally in Namibia, on Sunday
September 24, has Nujoma offered
reconciliation and cooperation. This
gesture was not motivated byu the
wish to gain the votes of the whites.
Swapo does not depend on these votes
to win the election. It is rather based
on the willingness to learn from the
experiences of other African coun-
tries and is guided by the aim of a
peaceful and stable future for all
Namibians.

Appeal: I would like to appeal to
all, to recognise and accept the real}-
ties, and not to be deceived by ide-
ologists, politicians and a one-sided
press. See, hear and think for your-
self.

Accept the offer of reconciliation
and cooperation instead of sneering,
spreading false rumours or laughing
about distasteful pamphiets. Grab the
Opportunity at this point of history
and regard the coming independence
as a challenge rather than a threat.
You can become involved at all lev-
els, and it is important everywhere. It
is necessary in our daily relations
with other people.

Talk about fears and negative
expectations, but also understand and
share the anticipated joy of many
Namibians about an independent
Namibia.

- Great challenges lie ahead for all
- professionals and experts to contnib-
ute to the development of Namibia.
Ever so often economical questions
are being discussed during which
businessmen just shrug their shoul-
ders or show their dismay. These
economists too, are challenged to
accept the realities. Contribute, by
sharing your knowledge and expen-
ence, to the formulation of a new
economic policy.

-: ~The times of ‘‘alles-sal-regkom""’
are past. We need creativily and
imagination, idealism and visions for
the shaping of a future Namibia. So
offer your expertise and positive
involvement NOW!

Botha’s threat

I PERCEIVED with dismay the
threatening statement made by South
African Foreign Affairs Minister,
Roelof Botha, on his recent visit to
Windhoek to the effect that “if any-
thing unforeseen happens between
now and Namibian independence,
which violates any of the agreed
principles his government reserved
the right to take whaicver stcps it

doomed necessury’’.

1 would like to remind the colonisers
that we did not invite South Africa to
invade our beloved Namibia and
subject it to colonialism and all that
gocs with it, and their presence here
has aiways been illegal, nor did we
consent to the German fascism of
von Trotha.

We fought back tooth and nail
against these forces unul today when
the deeply yeamed-for freedom and
independence 1s about to be born.

We know South Afnca is not
committed to genuine implementa-
tion of 435, and if it was not for the
heavy burden of war, which the oc-
cupier could not sustain, then the
future of this country would stil] be
locked in chains.

If any ‘unforeseen’ happens in this
country, as Mr Botha fears, then it
wil undoubtedly be the fault of Pre-
tora. Namibians are peace loving
people who have no intenuon of
invading other nations or neighbours.

Mr Botha should restrain his forces
and cease their clandestine activi-
tics. South Africa must not attempt
to create a pretext to invade this
country to perpetuate colonialism or
insutute neo-colomalism.

It is unacceptable for the SADF or
SAP to retum to our soil under any
circumstances.

They should be restrained and
disciplined. This nation does not want
the smell of blood while striving for
peace, stability and the nght lo na-
hionhood,

AN advertisement placed in this

sociation for the Handicapped in

states: ‘Let Namibia not start a de-

I appreciate the fact that the Direc-

of the fact that he wants to ‘save
lives, prevent disability, devclop
Namibia, and above all, obey God's
will’. However, I do not agree with
the idea that in order for our country
to develop we should not have a
defence force.

Sure ‘Namibia has impressed the
world with the first-ever democratic
election in Africa’, bul let us not be
naive and unrealistic by being blind
to the possible destabilising forces
that surround our country. To those —
whose normal lives are continually

protect our peace, democracy and

force, our country 15 casy prey. The
concept of demilitarisation can only

be realistic if it encompasses all
neighbouring countries, especially
South Africa. There also must be
democracy and peace in South Af-
rica and Angola for this Utopia to be
realised.

Lastly, a defence force does nol
necessarily have to be destructive. It
can be constructive especially if itis
defensive in nature rather than offen-
sive. While a deterrent force, its
personnel and infrastructure can be
employed in development projects.

Therefore a defence force should
not be perceived as an anti-develop-
ment force or a threat to Namibians
but rather as a source of pride and
security to our country and all ats

of three white residents of Grootfon-
tem. He further wondered why the
murders had occurred after the adop-
ton of the constitution of the Repub-
lic of Namibia.

Chief Riruako seemed to be out of
wach with events in Namibia. The
killing of irmocent people has been
common and prevalent, especially in
the north all along since the election.
Many people were robbed af gun-
point of their properties and animals
and people killed in the process.

These incidents were reported ‘in

and never called a press conference
to denounce killings, armed robbery
etc in the north part of our country,
bui anly when they happened in Groot-
fontein. What hypocrisy on the part
of he DTA President!

In the spirit of national reconcili-
ation, the sput of Namibia demands
that we build a nation hand in hand,
irrespective of colour, race, religion
or ethnic, regional or party affili-
ations.

Lastly, Chief Riruako accused
Swapo and the AG who “‘had put
Swapo in the position of government

inaugurated as the new government!
It 1s not Swapo or the AG which had
pul Swapo in government. Swapo
was elected, and the AQ, as the rep-

would be the last person to put the
movement in government.

Chief Riruako must know that itis
the people of this country who hate
colonialism and sec their salvation in
Swapo that put Swapo in govern-

A big headache

THE opporunists among Namibians
-could cause a big headache for our future
government,

It seems to me thal most white Namibi-
ans with an opportunistic nature are those
in the ‘pnvate business sector’ and blacks
are mostly former members of SWATF,
particularly 10] Battalion.

It is sad, and at the same time logical,
that some of the 101 former soldiers are
not prepared to terve their country in a
new Namibia defence force, domanding
same of mora money than they got
tha colonial regimes.
this ls ‘Logical’ to me is because if

they were not opportunists they would
have refused to jom enemy forces in the
‘first place.

What salaries were paid to our Namib-
ian heroes, Swapo Plan combatants who
fought for so long to liberate Namibians
from the oppressive South African re-
gime, including the SWATF members?
Do they feel no shame?

If they were in Romania they would
serve life sentences or be executed by
firing squad. If they think they can get
more money elsewhere, they are free lo
look for better paid jobs.

It is their democratic nght to say no.

As far as | know Namibians there are
cnough men and women who are ready at
any lime to secure our freedom, to guard
our borders and protect our peace and
defend our democracy, filled with a spirit
of reconciliation and forgiveness, willing
to work and serve the new-borm Namibian
nation.

Long live Namibian patnots!

Fighting chiefs

THE tume has come for Chief Moral-

case has not been solved by the
Supreme Court and that his ancestors
were not the first to settled in the
Eastern Capnvi. The Cinef and his
elements should then be prepared for
Ins claim that he 1s the (Munitenge)
supreme ruler, custodian and para-
mount chef in the East Caprivi at the
expense of his counterpart.

Chief Moraliswam has been the
plannff in the border/chneftainstup
case for a long tirfe. It is time, now
tbat we are independent, to ask the
Honourable President, as a neutral
person, tohelp resol ve the issue once
and for all so that both Chiefs respect
ome another and restore peace in the
region. The Chief ahould face reality
now. He knows very well how ex-
pensive the court case has been for
both Masubia and Mafwe factions.
People were forced to contnbute
because of his actions.

He obviously thought that by tak-
ing the case to court he would be the
victor. It is for these reasons I want
him to sit down and account for what
he has done. He has sown hatred and
mistrust instead of uniting the people,
as the role of chief should be. I see the
Chief now gives a clenched fist sa-
lute; as far as I witnessed, he was a
UDF and later an NPF supporter in
the pac.

It is my wish that the President
should solve this problem to help the
two chiefs to know their tribal juns-
dictions. Caprivi will not be the first
region to be demarcated, but chiefs
in other regions know their jurisdic-
tion and that is why there are no
senseless claims in other areas.

I once again appegl to the govern-
ment of the day to come up here and
show each chief where he begins and
ends so that the one cannot claim
supremacy over the other.

THE nonsense about Plan ‘gangs’ in
the north has come to my attention.
For the past weeks Plan combatants
have been deployed in the province
of cnticism by joumalists who in-
vent stones in order to supply copy
for professional vendors of political
slander un this country.

_ The matter was also brought up by
Mr Enc Biwa (NPF) in Parliament
and others who expressed concen
about the detenorating secunty situ-
ation 1n the north.

The electorate expect the Parhia-
ment to attack buming issues in the
country like education, health, un-
employment, houses etc.

Certain members of Parhament are
apparently insensitive to the fact that
Namibia is a newly-bom nation,
emerging from the debris of apart-
heid colomalism. The time for shabby
politics has gone. The time is now for
realism and people are waiting for
concrete and constructive program-
més which will assist the long down-
trodden nation in realising its hopes
and aspirations.

We are all affected when there is
lawlessness in any part of the coun-
try. As the opposition is concerned,
so is the Government. Our President
has also expressed his government’s
concem about the breakdown of law
and order and the Minister of Home
Affairs deployed extra police units
along the border.

The problem is that the situation is
not being presented in the right per-
spective in Certain quarters. What I
have learned from the people in the
affected area, is totally different to
Mr Biwa's assertion. The citizens of
the region are concermed about the
fact that Unita elements are threaten-
ing both their safety and their prop-
erty.

So I say ‘hands off Plan’, the
members of which have endured alot
of suffering to achieve peace and
freedom in this country.

There are people who present bar-
riersto the buming desire for change.

On forgiveness

TRY forgiving a friend who betrays
a confidence, or a co-worker who
tells lies about you. When the real
effort of forgiveness takes place, there
is nothing easy about it. Instinct urges
us to pay back in kind.
Some people are capable of heroic
effort in reconciling; others not. There
is usually a pause between the hurt
and the time when trust and love can
take root again. Forgiveness is part
of a process that begins with hurt and
ends, inits final goal, with reconcils-
ation.
It works only when we become aware
of the depths and causes of the ange!
burning in us so that we can forgive
wholeheartedly and ensure anendur-
ing peace.
Too often, we bypass forgiveness
entirely. We race from our hurt to an
arent reconciliation without tak-
ing stock of what must truly be for-
given before lasting healing can take
place. We try to get past the difficult
part too quickly,“for we have been
pro since childhood to keep
a stiff upper lip, pretend that we are
unaffected by the cruelty of others,

whether deliberate or accidental.
The ability to reconcile cannot be
Tushed. We owe if to one another to
offer time to confront our hurts, to
face our wounds head-on, to vent our
emotions. Only then can the real
healing begin.

When Jesus said ‘love your enemy’,
he meant every word of it. We never
get rid of an enemy by meeting hate
with hate; we get nd of an enemy by
getting rid of enmity.
Reconciliation depends on the situ-
alion and the people involved. In the
end, all forgivers do the same thing:
they restore self-worth to the of-
fender; they cancel a debt; they expe-
rience such peace that they lose the
urge to retaliate and live as freer
persons unshackled by the weight of
a hurt.

ommend that he initiates a meoting
between soccer administrators and
the police to work oul ways and
means to ensure thal soccer specta-
tors can enjoy the game in peace and

lice will explain their position and
their dilemma.

RECONCILIATION is not a matter
of speeches or open letters in news.
Papers. Reconciliation is an act of
coming towards one another, tallas3
to one another, looking together fut
the problem which is facing us and
finding a solution for it, so that we
can be truly reconciled and live to-
gether in peace. Accusations will
divide us more and make reconcili-
ation difficult to achieve.

The article in the CCN newsletter to
which Ms Regina Gerises is refer-
ring was written by Reverend K
Vermeulen. He w addressing the
question of reconciliation between
black and white and quoted what I
said in that regard. To refer to that
article as a ‘proof’ that I only sce
reconciliation in terms of white and
black, is to take the nearest stick to
hit a dog.

At numerous occasions in public
meetings and in private discussions
my stand was an is that we must
openly discuss and resolve the ques-
tions surrounding the serious and
sensitive issue of ALL missing, de-
tained and dead Namibians, so that
we can be truly reconciled and re-
build our nation together in peace.
I therefore applaud the unanimous
decision of the Parliament to request
the Prime M‘nister after consultation

sion which will investigate this issue

To the Generals

DURING the years of illegal occupa-
tion by South Africa, J, as a resident
of Suiderhof, had problemis with the
armed forces living next door to me.
The officer commanding the base
lived across the road from my home,
and every time a black person en-
tered my premises, he would give me
a ‘show of force’ and spit in the street
to show his resentment.

Every Friday morning one would
bear sergeant majors shouting at ‘sleg
troepe’ refusing to polish their boots
or behaving ina disorderly fashionin
public. Later a certain so-called
coloured battalion moved in and the
abuse continued. Being a keen gar-
dener in those days at six in the
moming I received a whole run-down
Oo army events for free.

Later still, we have 10-tonne trucks
hurtling down our road (Palm Street)
after someone blew up the SAWI
supermarket situated inside the base.

The main gate of the base was closed

and the side ontrance which leads
NN ee

into suburbia became the main high-
way for the amy.

Then they began to use a siren for
wakiny up the troops

My constan: calls to virally
everyone mn the army led to me be
conmuoy ery unpopular wath the
Windhock-based nulitary. But the
sien system was eveotually aban
doned

On independence | stood in my
garden and spatin the street as the
commander moved out to South
Afnca!

But my dlusions af peace were
shattered when the LIN moved in,
and among others, the Kenyans in-
sisted on being physically fit and
faking the battalion for a run down
Palm Street every momung. Every
white-owned dog in the area went
bananas, as the troops ran past in
heavy boots.

But my story has not ended...

Two weeks ago, after a heavy Fn-
day mght, I fell into bed, and at
O5h00 my nightmare began. Out of
the base came the deep wail of a
bombing siren. I leapt from my bed
and jumped for my pants, images of
Kassinga and Ngiva pounding in my
head. 1 stumbled onto the lawn ex-
pecting chaos, but it was only the
troops being woken up.

Nothing has changed. The base is
still there, slap~bang in the middle of

suburbia. In the early momings, the
air-raid siren goes off.

Could T make a suggestion: that
whoever woes on duty at the base
knocks on bungalow doors to wake
up Loops, of gets the troops to wake
themselves up! Please, this is not
war-tom Angola but good old Suid-
erhof suburbia. As a homeowner near
the base, T ask those in charge to
show consideration for residents.

In the past we canvassed against
military bases in residential areas,
and while the forme: mulers were not
sympathetic, we would have thought
that our new Government would be
more considerate.

ALTHOUGH the word reconciliation
has been created with the purpose of
forgiveness, peace and unity for all

I WOULD like to comment on the |
pew organizations that have recently
been formed, namely, the TUN
(Teachers Union of Namibia) andthe |
NASEM (the Namibian Student
Education Movement).

Firstly, I would like to deal with |
the new student body. In regard to its
claims that it has been formed asa
‘‘seeutt of a leadership vacuum within |
the student community in Namibia""’ |
and, secondly, that the existing stu-
dent organizations have failed to

*‘proper leadership for
students because of their
Hoke with political parties’, I would
ttke to malice the following comments.

Eis no mirprise to me to read such

an atticle because this is the case and

THE NAMIBIAN

bean to mislead and infuse ideas of
the past colonial administrations. In
my point of view, the student! move-
ment has boon formed to foster the
interests and political ideals of their
respective political parties who are
at present on ‘death row’.

They see clearly that Nanso, which
has been a progressive student or-
ganization in the past, has won a
victorious fight against the regimo
thar illegally occupied our country, |
and which suppressed most of the
students and people of Namibia.

There was no leadership vacuum |
in Nanso. This can be proved by its
winning of the objectives it stood for.
Nanso members and supporters have
been harassed, detained and even
expelled from schools because of
their political beliefs and quest for
freedom. To say that Nanso has failed |
to serve student inferests, is mere |
bias. Nanso leadership succeeded in
mobilizing students all over the
country. It made them realize that
their interests were being suppressed
and needed to be fought for. Nanso’s
liberation standpoints, therefore, |
coincided with those of Swapo and |

|

Nantu.

Nanso could not isolate itself from
Swapo because they had common
goals to achieve. To fight a war in
disunity is to give the enemy victory
and therefore students needed to be |
linked in order to be free, get better
education, proper housing, and well-
equipped libranes, etc.

Nanso did not look for or concen-
trate on student issues alone, mainly
because the dignity of the whole naton
was undespinned by the colonial
regime. Asa student body consisting
of intellectuals, ithadtotake account |
of the socio-economic situation in °
the country. Students cannot only be
freo at school and ‘unfree’ when they

go home. Both students and their
parents needed to be liberated.
Tam assuring the leadership of the

this nation from foreign domination
and influence. I appeal to the new
organization not to create confusion
among students countrywide. We
know whose interests they represent
and promote. They must stop swim-
ming in the pool of confusion. Their |
organization was formed to counter-
act Nanso that has stood firm in
opposition to the abuse of bnman
rights.

My question to them is: if Nanso
failed to achieve what it fought for
and a leadership vacuum does exist,
then what have they achieved so far?

If you were serious, why didn’t
you form that organizatian months
ago, lo stand up against Koevoet
elements which used to disrupt les-
sons, beat up students, and erect army
bases al schools?

With regard the formation of the
TUN: it also has political motives in
their formation, which serve the same
purpose as that of the NASEM.

¢ organization has not been
formed to strive for teachers’ umity
and interests but to counteract Nantu.

Tappeal to teachers country wide to
be careful and cautious before join-
ing any altemative union which seeks
to divide the unity which already
prevails in our nation. They should
join the organizations who strive and
work for peace, nationhood and fra-
ternity.

Forward with progresnve people's
organizations.

ALLOW me to air my views on behalf
of many. I fee! disappointed when IJ
| see follow former combatants who
are wandering around the streets of
Namibia’s cities and towns.

Being a formercombatant myself,
I feel that we are all neglected and
forgotten by the Government that we
have fought for. We had no time to
eam a living in the past years, simply
because we were engaged in the armed
struggle for the liberation of Na-
muibia. The struggle has been long
and bitter, many of our brothers and
sisters have sacrificed their precious
lives for the liberation of our mother-
land, others are crippled for life.

Now that the struggle for political
independence is won, why is it still
continuing in cases like ours? We
suffered during the years of armed
struggle in the bush, but we still
continue to suffer, even after inde-
pendence, even worse than was the
case inthe bush. We have no jobs and
if one manages to get work, then
there is no roof over his or her head.

Our qualifications, which some of
us obtained abroad, are disregarded
by employers, yet most of us have
leamed at institutions in independent
countries where there 1s no segrega-
tion or racial discrimination.

In Namibia we are asked to pro-
vide the employers with Bantu Edu-
cation certificates which in my view
18 nonsense.

It is really disappointing to learn
that most of the civil servanis in our
Government offices are former
Koevoet members who were doliber-
ately put in certain positions by the

colonial regime. Many of these people .

do not possess a Standard 10 or col-
lege certificate like many of us do.
These people were merely employod
because of the colour of their skin
and they dominate in every workplace.

Letter

We have no chance anywhere. The
Government should seriously look
into our problem and do something
about it. We read in newspapers daily
that the enemy of peace, Unita, and
their collaborators are trying to cre-
ate conditions conducive for another
war in our country. Yet the Govermn-
meant does not want to allow all those
who are able-bodied former Plan
combatants to join the national army.
Are we ignoring the realities?

The enemy want destabilization
and poverty to take root here as has
occurred in Angola and Mozambique.
It is time to think twice and make
sure that the heroes and heroines who
fought for the liberation of this coun-
try should be at least fully integrated
into the police and national army in
order to defend the gains of the revo-
lution against enemy encroachment.

We want to see the changes for
peace and independence of our people
maintained by the loyal men and
women we now see wandering around
without jobs. Reconciliauon must
make things balance.

The Government! must see to it that
these brave men and women are
assisted by the state, oven if it means
creating a demobilization fund 20
that they can make ends meet.

Law of the knife

I WISH toexpress my feelings about
the violation of human nghts in
Namibia. At this pount I would like to
urge my fellow Namibians to respect
life more than money or property.
Many people have lost their lives
since independence. Mainly because
some people do not want to respect
the laws and constitution of the
Republic of Namibia which provides
for-the protection of life, and other
human rights.

The use of knives to kill others is the
order of the day in Namibia, espe-
cially among young people. In order
to reduce or eradicate the problem
altogether, 1 appeal to the govern-
mem to introduce laws to prohibit
the carrying of knives in public places.
The knife is as dangerous as the gun,
and there must be punishment to
ensure that knife-users are deterred.
What we have to bear in mind is that
the killing of innocent people is a
violation of human righté in terms of
our laws,

Note that the constitution says that
all human beings are bom free and
equal in dignity and rights, without
distinction of any kind, such as race,
colour, sex, language, religion,

IS that really the question?

At one time I believed very strongly
that whoever is responsible for the
Timea of Namibia editorially, has
somne sort of death-wish. I could just
act believe thet axrybody with a sane
sind could write or allow such mb-
bish to be wriftes as appears in the

which I still do, that that person went

the democratic government will tol-

erate being belittied and called all
so 8s of names, 1s the question in the
mands of so many Namubians, and let
me assure the Times and DTA that
they are many.

I think now that the Times is cer-
tain that there 1s no action that will be
taken: there are even times when it
revertstonaked racism in its descrip-
ton of ‘black’ African countries, while
reference to South Africa creates the
impression of a docile dog creeping
with ifs tail betwoen its logs in front
of its master. Lest 1 deviate, let me
return to the issue 1 am writing about.

The belief that whatever deliber-
ately negative remarks or unfounded

[

accusations are made against the
govemment will force it to collapse,
borders on insanity. Boasting about
bnnging down the govemment singie-
handedly with such reports shock the
imagination of any human being. Itis
with this in mind that I read of the
‘Evidence on Namibian coup’ in the
October 5 edition of the Times.
The said newspaper reports exten-
sively on evidence given by Josef
Kleynhans, who told the court that
some people tned to recruit him fora
‘coup’ against the govemment. The
concept that itis only armiescapable
of staging coups, as repeatedly said
by the Times, is s0 ridiculous, but
their attempt to create the impression

that the arms theft was only a minor
‘adventure’, is, I fee] an attempt to
downplay the seriousness of the crime.
The thieves will finally, in the cyes
of the Times, be nothing more than
‘youths in search of adventure’.

I] hate to think what would have
happened if such a theft took place in
the previous dispensation and if the
‘adventurers’ were black and not white.

This comes after weeks of specu-
lation in tho same newspaper as to
whether there was really a coup plot
in Namibia or not. It is interesting, to
say the least, that this newspaper
should now have a headline report on
the coup. One wonders about this
paper's sense of journalistic ethics,
for in the past couple of weeks it
decried the coup story which was
broken by The Namibian as a ‘fig-
ment’ of that paper's imagination.

Now the Times of Namibia will
probably become the champion against
the coup. It seems to be trendy for the
Times to, on the one hand, deny the
existence of a coup and on the other
to be the first to report on evidence
given about it.

Whether one calls it an intended
coup or not, is purely academic. In

fact, the academio masturbation about -
coup or no coup does not impress the
majority ofNamiblans. Lat us at
tho facts: numerous arms .were sid
len, surely not to play ‘cowboys apd
crooks’, but to cause irreparable harm.

Now tho opposition papers can
call it what they want, can even give

disrupt our hardwon independance
and democracy.

""Unfair to aliens’ of October 2, by
‘Fed-up Alien’. It is clear from the
detter that the anonymous writer suf-
fers from racism. My concem here,
however, is to put the matter right.

First and foremost, I hope the writer
is aware that every country has a law
relating to ‘aliens’, ‘foreigners’ and
‘illegal immigrants’ or whatever one
prefers tocall them. Such laws serve
a number of purposes. First, they
protect the security of the country.
Second, to keep a record of aliens in
the event of a population census.
Thirdly, to enable law enforcement
machinery to effectively control border
traffic.

In response to your letter, it is my
opinion that many foreigners who
came to Namibia in the past five
years did not do so because they
loved Namibia. Neither did people
from South Africa come here be-
cause they did not agree what was
happening there. After all, at that
time the same things were happening
in both countries.

If they thought what was happen-
ing in South Africa was wrong, they
should have stayed and applied their
“skills and experience’ to exert pres-
sare for change. However, these
‘skilled’ people preferred to come
and tale of the brou
shout by the ‘orkilled labour"" of
Namibia.

The government must adhere to
the constitution, which is the su-
prom law of the land. It applies to

' @veryone, whether govemment

white, Asian, or African.
‘The govenument cannot give citi-

foreigners arrived here for different
reasons. Many of them were not
genuine. Is it not surprising to you
that most people involved in dia-
mond smuggling, rhino and ivory are
foreigners?

You claim that ‘aliens’ and ‘South
Africans’ are the only people with
skills. Many South Africans here came
because they could not be absorbed
in the South African economy. They
did not all come here with skills and
experience - the colonial policy was
to provide job opportunit#s here for
those people at the expense of the
Namibians. Namibia has been used
as a laboratory for upgrading and
training South African unskilled
labour.

The people who yame back from
exile are Namubiaiccitizens. They
were bor here and their parents and
relatives are here.

They were fighting for the inde-
pendence of this country and are
fully qualified as citizens.

We do not see many signs of the

IT am saying this because previous

The very first thing that struck him
was the quite obvious attitude of
pupils and teachers of the local white
schools. They were seated separately
from the pupils of the so-called black
schools.

The President immediately called
upon the pupils and the teachers of
the white schools tocome closer, and
mix with pupils of the other schools.
This call was welcomed with great
applause by the people present.

This practical gesture demonstrated
our President's seriousness with the
policy of reconciliation. He again
referred to the children as the future
leaders of Namibia. It is the pupils of
the pre-primary to secondary level
who must learn to live and play with
one another.

The speech by the President per-
sonally gave me hope for the future
and the efforts of our young govern-
ment. The optimistic manner in which
he facee his and our many challenges,
was reassuring, and we must pray for

lasting peace and stability in our
beautiful country.

Our President also proved that he
remains a man of the people, despite
his high position. It gave me great
Joy to see how humble and down: to-
earth he is.

At the end of his address, the Mayor
tried to restore order as the school-
children became so excited. Presi-
dent Nujoma gare them the rest of
the day off.

As] left the stadium I felt spintu-
ally satisfied. As I saw our lads started
to play soccer on the grass, I remem-
bered that 1t was also the 50th birth-
day of Pele, the world’s greatest soccer

- player.

Who knows, maybe one of them
will one day be Namibia's Pele, with
the opportunities and leadership that
are offered by our great President,
Sam Nujoma.

f Misch 21 means ..

THERE are only « few days
left before we celcbrate the
first anniversary of our hard-
won independence. It was 12
moaths ago when the popular
ruling party. Swapo, the then
Hberation movement which
gallantly fought and defeated
the then notorious forces of
occupation at the battlefront as
well as the ballot box, adopted
the policy of national recon-
ciliation, the policy of forgive-
ness and focus on the future.

First of all, let ue examine
the significance of March 21.
The date is and will remain an
illuminating day in the Na.
mibian calendar. Illuminating
in the sense that itis the day on
which the yoke of colomalism.
which was imposed on us, was
buried for ever.

It was the day on which
dignitaries from all over the
world joined the brave sons
and daughters of this country
to witness the burial of coloni-
alism by replacing the South
Afncan flag with that of the
new Republic of Namibia.

It was a wonderful and
moving occasion, which pres-
ent and future generations will
never forget. It was a day on
which the nationalist fighters
stood hand in hand and said
‘look, our sacrifices have not
been in vain’.

As the freedom fightars were
rejoicing, those who fought
against the emergence of
democracy stood with their
hands on their heads.

Why was it necessary to adopt
the policy of national recon-
ciliatian? The movement's aims
and objectives were to liberate
this coumtry from the then forces
of colonial oppression and
establish a government founded
upon the will and participation
of the Namibian people.
uns achioved that, the

-——

colonial regime with the view
of the achievement
of democracy. With this in mind,
Swapo opted for a policy of
national reconciliation which
is humane and suitable for
Namibians.

The most striking aspect of
the policy is that it promotes
the values of equality and human
dignity. It intends to unite the
Namubian people irrespective
of colour, race, nationality or
ongin. This policy deserves
our respect.

Many have complained about

» the negative aspects of national

reconciliation but Little has been
heard about its ments

The success of the policy
depends on the performances
of those implementing it. The
ments of this policy are more
than its dements. This policy
is, in my view, meant to pro-
vide a breathing space for those
harbounng illusions about the
past colomal system to adjust
themselves to a new era of
national independence, peace,
stability and the humane ap-
proach.

As we rejoiced on March 21
last year, we were equally
womied about what we had
inhented from the then noton-
ous colonial regime in terms
of debt, unemployment and
pobtical instability (the latter
with regard to tendencies of
tnbalism and racial discnnu-
nation based on colour)

The probleniis, how are we
going lo pay the socalled debt
without economic prospenty,
and how are we going to com-
bat the already deteriorating
unemployment situation with-
out economic growth?

The government's efforts to
combat the unemployment
situation will be meaningless
unless accompanied dy the will
and voluntary participation of
the ‘haves’ of our society.

We expected the electranic
and print mediatoplay a major
role in shaping the destiny of
our people. But at the moment,
its efforts aro feeble because
we aro divided. We have just

emerged from s unique oolo-
nial system, a system in which

our people were taught to behave
in a tribalistic manner. This
evil sysiom has contaminated
the minds of some members of
our society, making it difficult
for them to adjust to the new
era of independence. The media
should be offering guidance to
our people to create for them
opportunities to rebuild their
self-respect, restore their faith
and rediscover for themselves
their human dignity. Regional
radio stations should be utl-
ised for the bene fil of people in
those regions.

Oue of the Government's
nian pnonties 1s education. It
1s the finest foundation of all
for the nation-building proc-
ess. Its also the comerstone
upon which 1a rest our surest
hopes to build our young Re-
public

As we approach the first
anniversary of independence,
we necd tn be devoted to the
cause of national building
through the process of national
reconciliation.

Fauure to implement this
posinvely will effect the con-
cept of democracy in this coun-
try.

We cannot achieve any of
these objectives unless we are
hardworking, disciplined, law-
abiding and unplement the
policy of national reconcili-
ation un 2 positive light.

Yet the police accuse people
who live among bad elements,
for killing them in defending
an elderly man. You should
not blame people whose aims
are to do away with cnminals
in this cuyatry. Rather take
steps again the cnminals

The houses where these bad
elements are staying are well
known to everybody, the po-
lice included. The “mbotsotso”
should not be allowed to lake
the law into their own hands
and disturb peace and stability
in Uus country. Moreover, we
are aware of those who col-
laborate with the “mbotsotso”’.

The reason why Katutura
residents decided not to fold
their arms and watch their
beloved fellow citizens being
killed by “mbotsotsos” is
because if they are brought
before justice they will proba-
bly be granted bail or acquitted

These revelations have once

Peace and independence has
cost the lives of many Namubi-

It is my belief that 1n inter-

must beset up to investigate
the extent of SA involvement
in those elections.

As we find ourselves envel-
oped in this vibrant situation,

be careful that we do not create
a situation where privilege by
virtue of colour is replaced by
privilege by virtue of wealth
and whereby only the ‘haves’

are forced to accept poverty as

We who are govemed com-

a new person, with a new mind,
a new heart and a new spint. I
also believe that the hope for

us, the people, black and white,
who have come through the

We need new minds, new hearts

Wecommend your Govein-

the Ministry of Education and

know that the allocated funds
to this Ministry will not solve
all the educational problemsio

EO ane eee orn eon ime ee

vering, they illegally allocated
the barest patches of land to
our people, taking over the best
farmland, today known as
commercial farming land.

IT know very well what hap-
pened in the south, central and
northem regions to my people.
They have relocated the Na-
masin socalled Namaland, the
Damaras were thrown away in
the barren western region, the
Hereros to the barren east and
north-east. Let it be known to
those who don't know or pre.
tend not to know that no amouni
of moncy or political manoeu-
vVering will stop the quest for
the regaining of our traditional
pastures.

We did not forget the past
We shall never do so. We want
our land back. They never
bought it from us. They anier-
change money toour debit and
continued misery and poverty.
Weare not asking fer a fai
distribuiron of bind, We want

tall back.

Why, Ms Editor, do you think
thatthe majonty of Numag and
Damaras are the poorest to-
day? Simply because they are
the moat destitute people sinc}
they suffered most mm terms <5
land robbery and murder. Why
do you think the land in the
socalled Hereroland is so
trampled? Simpty because their
land waa stolen. Why do you
think northern Namibia is fast
becoming a desert? Simply
because their land including

Etosha and Trumeb area was

robbed?

Editor, if at all the Land
Conference wishes to achieve
peace, it has to address the
cardinal issues. There is no
way wo are going to be talked
into improving current ‘home-
lands’. It is actually wrong to
talk of ‘homelands’, since the
whole of Namibia is OUR
homeland.

Reconciliation implies
wrongdoing. Wrongdoing
implies correcting the wrongs.
We cannot put the cart in frec:
of the donkey. We have to start
at the beginning of the colonisa-
tion and end with the handing
over of Namibia to its rightful
owners. We are poor because
of the annihilation of land. How
can whoever expect us to raise
money where to raise money
with which to buy our land
back from whom?

Let us not be lured by the
forked tongues of land sharks.
They have no interest in Na-
mibia. Now is the time that
Namibia will be truly inde-
pendent, not only on paper but
in real land ownership tens.

To those who are to attend

history and be solely guided
by it. We are all products of
our sad history. Woe are once

I AM writing to advise the
Ministry of Defence not to
misuse this time of peace.

Too much of a good thing is
monotonous. Soldiers in bases
around the country have no
work to do, except continuous
manocuvres and this brings
boredom.

On many occasions soldiers
are told to attend classes but
due to boredom they go absent
without leave.

My suggestion is that the
Ministry should take advan-
tage of this, and utilise the
soldiers in bases inthese times
of peace.

It would be better if the
Ministry could provide build-
ers to show soldiers how to
construct their own barracks
and provide them with bull-
dozers and tractors to lake part
in agneultural projects.

It we keep our soldiera busy
with productive tusks as wel!
as Constructive ones, this will
give us a good reputation with
the nation.

Soldiers need to be taught
skills so that they could join
workers’ brigades with better
qualifications whenever they

ALLOW me to congratulate
the Cabinet of the Namibian
Government for its decision to
withdraw the licence of thee
Hotel Onduri in Outjo. This
was a much needed sign to all
racists that the status quo can-
not be allowed to continue.

The policy of national rec-
Onciliation has been abused time
and again by those who cannot
accept change and in fact are
still opposed to Namibia's
independence. Incidents of
racism frequently occur, espe-
cially in outlying areas, and in
my opinion the government has

_ been far too lenient in its ac-
tions thus far.

This encouraged the reac-
tionary forces to continue
‘business as usual’; workers
are still victimised tad exploited
while the ‘white’ privileges
remain untouched.

Social justice 1s a prerequi-
site for peace and democracy
and hopefully the Outjo deci-
sion will send a clear signal
that racism cannot be allowed
to continue. All incidents of |

racism should be dealt with in

Now we kre women in peace.
| Let ya have ourchance to fulfil
our ‘nepirations to help our

‘cotintry to emerge from the
‘darkness’ of , inequal-
ity and grinding poverty. The
dreams of a Nanubia
will be doomed in the absence
of women's participation. On
top of that, the idea that all
people, the youth, the women
and the elderly should be in-
volved in the development
process isan extremely impor-
{amt one, particularly af this
time when Namibia needs to
marshall all its available re-
sources for development. Ef-
fective utilisation of human
resources at all levels and all
dimensions, is key to the pro-
motion of real development in
Namibia.

The time has come that a
change of attitude must take
place. Women have now for
some time realised that we have
the potential (social, economic
and political) and wisdom to
shape the future of this coun-
try. We therefore nghtfully

demand the opportunity to have |

this vajuable potential fully

tapped fur the development of |

Namibia. Machinery to enable
women of Namubia to fully
participate in the development
of our motherland must be put
in place.

Women’s participation will
change society and liberate
women. Women's struggic
must not be seen in one dimen-
gion, as simply a struggic against
men. See the many aspects of
the structural dimension (so-
cial, political, cultural and
economic).

Struggle means awareness.
Struggle means organisation
and unity. Struggle means
courage, struggle means faith
and hope. We must begin to
build these up in our small
circles and link up with one
another. Nobody can help in
this process more than women
ourselves, Let us mobilise and
organise ourselves for cystem-
atic involvement in change. Let
‘us support ourse} ves in organi-

Your observation that our
decision to disaffiliate from
Swapo was shortsighted,
immature and irresponsible, is
a dogmatc approach that 1s
accompanied by a security
phobia and a serous lack of
analysis on the role of mass
Organisations in 2 post-colo-
mal ¢ra. You seem not to be a
democrat at all.

Nanso is opting for a disci-
plined working alliance with
parues who share common
programmes, objectives and
campaigns. Nanso cannot be
apolitical in a political eavi-
ronment.

Hence the need for stnilang a
balance between the need for
strengthemng the organisation's
independent base on the one
hand, and the role Nanso will
have to play wn our country’s
restructunng of the economy
and the formulatonof policies
on the other hand. Our impact
on the situation will depend on
our representation, unity and
strength on the ground.

Our most immediate task is
to mobilise and unite our stu-
denis. Majonty of our students

Chief’s tribalism

I WOULD like to refer to the
socalled revelations by Chief
Mamili published in The
Namibian entitled ‘The Mafwe
state their case’ on August 31.

If this revelation comes from
the Chief himself then all peace
and freedom-loving Namibi.
ans should without hesitation
declare him the 1991 cham-
pion of tnbalism - for it ap-
pears he is unable to think
beyond the tnbe.

The point I would like to
make to Chief Mamuli and a
small section of the Mafwe
surrounding him is that the
cheapest colonisation method
used to colonise Namibia was
through the existence of tnbes
- the championing of one tnbe
at the expense of others so asto
smoothly pave the way for the
bantustanisaton of Namibia.

It is disappointing to learn
that Chief Mamili claims Ka-
tima Mulilo is a Mafwe area.
Capnvi knew no boundanes
even in the time of the colon:-
alists.

Why should we talk of tribal
divisions and tnbal bounda-
nies at this time? What are we
going to benefit from tribal
conflicts apart from rolling back
the progressive idea of national
reconciliation the ruling party
is keen to implement in order
to mould a healthy and pros-
perous nation?

I am challenging Chief

-Mamili to tell the Namibian
nation today the book of his-
. tory he and his associates read
® indicates Caprivi knew

in Namibia against
the will of the inhabitants. If
the socalled revelation came
from Chief Mamili directly,
then he should apologise to the
Namibian nation for the in-
conveniences provoked by the
violent demonstration and the
subsequent damage to peace
and nation-building.

The prefabricated allegation
that the recently appointed
people in the Ministry of Edu-
cation are unqualified, is a case
of character assassination and
if | were them, | would take
you to court.

If Chief Mamuli ts a real
chief as he claims, he should
stop listening to Mishake
Muyongo who wants to ac-
complish his political ambi-
uions of divide and rule.

In this patriotic process of
moulding anation, the concept
of championing tribalism should
be looked at as a political lia-
bility that 1s detrimental to
nation-building. Caprivi as an
integral part of Namibia be-
longsto all Namibiansand still

Money for tribes

1 AM very unhappy about the

to tnbalism in Caprivi. The
Govemment of the day is no:

it to defend tribalism. On the
other hand, the Mafwe are left
victims of the tribal acts of the
Basubia, while the government
dangles its legs on the fence of
prospenty.

Chief Moraliswam should be
called to order by the Govern-
ment. And those who were
involved in the unconstitutional
inauguration of the chief as
Paramount Chief be disciplined
accordingly. The Basubia have
gone too far with their abuse of
democracy and now 1s the time
they should be given a lecture
to bang them tu their senses.

Much has been said about
the Basubia and the Mafwe arc
fed up with them. If the Gov-
emment fails to discipline them,
the Mafwe are bound to doit

The military and police were

_ despatched to Capnvi in the
name of mataining peace.
Recently the Basubia cheated
the government to say that
people are being lalled in the
Capnvi and that there were
many in the moruary, many
injured and many admutted to
hospital. Forces were des-
patched but found the claims
unfounded. What a waste of

ubia should know tha: this
money is supposed to be used
for capital projects to the ad-
vantage of Namibians and not
just one tmba: group. i call
upon taxpayers to condemn the
abuse of money un this man-
ner.

[In the history of Namibia no
chiefhas ever been made para-
mount over one tnbe let alone
another chief's temtory. Moral-
iswani 1s geographically not
really a chief because he lives
under the junsdiction of an-
other chief, and his advisors,
like Likando and Mwazi, should
make him aware of this.

The same chief should re-

punish the youth to impress
the Boers (Mayumbelo, Juluka
and Sampati are alive and can
bear this out); and the same
Basubia told the Boers how
pro-Swapo the Mafwe were in

taking place with the group

Gurirab replies

I THOUGHT | should waite a
brief explanatory notelin con-
nection with Mr Andrew Per-
nn's article on page 5 in The
Namibian of November 15
1991. 1 am requesting you to
see to it that this letter is pub-
lished in your newspaper.

Mr Perrin apparently did not
have the appreciation of the
mix of the audience I was
addressing at the Annual South-
em African Universities So-
cial Sciences Conference and
therefore misrepresented some
of what I had to Say, particu-
larly about the present state of
democracy in Namibia and a
possible onslaught on it, from
either the far nght or from
Swapo's traditional support-
ers.

My point about democracy,
which was addressed toa sec-
tion of the audience, had to do
with a linkage that certain major
Westem countries are now
insisting on, such as muln-party
democracy, human nghts and
market economy as anew type
of conditionality for giving
development aid. Elsewhere and
in our country, I have been
saying that all these require-
ments are fully in place and
functioning in Namibia, yet the
consistency and levels of aid
to our country leave much to
be desired. So much on this
point.

Mr Andrew Perrin, in his
article entitled ‘University
Conference Wraps Up’, reports
that I “acknowledged grow-
ing public discontent with the _

What I said in my speech,
which I had stated on many
occasions before, is that if
Namibian democracy 1s not
assisted with sustained and
substantial economic and fi-
nancial aid, there is a likel1-
hood that Swapo's traditional]
constituencies such as the un-
ions, youth and ex-combatants
will become disenchanted with
the Government. The gap in
social dispanties rather than
narrowing would continue
widening. In a nutshell, while
our democracy is functioning
and growing, it still remains a
fragile expenment.

Democracy and development
go hand-in-hand, but the nec-
essary pre-condition a country
must have is a situation of peace
and stability. This we have in
Namibia, and the Govemmment
is determined to carry on with
development efforts on this
basis.

On Walvis Bay

An open letter to
UN Secretary General
Dr Boutros Boutros Gali

IN VIEW of Namibia's sec-
ond anniversary of independ-
ence, I would like to express
my deservedly deep concer
about parts of our country still
under foreign domination.
Whiting straight to you proba-
bly reveals my ignorance re-
garding the ‘correct method’
of communicating with you.
However, deliberate depriva-
tion and annihilation during
the tragic colonial era would
justify my shortcomings. No
wonder, Namibia’s current
more than 50 per cent illiter-
acy rate. 7
Nowhere in the world, at
of Nations and subsequently
the United Nations’ existence,
were more resolutions passed,
defied, overlooked and/or for-
gotten than in the world body’s
former ‘baby’ for which it had
direct responsibility.
The long colonial years di-
lapidated both Namibia’s un-
renewable natural and human

still paying reparations to each
other after the two world wars.
Regardless of her plunder at
the expense of growth, pro-
duction, literacy and self-suf-
ficiency, Namibia has her sec-
ond anniversary of sovereignty
in debt and heavily dependent
upon imports.

Worse still, more than 90
per cent of her imported com-
modities are handled in Walvis
Bay, her only deepwater port.
Unfortunately, to our detriment,
Walvis Bay is apparently still
considered as part of South
Africa. Twelve, if not more of
Namibia’s offshore islands are
also still under South African
control, thus effectively reduc-
ing the area covered by the
country’s offshore rights by
about one-fifth.

If part of the world body’s
responsibilities is to safeguard
peace, security, self-determi-
nation of member states: and
observation of good faith and
overwhelming justice towards

all nations, then Namibia de-
serves its long-violated rights
and national integrity honoured.
I therefore, on behalf of the
Namibian people, request your
organistion to ensure that jus-
tice prevails and that Walvis
Bay and the offshore islands
are retumed to the authentic
control of the indigenous popu-
lation - the Namibian people. I
should be grateful to see the
new world order incorporating
all parts of this fragile world.

would like to respond to Dr
Petrus J Krige’s letter which
appeared in The Namibian on
April 3.

First I would like to make it
clear that the policy of na-
tional reconciliation was unani-
mously declared asa national
policy and not only the Presi-

tions have to make sure that
the policy goes deep into the
roots of this country and is
clearly understood by all citi-
zens. This is the task of every
Namibian. For that matter, Dr
Knige is not only against the
prevailing atmosphere in this
country, but he is also against
its independence, as such he is
an enemy of peace and justice.

There is no one in this coun-
try who would support his line,
except perhaps a few friends
who are suffering from the same
disease.

When we talk about recon-
ciliation, we mean business,
and we do not judge people by
colour, sex, political affiliation,

ideological differences or be-
liefs.

Tt is untrue to say that the

Government of Namibia does
not allow judges and sport
participants from South Af-
rica while it allows imports
from the same country. J think
you are joking, and are obvi-
ously not a Namibian. If you
are, then you don’t need to get
a job, but re-orientation and
attend lectures to familiarise
yourself with what is happen”
- ing in Namibia. You must be
the first ignorant intellectual
in Namibia.

Regarding culture, the Gov-
ernment of Namibia is ademo-
cratic one, and I can assure you
that it doesn’t limit rights and

freedoms as you maintain. .

Everyone has the nght to en-
joy his or her cultural heritage
provided that this is in keeping
with article 19 of the
Constitution of Namibia.

I think that his theory is
misleading, if not inciting hatred
among Namibians. Since you
are a doctor in musicology,
maybe you need a medical
doctor to cure you of the dis-
ease called a superiority com-
plex and your racism. It is a
pity we still have people in this
country who are anti-progress

dent or Government institu- .

and anti-nation building.

Are you also saying that
Namibians are unable to do
administrative work? And are
you saying that Namubians
should not be appointed to high
positions? I believe that all
Namibians, irrespective of
colour, should have equal
opportunities and be able to
run state machinery. Don’t
underestimate the abilities of
Namibian people, sir. It is not
only foreigners who can do
these jobs.

Neither should you insult our
national anthem. ‘Freedom
fight” has no undesirable or
negative connotations. It is only
your ignorant, anti-democratic
and racist sentiments. Who are
the Namibians who live inside
the country who don't share
the same sentiment regarding
this? You are an autocrat and
cannot talk on behalf of demo-
crats. Who gave you the man-
date to do so?

J don’t think you can pre-
tend not to know why Swapo
opted for the armed struggle.
There is hardly anyone, even
non-citizens of this country,
who do not know, this.

‘You are not only against —

Swapo as the ruling y party, but

also against the Namibian .

people. You do not even honour
people who sacnificed their lives
for the cause of this country
and now you want to be given
a job, probably as a director,
because you think you are the
best and only musicologist in
this country.

I feel sorry for you sir. Be-

sides musicology, you appear
to be totally empty politically.
National reconciliation is our
policy and if you don’t like it
you should go to a place where
there is no peace and justice,
since you want the policy tobe
reversed. Think twice, sir, and
learn from your mistakes.

ONCE upon a time there was

were song. For auuty years
thes fought against colonial
rule under BAPPA, the Ba-
sibian Peoples Party. After a
long and paurful struggle,
Basibia finally won its inde-
pendence. Now the Basibian
people were free to shape their
own nation.

“Now we can be just like
other nations in Africa”, sad
some of the people. “Oh no”,
said others, “we must learn
from our brothers and sisters.
We will follow their successes
and avoid their mistakes”

Basibia adopted a
constitution that was admired
all over the world because it
made Basibia a tue democ-
Tacy.

BAPPA swept to victory in
Basibia’s first election as an
independent nation because
it promused to live up to is
name as a people's party. Its
election posters said ‘United
We Stand, Divided We Fall’
and ‘Build a New Basibia tor
all Bas:bians’.

The ieader of BAPPA be-
came the first President of
Basibia He ioved the people
of Basia and was much loved
by them.

“We are all Basibians to-
gether’, he said. “Every man,
woman and child in this na-
tion is my family, and I will
not rest while any of my people
are suffering”.

“That is fine”, said some of
the members of BAPPA, “but
now we must talk about our
salaries. To keep the peace.
we have promised all the gov-
eminent employees who were
hired before independence that
their salaries will not be re-
duced. So we must pay our-
selves at least as much as
they are getting, or perhaps
even more”

“No”, said the President
“those people were robbing
our country. Why should we
follow in their footsteps? Be-
cause we work for the gov-
emument, we are given houses
to live in while many of our
people are homeless. The state
even gives us pensions and
medical aid. We will pay
ourselves modest suanes. And
Thave State House to live mn
and a government car to travel
in - I will be well taken care
of. My salary must be the
lowest of all”.

“But, Comrade President’,
the others cried, “you cin't
do that. You are the father of
the nation. Surely your salary
must be the highest. No leader
of any other country would
do such a thing”.

‘And the President replied
“You say that | am the father
of our nation - what father
would eat while his children
go hungry? A true leader does
not separate himself from his
people. Let Basibia be differ-
ent. Letus set an example for

. re

the world!”

The neat des some of the
President's advisors came to
talk to him adout Cars for the
government. “Of course,
Benz's’. they sad “The Ba-
sibian people would lke to
see us urcars that wili swt out
status as leaders”.

“No”, said the President, “T
do not think so. We willnecd
transport, but we must save
as much money as possible
for developing our nation. No
one working in this govem-
mentis going to drive a fancy
car”

“But Comrade President”,
they said, “all the highest
government officials before
independence drove expen-
sive cars. And so do Heads of
State all over the world!”

“Yes”, said the President
“but we will be different. We
will set an example. A truce
leader does not separate
himself from the people. You
must remember that most of
the people of Basibia cannot
afford a car at all. Find us
some uexpensive cars that
will get us where we need lo
go""

“Now, Commie President”.
said the advisors, “we need to
build a new place for Parha-
ment to meet""

“But why?”, said the Presi-
dent, ‘Is there no place where
we can gather to do our work?""

“Yes”, they said, “but itis
old and dingy and we will be
crowded there. We want a
fancy room with anew carpet
and leather chairs”.

“No”, said the President, ‘T
will not spend any money on
govermunent buildings until
every single person in our
nation has a home to l.ve in
Until thatday, we must get by
with what we have”

The next day tne President's
advisors were back again.
“Comrade President”. they
said, “we will have to make
many trips to other counmes.
We must share ideas and
discuss issues and make agree-
ments with the people of other
nations”.

“This is true”. said the Presi-
dent, “we must do some Tav-
elling. But we must always
think of savug money. None
of my ministers will fly first
class, and we will always stay
in the cheapest hotels”.

“But Comrade President,
they said, a government min-
ister must travel in style. You
would not want your Mmunis-
ters to be crowded and un-
comfortable”

And the President said “how
can you talk about being
crowded and uncomfortable
when have seen some of our
people living in the single
quarters, 10 and 20 people
sleeping in one tny room,
every night of their lives?”

“But what about you, com-
rade President?”, they said,
“you must have your own
plane forefficiency and s¢cu-

rity”.
“Very well, bul we must
find the’smallest, cheapest,

simplest plane that can take
me where [ need to go. A true

leader does not separate
himpelf from the people. We
are going to setanexample to
the world”.

It was not long before a
delegation came from Parlia-
ment to visit the President.
“Comrade President’, they
said, “this cannot continue.
We are Basibia’s leaders. We
fought for independence and
now we deserve our reward”.

“Yes”, said the President.
“but we did not fight alone
Would any of us be here in
goverment today if we had
not had the support of our
people? All Basbians deserve
the reward of a new Basibia
where all can prosper”.

“But, comrade President”,
they said, “no other country
in the warld operates this way.
We will be the laughing stock
of Afnca”.

“No”, sad the President, “7
think you are going to be sur-
prised”.

And it was not long before
anew spint came to Basibid -
aspiritof giving and sharing.
Government muinistnes held
compeutons to see which ones
could save the most money
Somme of the civil servants who
had been hired before inde-
pendence were so embarrassed
about their high salanes that
they asked for salary culs.
Even private citizens sold ther
fancy cars because it was so
unfashionable to be seen in
them.

And the government spent
money on health care and
education and Literacy train-
ing and development projects
and social secunty payments
for the old and unemployed.
It was not long before the
standard of living of every
single person in Basibia had
nsen. No one was hungry.
Children were healthier.
Everyone in Basibia had a
home, and almost everyone
could read. Ard the govern-
menthad been so careful with
its money tha: Basibia was
not dependent on foreign aid.
Basibia was truly free.

The President was respected
and admired more than any
other leader in any county in
the history of the world All
over Basibia people said “A
true leader does not separate
himself from the people”. They
voted for BAPPA again and
again, and Basibia remained
peaceful and prosperous.

And soon Basibia was fa-
mous. No other nation had
ever dared 10 be so different.
Visitors came streaming in
from ail over the world 10 see
this remarkable place. New
investors were attracted 10
Basibia because tl was SO
unique. People in every land
recognised the wisdom of the
President of Basibia and he
was awarded many honours
(which he always accepted in
the name of al! Basibians).

Basibians had once said
“We must be like all other
counties”. Now people in

othercountries said “we want
to be like Basibia”

And thatis how one small
nation began to change the
world

ANON

The jet outcry

IT has never been part of my
culture to engage myself in
public debates which are being
over-emphasised for polincal
gain.

In the face of the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an R80 mil-
hon jet for the Government
and officials of the Republic
of Namubia, I was faced with
several questions which I could
not help to answer.

I fully concur with the fact
thatour county faces numer-
ous problems, some short tem
and others long term. Take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane

Now the question is whether
it ig tue that those ‘Muyon-
gos’ who presuppose that the
R8O million could have been
better spent uf used for tehet
programmes are more sensi-
tive to the realities in Na-
mibia? If so, how far back
have they (Muyongos) been
so critical about the way in
which taxpayers’ money has
been spent for the purchase
of things such as Casspirs and
Mirages by their regime, the
former interim government?

Or, docs Muyongo wantus
to believe that the money mus-
used on the purchase of war
material at the ume of their
rule was ‘ess than R80 mil-
lion? And was it not taxpay-
ers’ money?

This country has inhented
a debt which i has to repay
due to the misuse of funds
and the cnminal war which
was impesed on our people.
Again, does Muyongo want
us to accept that the drought
and other social evils in our
country today are new hap-
penings? T assume not.

Unemployment. hunger, [0
mention but a few, are the
legacy of the past history ot
the country. Even at the tume
of successive colonial regimes.
the problems were there.

As these problems did not
prevent them (the Muyongos)
from purchasing wanton war
matenals which ran to bil-
ons of Rands which this
country is left to repay today,
likewise, should these pre-
vent the legitimate govern:
ment from purchasing a plane
which will enable the Presi-
dent and other Government
officials to maintain contacts
with the outside world for the
benefit of the people of this
country?

Even if the plane were not
purchased, could there be

t is Surprising that

in the Communal areas. That

tons could have Started there

to solve the national issue of

Itis also surprising that the
Government, whenever it talks
of the legal or rightful acqui-
sition of land, only concen-
trates on communal land. Let
it be stated here categorically
Clearly that we the Namibian
people, and especially those
of us who laboriously fought
to return back our stolen land,
did so for the whole of Na-
mibia including the socalled
commercial farmland.

Lasting peace and stability

in this country could only come
if equitable distribution of land
is done now and not later. The
question of senior officials
acquiring land only demon-
Strates to us that people are
hungry for land. Lf senior of-
ficials have the means of us-
ing their official positions to
acquire the land, the mass of
our people who on numerous
occasions have demonstrated
publicly to have the land ques-
tion settled, may one day take
up arms to revoke the present
Status quo as far as land own-
ership is concerned.

It is hurtful to note that the
land price is artificially made
to be exhorbitantly high to
benefit those who forcefully
took control of our people
and ownership of our land.
Once cannot accept that in
Windhoek it is practically im-
possible to buy a piece of
land to build a dwelling.

So, Mr Prime Minister, we
the silent majority, who fought
for the liberation of this coun-
try and suffered imprisonment
and detention for the libera-
tion of this country, who dem-
onstrated fearlessly in the
streets of Windhoek, Katu-
tura, mines, schools, did so to
ensure that Namibia is free.
We who voted the Swapo gov-
emment to power want our
land NOW. We expect you
urgently to implement the Land
Conference recommenda-
tions. The more delays to the
solution of this probicin. the
‘more our path::. - will run

If this suggestion is not
workable, may I ask the Gov-
¢mment to put the question to
the electorate during regional
elections which are due be-

fore the end of the year. I
think that the verdict of the

majority of people is neces-
sary. My verdict is that we
are being held hostage by an
unpatriotic few who think of
Namibia in terms of their own
benefit alone and who through
their access are misleading
public opinion. Commercial
farms are not touched now,
butare they able torespond to
the urgent need for food in
this country? I am pretty sure
and convinced that if access
to land was easy, the effect of
the present natural calamity
would not be the same. Be-
Cause more people could have
engaged in food production.

I want to point out that the
Namibian food market is rela-
tively stable because the pres-
sure is reduced by the com-
munal land which provided
71 per cent of the livelihood
of the inhabitants of those
areas. Now the population of
both animals and people is
increasing, and the ecology
has taken its toll because of
the way in which the land has
been over-utilised. The logi-
cal solution is therefore the
urgent need to solve this
question. We want our land
back.

Namibians from all walks
of life will commemorate
Heroes Day on August 26.

Significantly this is a
remarkable day, because of
the nature of the liberation

that day between the indige-

ters of this country and the
then colonial forces al
Ongulumbashe in the north-
erm part of the country.

Those liberation activities
germinated or brought about
national independence and
cemocracy. It has been a
bitter struggle as it was
depicted by the Honourable

cian Andimba Toivo ya

trial.

It was a life or death situ-

AS far as I am con-

needs an answer.

Before this issue was

some interest in the topic

information for an edu-

pending, as the question
remains unresolved.

As a histonan | was

Peace at last

a es a

PEACE has descended
py} upon Windhoek West

once again. The srudents

celebrated their ‘cul-
| tural’ festival and resi-
Gents were powerless tc
defend themselves from _
the onslaught. :

In case one is accused
of exaggeration, | am
talking about four nights
(I fell askeep by 3am) of
disco music blasting
| over the entire area -
_ | every syllable of every
| song trespassed closed

windows, locks doors,

earplugs - right into the
| furthest crevice of one’s
| | bedroom.

The police were also
powerless to restore
Peace because Vice-
Chancellor Peter
Katjavivi and Dean
Kandetu “had given their
permission”. Acomment
from the Minister of
Home Affairs would be |
appreciated on this point, :
Since when can two in-
dividuals muzzle the
police force from de-
fending peace-abiding
| cituzens?

A strange state of af-
fairs - Vice Chancellor
Katyavivi and Dean
Kandetu held control
over the police and the
Windhoek West taxpay-
crs, rate-payers, rent-
payers - those mere—
mortals who have to
work for a living.

The two University —
chiefs were indifferent |
to residents’ direct ap-
peals as well as police
wamings after the first
night's assault. This
could be due to several
reasons, all worrying:

- perhaps they had in
fact lost control;

- of perhaps they were
trying to ingratiate them-
selves with the students?
Very cheap!

- perhaps they consid- |
ered it an important les-
£0n in democracy for the
future leaders of our
country. Those privi-
leged students are more
entitled to rights than
workers.

Considering this was
not the first rowdy cam-
pus rumpus and thanks
to the two liberal univer-
sity heads, it will obvi-
ously not be the last, per-
haps Windhock West
rate-payers should de-

preciation of property in

IT is only when we the
civil servants are well-
informed about the eth-
ics and responsibilities
of civil servants that the
majority of staff mem-
bers will be able to ad-
just themselves to the
ongoing restructural
problem.

It is obvious that the
progress, pf any country.
is seriotisly jeopardised
when the civil servants
are not well informed
about the ethics and re-
sponsibilities of civil
servanis.

In his address during
the workshop organised
for permanent sceerctar-
ics at Gross Barmen, the
Right Honourable Prime
Minister, Comrade Hage
Geingob, emphasised the
following:

* gucucs al govern-
ment offices: .

* the need for perma-
Nenlsecretarics lO assess
people's feelings about
the quality of service they
receive,

* terminally buresu-
cratic offices:

*sense of commilment
and dedication;

* the use of the tel-
ephone:

* recruitment, promo-
tion and responsibility
and accountability.

IL is my personal un- |
derstanding that civil '
servants must be acutely
conscious of the crucial
role they play in achicv-
ing government abjec-
tives of bringing about
peace, orderly develop-
ment and prosperity to
the country. Obviously,
we can only achieve this
through the act of creat-
ing awareness and
through individual com-
mitment.

All the remarks made
by the Prime Minister
reflect the daily occur-
rence in individual
ministeries. Some per-
manent secretaries de-
cide to be exclusive and
some are so dismissive
that they are no longer in
contact with theirstaffin

in general. Some resort

According to EM

Civil servants are the
ambassadors and mirrors

[tis imperative to say
that the concept of being

ALLOW me to express the feelings of ruling party
Members in your newspaper. We in Swapo are
committed to democratic principles and therefore
Swapo ts calling on registered voters to exercise
their democratic nghts to vote in the coming general
elections.

We are not campaigning fora two-thirds majority
but for the overwhelming majority to rule this
country. Itis nota seeret that we are ruling, and we
have and will continue to rule Namibia according to
the democratic structures put in place by Swapo.

We in Swapo believe and know that democracy
will stay forever in this country.

Other parties have often relied on tribalism and
racism to promote their cause and they therefore can
claim to represent Namibia as a whole. It should
therefore be a wonder that Swapo has provided four
and a half years of peace and tranquility in Namibia.

We live in peace today because of the commit-
ment of Swapo to seck unity in diversity in our
country.

In spite of the fact that some opposition parties
have insulted S wapo leaders personally, itis Swapo’s
leadership and maturity that has never wavered
from the commitment to freedom of speech.

In the past years Swapo has committed itself to

nation-building, knowing that Namibians deservea
government that has priorities as they do. The
Swapo leadership has ensured development and
they also believe there must be contact between
government and people at all levels. That 1s why
Swapo has branches and sections at grassroots
level.

The Foreign Investment Act was passed, which
regulates the framework tor foreign investors. In-
come tax was reduced twice. Job creation was one
of the top priorities.

In the next five years Swapo’s priority will be to
secure existing jobs and create new ones. For exam-
ple the Free Trade Zone will create more Jobs for
Namibians and that is part of Swapo’s priorities for
the next five years.

Tourism will be expanded and housing, water,
electricity, education, health, agriculture and fish-
eries will be promoted.

Therefore in the next five years Swapo will accel-
erate change by creating new opportunities for
Namibians through economic growth, better educa-
tion and health services and more Jobs.

_ questions as to whether Swap: <>

fulrilled the promises it made in 1989
an how many people have used the
Falcon jet?

Of course Swapo fulfilled its prom-
ises, We are now living in better hous-
ing, have better communication fa-
cilities, better education, better
healthcare and Swapo has also re-
duced the unemployment rate. We are
how living in peace, no more
‘makakunyas’ destroying our maize
fields and beating up people and
Swapo has buried apartheid forever.

With regard the jet, how many peo-

ple does Mr Muyongo feel should
have used it? Does he want everyone
to use 1t? The Falcon is not a taxi but
wan sport for the President and his Min-
isters.

I strongly believe people will not
vote DTA and that they will lose the
forthcoming electicns with no single
seat in Parliament.

President Nujoma should not con-
cern himself about the DTA in the
coming elecuons. Swapo will make
sure he rules this country for the rest of

2. The Zionist regime has the
maximum budget for purchase
and production of deadly mass
destruction weapons like the
nuclear bomb, and ts in fact the
only country which is a major
threat in the region, as far as
deadly mass destruction weap-
ons are concerned.

3. However, Israel never al-
lowed any of the experts from
the International Atomic En-
ergy Agency to inspect any of

its atomic energy installations.
whereas the Iranian atomic en-
ergy installations were in-
spected by these experts who

confirmed the peaceful aim of

the Iranian nuclear production.

4, Islamic Republic of Iran is
a member of the NPT (Non-
Proliferation Treaty) agreenicnt
and the Government of the Is-
lamic Republic of Tran is fully
committed to this agreement.
But the Zionist regime 1s nota
-member of this agreement and
they never signed the agree-
ment. All the neighbouring
countries of Isareal are being

threatened by the Zionistregime’s
nuclear activity which 1s against
peace. stability and security tn

5. The USA and Isracl now has
the plan to draw big negative pic-

ity in order to frighten the neigh-

letter the Minister
maintained hiy views
had no links with Na-

kind of genetic engi-

letter, whether inten-
ttonal or not, echoes the
very worst aspects of a
Nazu-style philosophy.

We have read with in-
creasing abhorrence
some of the remarks
made by the Minister in
his three letters, which
we publishedonly inthe

that Minister Hanekom
Is essentially advocating
a regulated market, sim-
ply for the sake of what
he hopes will be some
degree of Peace in the
industry. But such a
compromise will not
bring peace, because it
will not address the one
question that we have
always posed: Why
should successful small
businesses be driven out

‘of Business, just because

they are small?

Mr Johnnie Hamman,
the new chairperson of
HAN, is reported as Say-

ing that HAN has re-
duced its demand for a
minimum number of
rooms, from ten to five
“to enable new legisla-

Saying this, he pretends
that HAN have made a

Spinit of generous com-
promise, by stating that
although we cannot ac-
cept the wiping out of
the business of 95 per
cent of our members, we
will accept the destruc-
tton of 65 per cent? Or
would 55 per cent be
Sufficient for Mr
Hamman and HAN?
What Mr Hamman
and some members of
HAN are Proposing is,
in fact, much more than
the destruction of, say,
thirty or fifty successful
small businesses. They
are proposing that new
legislation should out-
law the prospect of most

Namibians ever being
able to share in the ac-
commodation imdustry
of their own country in
an cnurcpeneurial way.
They are effectively pro-
posing that no home-
stead in the north of Na-
mibia should be able to
offer accommodation to
tourists. They are effec-
lively proposing that no
resident of, say, Rundu
or Otjimbingwe should
employ the facilities at
her or his disposal to of-
fer accommodation
commercially. They are
effectively proposing
that no Namibian with-
out access to capital re-

» Mr Hanekom

sources of at least half a
milton dollars (at inter-
est rates of above 20 per
cent) should be able to
enter the accommoda-
tion industry. And they
are demanding that the
Namuibtan state should
ratify this discrimination
against its own citizens.

We call upon the me-
dia and the public to rec-
ognise that this issue is
not simply a matter of a
disagreement with HAN
and the Budget and
Home Accommodation
Assocrauion. It is a mat-
ter of principle: and that
principle involves the
question of whether or

not the majority of
Namibians, who were
denied meaningful ac-
cess to economic activ-

continue to be denied it
under new legislation of
the type proposed by
those who benefited -
and stull benefit - under
the outdated Ordinance
20 of 1973. If members
of HAN are successful
in their demands, then
economic reactionaries
in other sectors will be
encouraged to attempt
the same.

found that the alarming increase in
crime in our socicty to be a very wor-
rying factor. There are different types
of crime in our country, ¢.g. theft,
murder, rape, metal and physical abuse,
etc. Crime isa wrong committed against
the state for which criminals are pun-
ished. It is depressing to know that a
crime iscommitted nearly every minute
of the day and that someone in our
beautiful country is either being in-

feeling or conscience. People must
cooperate with the police in order make
their jobcasier. Parents should keep an

eye on their children and act immedt-
ately if they suspect that there ts Cause
for concem. Also, youngsters should
avoid places like night clubs because
these are very dangerous places for a
young person to spend time. The time
has come for the public to take a visible
stand against people who wish to pro-
mote lawlessness in our socicty. They
should be treated like enemies. I call on
all Namibians ... Iet us all go down on
our knees and pray to God to intervene
and to bless us with peace, love and
understanding. As long as we allow
criminals to enjoy a free reign in our

YES. thisishow we have

atl fourned of the death

Of Moses Garocb. Now
hat he as dead, Moses
Gurocb will be a differ:
ent man. Different from
the Moses Garoeb who
lived during the libera-
tion movement. On the
occasion of his death,
may I convey, through

this newspaper, my con-
dolences to those who
loved and appreciated
him as father and hus-
band.

May the “unusual” re-
avuion to his death make
them an exception. At
this ime of sorrow f do
Not want to add insult to
injury of Mr Garoeb’s
fumily.

Mfoses Garoeb dies as
inan with guileon fis
mind. He has totally

failed to openly admit
thathe was, together with
others, responsible for
murdering many inno-
cent sons and daughters
of the country. Although
he died a troubled death,
he is in his motherland.
He was buried as a
“hero” in disguise.

fam bitter. Moses
Garoeh has left his Po-
hitroal successors to in-
berst blood stained

“files”,

In that sense his death
isunumely. They are left
with unanswered ques-
tions about the Lubango
genocide.

I have always urged
Swapo leaders to clear
this dark part of our re-
cent history, but with no
SUCCESS.

Will we have to wait
until the last butcherdies
and been afforded a he-
ros funeral before we
find answers to this ques-
ton?

Today many families
are cry ing for their loved
ones who were murdered
by the notorious Swapo
security menin Lubango

of which Moses Garoeb
made a part. He has never
been and will never be a
hero as far as I am con-
cemed. I have seen him
victumising us. Lucky
enough, I have survived
to tell the tale. For as
long as the fate of the
Lubango victims is not

cleared | will die with a

troubled hean and Na-
mibra wall never know

genuine peace.

I know just as every-
one does, that anyone,
good or bad, can be
named a hero as long as
his/her comrades are in
power. That is why the
“heroes” of the apartheid
era are now removed
from the face of Na-
mibia. Streetnames have
been changed because
friends of the apartheid
“heroes” are no longer
In power.

For those who glorify
Moses Garoeb as a hero
of the Namibian people,
Justremember that he di-
rectly participated in the
brutal killings and exter-
mination of my brothers
and sisters in Lubango
and Zambia.

We are still mourning
their deaths. Our parents
did not have the privi-
lege tobury their beloved
children and husbands.

I started this paper by saying Nujoma should go
and not have a third term. Why? The regime that I
have descnbed here is HIS. He is the President! He
has the power to change through dismissal, effec-
uve reshuffling of his cabinet, caforcemen of
policy, maintaining political serutiny of his politi-
cal employees (the Ministers, Deputies, PSs etc).
He had almost eight years to prove that he is not
only from Kahao, but from each part of the coun-
try. That instead of constructing a tarred road to his
own homestead, he coulc have constructed one to
Hosea Kutako's homestead as a gesture of revols-
tionary appreciation and unselfishmess. |: :

but if there 1s no peace, this nauon is doomed.
The government and the people of this country must
work hand-in-hand for acommon goal: rebuilding and
development of the land - and put their social, reli-
gious and cultural differences aside. The government
which was elected by the people and which has armies,
bombs and other killing materials should not abuse the
national patriotism to oppress, harrass and persecute

those holding different political opinions.

People musthelp the government and pay their taxes
and, as the recipient of these taxes, the government
must construct roads and allow loans for agricultural
development.

As a woman, I see peace as a birthday cake. It takes
a lot of ingredients: patience and love. Peace is not
created by one person. A refugee woman is the target
of rape, violence, harassment, prejudice and mostly
the offenders go free, unpunished and ready to repeat
their offences. There is no tangible ‘piece’ of peacc.
Peace must be whole and enjoyed by all the people of
the country. Peace is a woman who needs to be taken

care of. Welcome Peace.

__Swapo Has Lost Its Vision For Namibia

TO us young people of

this country during the

years of the 1960s and

1970s, Swapo sy mbolised
the mage of equality. jus
tice and freedom for all
the people of Namibia

The prevailing situation

sion, denial of justice and

greater Majority of the

Nason where all
Namubians live in peace
and tranquillity, where no
Namibian would again be
a political refugee or flee
their homeland because of
politcal intimidation and
tear

It was because of this
common vision that the
support for Swapo was so
broad among the Nami-
bian people. It was be-
cause of this common vi-
sion that the support for
Swupo was unwavering.
For many it was a vision
for which they were pre-
pared to sacrifice their
fnends, family and posses-
sions.

For many others it was
a vision for which they
wese preparcd to lay
down their lives. For
many today, however, the

 . -_£.. ._._ i fh

shining vision of Swapo
has become a great disap-

Pointment. Vow muany Unies
vision thes shattered.

Why?

In simpke terms. Swapo
has for the past cight ycars
that it has been in poltucal
power in Namibia, done
nothing but emulate all the
evils of the past apartheid
regimes. Tt has instituted
one of the most corrupt
systems of self cnnchment
by political leaders and
their close friends and
relatives, [thad created an
elite system whereby a
small clique denves all the
benefits atthe detment of
the deprived. poverty
stncken population, [thas
insttuted tnbalism of the
most naked kind in the
civil service and
parastatals.

The Swapo-govern-
ment has squandered our
resources by the mishan-
dling of the national
budget as was again re-
cently pointed out by the
Auditor General. It is ap-
parent that the Swapo
government ts just not in-
terested in maintaining

any fiscal or monetary
discipline.

Vive de the renult of
competent and unquah
fied people being ap-
pointed to responsible
positions merely on the
basis of their ethnic and
tibal ongin. The govern
ment ts using legal means
to achieve illegal ends It
is thus clear that the ac-
tions of the present
Swapo leadership have
deviated drastically from
the capectauions of the
masses of our people

That brings us to the
crucial questions at us
juncture in our histors
WHAT IS TO BE
DONE?

That is the question that
was asked by Lenin when
Mother Russia laid: shut
tered because ot
maladministravon, cor
tuption, cthnte contlicts
and Tsar dictatorship This
question also has to be ane
swered by Nammbians al

ples are plentiful, but for

two will do for now
* The Movement for

whose only claim to

Kaunda and UNIP The

MMD capitalised on the

One may ask ‘but
what has this got to do
with Namibia?’ Well,
everything. Namibia got
its independence on the
morrow of the new
monopolar world domi-
nated by the USA. The
Western countries first
regarded themselves as
midwives of Namibia’s
independence, now they
have gone further and
granted themselves the
rights of a parent! They
forgot the Namibian
Goverment has a mind
of its own. Swapo set out
to create a Namibia en-
trrely in its own image
and to re- integrate it into
mother Africa

To top it all, Swape ts

that Westemers hate, and
vice versa

* Swapo started op-
Posing homosexuality,
like Mugabe. In the West
homosexuality 1s a fash-
1on statement

* They started to be
vocally pro-Afnca.

* They started to
amend the Constitution

dential term The West

Germany Helmut Kohl

fourth, wrong. fifth
term. The UK still does
not have a written con-
stitugion while ours ts in

* Worst of ali, Na-

sending troops to the

Mugabe.

... And So Do Liberation Movements

WHY as it that fiberation movements, whenever they ing ground for lazy. unaccountable, non-transparent,
come into power over Afnca, tum out to be quite a

uademocratic, unresponsible, complacent : and ha

Dunng the stroggle and after independence, the ex- 4
pectations of the masses run very high. Leaders are ¢
regarded as heroes who would deliver the long-awaited . extied

* Now Namibia is op-

So Namibia must be
punished. But how?
There ts no economic

bility On the contrary,
there 1s peace and stabil-

it! How about creating a
‘wirtual crisis’ Yet the

there be headlines about

Previously the Rehoboth Mission was infiubited by
the Swartboor Nama clan, but by the tine tic Basters
amved, they had abandoned the area for Ogimbingwe
because they were involved with conflicts with Jan
Jonker Afnkaner.

The Basters never took land or anything clse from
anybody in Namibia. The Rehoboth area where they
first settled was totally unoccupied and an open area
devoid of Nama or Hereros. Numencally it was also

Upossble tor small clans like the Swartieans ead

1 AM a Kavanyo student
based in Windhock and
would like to express my
concern about the ongoing
banditry activities in my
region. I have seen that the
crists situation in the
Kavangois going from bad
to worsc.

Government's reaction
towards this problem ts a
complete nddle to me.
What is the use of just sit-
ting in luxurious offices,
peacefully and quietly,
while life is really a living
hell in the Kavango. The
Government should rather
find a solution to this mat-
ter, instead of just saying it
is the people of the
Kavango themselves who
are collaborating with
Unita.

Let’s come to a reason-

-able solution - instead of

wasting our tme on re-

aa _ ~

eruminauions against cach
other. This situauon where
Kavangos cannot even
enjoy the basic pleasure of
peace, progress, prosper-
ity and stability should not
conunue like this. [feel we
need the total deportation
ot the MPLA from Nami-
bian soil. Zambia has done
it, Why not Namibia too?
One thing the Govern-
ment should be aware of is
that Unita’s banditry ac-
vities are always onCNN
and this will discourage
More tounsts trom com-
ing to Namibia. So we will
lose anyway, as our coun-
try’s economy depends on
tounsm and this is reason
enough for foreign busi-
ness people not to invest
their shares in Namibia,
especially the Kavango.
Some of the schools in
the Kavango, like Max

Makushe Secondary
School, fans Shastipapa
and others won't have
physical science or math-
ematcs teachers. The yol-
unteer teachers won't be
interested in applying to
these schools due to the
unstable situation in the
Kavanyvo. In this way the
economy and academe
issucs will vradually be
aftected ;

So the Government
should not yust stand by.
must do someting - de-
mand the total withdrawal
of the MPLA trom the
Kavaneo

Unita bandutry activities
should not only be

Kavangoconcems, butthe

whole of Namibia as ‘one

Nanubia, one nation’.

one judge was reported as saying the

to the illiteracy of the voters or the

According to that judge's state-

ALLOW me to clear up
and elaborate on what has

' become a controversial

hot potato on the name

, change for Capnvi.

Who was Caprivi to
start with? Caprivt was a
German Cuptain in the
German colonial army.
Shortly betore they were
defeated by the British
and the South Afmean
forees, Captain Capris
and his torces quickls
decided in that short ses-
sion held at then Head-
quarters: Schuckmianns
burg (o naine the region
Caprivi in addition of the
existing Henge name

This was decided ta
have a two-fold connota-
tion. Firstly as a landmark
that Clearly states that the
entire Namibia was calo-
mised by Germany. See:
ondly. wath the name
Capri intact it was casy

for Germany to reclaim
the entire country back
after the war and review
allsigned agreements with
Britain.

A name change for
Caprivi is long overdue;
Was supposed to change
subsequently after rade-
pendenee in 1990.
Change is inevitable and
we cannotrun away from
It

Why the name change?

SThe scrambling of
Aftcan history teaches us

that most Afneans come
from the Great Lakes
where the name Capnvi
never existed, hence it
only came alive in 1915.
(Note: languages existed
before the name Capny1)

nothing in common with

Bad Enough Without The Photo

THANK you for your services and for
“sull telling it hike it is"", despite some
people who only like you doing that
when it is in their favour. But today’s
front page (Wednesday January 30)
is beyond the limits of what we need to
know. In other words: the picture on
today’s front page is below your level
of journalism and nears your paper to
the low level The Windhoek Observer,
which I stopped buying when it pub-
lished the picture of the French chil-
dren that were murdered on the Caprivi-
Highway some years ago.
If I read in an article that a young man
killed his grandmother for N$SOO in

cash than this is bad enough. If I then
have to read that he used an axe, it is
more than enough. How should my
level of information be enhanced by
seeing the picture? Instead I would
rather like to know how a person can go
so far, better. how can a young person
lose his human and social values to
such an extent? What do the neigh-
bours and relatives say? How do they
think that they (and us) can prevent
such gruesome crimes in future?
Why are these kinds of crimes so much
increasing nowadays? How did people
deal with them traditionally? etc. It is
this kind of question I would rather be

interested in than seeing a dead kuku

with an axe in her head. Peace to her

soul. | am also concemed about the

feelings of the family of the victim and

the culpnt not to menuon all the other
people like desperate youngsters who
sec this picture. Why do they need to be
exposed to such atrocities? Do you
expect to sell more newspapers when
they have such pictures on the front
page? Please keep the quality level we
are used to from your paper and leave the
cheap and sensationalist journalism to
people who don’t know better.

1 DON’T know who has
both authority and wis-
dom to answer what
seems a simple question
but an important one.
Such as: is peace in sight
inourregion? Maybe our
finest, credible and most
able political analysts,
diplomats and politicians
based in the region and
outside the region are, of
much help to guide and

for this to happen now,
rather than previously.
And it can be said with
certainty that to let the
chance slip away with-
out bringing peace to
Angola would be
shortsighted on the side
of those involved in the
peace . It would
be difficult to do so in the

much needed foreign in-
vestment and so lessen
some of the burden which
is so heavy on our shoul-
ders that we are unable to
step forward as a region.
For that reason let peace

prevail over war, let
peace rise above all dif-
ferences and ultimatcly
reign supreme in the re-
gion.

When Headmen March On 4th Term

THE recent marching of Swapo kings and head-
men is a wrong move. It’s a pity that our people,
when they are in numbers sup the same
idea, think they are right. They think that means
“one Namibia, one nation”. What we must think
of is what the fourth term means for us as Namibian
nation, not to make one man happy. What is the
extent of its advantages and disadvantages? The
fourth term is costly. It will lead to more hunger
and poverty. Peace can never be maintained by an
individual human being, unless it is deserved by
all.

The demanded referendum is an additional
election. Where will the millions of dollars come
from? Will the nation be sacrificed again for an
individual advantage and benefit? Are we really
serious? To change the constitution to allow a
fourth term means money (millions). This burden
will be put on the already suffering Namibian
shoulders. Hearing the Government has

and hence we have a very limited inte; a sto the

The money will be misspent as we still have a
high unemployment rate in the country and those
in the recent youth service scheme from
Grootfontein could be employed. Or is it Swapo
party that will fund the referendum?

The extent of love within a human being is the
same as hatred. Chiluba in Zambia is an example
of the peoples’ turning point from love to hatred.
Next, the same people who are chanting. “We did
not sleep, we want Sem blah, blah”. They will
call for prosecution after they discovered the dis-
respect of our country’s constitution by him and
the misuse of our country’s limited resources for
individual benefit. Which reasons will they give
and what difference will they make between the
current President and his successor who will be
demanding a third and fourth term? He will also
be liked and supported by a majority like Netson
Mandela and Bil) Clinton. It is the same type of
people who will march again then.

correctly, in the 1990s we had what was
Called Operation Desert Seomm, the war
that was aimed at rag. Now again it
seems like we are again to see the second
pant of the operation, now being headed
by Bush Jr.

Bush Sr. headed the first part and now
we are again to see the other Bush tying
to continue where his father left off. Go-
ing to war_with Iraq will not be the
answer, it will only destabilize the peace
in the Muslim world. Is there any con-
crete proof that can implicate Saddam
Hussein in producing weapons of mass
destruction’ If there is not enough proof,
why is that the US is concerned with
going to war with Iraq?

I feel that we will pot be able to enjoy
peace even for one yeas, because the

Washington povemment will try to cre-
ate war whenever there is peace.
Is there not any single soluuon, which

can prevent the innocent people from
dying unnecessary deaths?

If the British government and the Wash-
can’t they try first to resolve the Middle‘
East crisis and then try to deal with Iraq?
What about the United Nations? Is not the
yob of the UN to see to i that no one can
be a threat to anyone? If we live in peace
and work for acommon goal, which 1s to
alleviate poverty and find the cure of
AIDS, wecan live better, instead of send-
ing millions of dollars in weapons, which
can destroy and kill people, we can use
that money to good use.

America will never get nd of its en-

towards some countries. Change will be

better for everyone.

A Pain For The Youth

[ WILT. always be saluting the patron-
age of this widely read and informative
newspaper. The Nanubian newspaper
sull has the monopoly in terms of good
reporting both dunng the colonsal and
post colonial period - its still reporting
things as they are.

The aforementioned statement can-
not be defeated by any useful and re-
sponsible Nammbian citizen. The gov-
ermment does things without looking at
the mmpheations associated with its ac-
tions. One would always wonder 1f the
top government officials, including the
President, have advisors at all. Being

unemployed, we the youth of this nation
learnt with dismay of the government
ban from advertising inthe Namibran. It
Is very expensive for us Job seekers to

shameful to come back to The Namibian
itmust establish a free of charge weekly
paper where we can get the govemment

need to campaign for the next electcns

Concerned Swapo Man
Windhoek

Right Wing Afrikaners, Take Note!

TREAD with shock and dismay in The Namibian of
November 12 about the activities of the so called
‘Boer nation warriors’. I want to express my views.

Ido not know whether the “boerevolk Krygers”
elements are also present in Namibia, but if there are
such members or those who are aspiring to such
ideas, keep such ideas dormant infinitely. It is
friendly advice.

I am very concerned about this terrorist move-
ment causing havoc tn South Africa with its result-
ant destruction and disregard for human life and
property. This movement, although it has been in
existence for years, has surely come at the wrong
time. Those conservative, radical boers must know
that they do not live in Utopia whereby theywant to”
promote the ideology of Aryan nationalism. They
must learn to live with diversity. We are all people
of different colours and that we have to live side by
side. No one ts superior or inferior to the other. To

be bad 1s not an inherent character, it ts a learned
habit due to the environment in which one is raised.
Anyone can be bad.

Criminality is not confined toa specific race. No!
Itis part of human existence and under certain social

circumstances and living conditions anyone is a

potential criminal.
This reminds me of what Mr Hannes Smith (edi-

tor of Windhoek Observer) once wrote. I quote. ‘No
man/woman ts born a criminal. Criminals are made
by conditions, environmental factors, to say noth-
ing of social conditions”. How true are those words
from an open-minded person.

Those who are aiming to wipe out the black nation
(in case of Soweto) must know that the black man
can act in the same way. Does it sound inciteful or
a threat (o you? Maybe, but not to me. Together we
can make or break this world.

Nine bombs in all were enough to take away many
innocent lives.

When one’s livelihood is threatened. you invent
ways to counteract in order to protect yourself to
survive. Let us live in peace rather than war. War ts
bad so let us avoid racial hatred since we did not
choose who we are. Let us find lasting pragmatic
solutions that would see us through to the next
development level. Life was meant to be lived by

all. No one has a patent on life.

WE read with shock and dismay the
artcle by the “brave” but nameless
‘Editorial staff members’ of Namibia
Today. This article is an unambiguous
declaranon of war by this newsletter
and I am ready to enter the battle
whatever the consequences.

The so-called wrong platform: The
Memonal service took place in the
Ephesians congregation of the Evan.
gelical Lutheran Church in the Repub-
lic of Namibia and for the information
of the ""Editorial staff members’ | am
the Bishop of that Church. Thus, I
used my own platform.

The late comrade Hilukilwa
Kandanga was a member of my
Church. She was not only a heroine,
but also a true Namibian who did not
only condemn tnbalism with her words

\

1 .

bot also very much with ber ows life.

Therefore, the timing of what I said
was correct, and within the right con-
text. It is also obvious that I woald not
ask permission from Namibia Today,
of anyone clse, for what I said on my
own platform!

My so-called attach on Swapo: At
no stage dunng my serman did I men-
uon the Swapo party or any tibe. I was
also not exclusive in what I said, but
very inclusive. I called on all of us, the
former oppressed Namibians, to also
look at ourselves and to correct whatis
wrong with us. The ‘editorial staff
members” accuse me of lies but they
are Shameless when they fabricate what
I did not say.

Happy About Fourth Term Cam

THE lingering debate and pos-
tunng by politcal pundits, tra-
ditional leadership, the ordi-

nary ciuzens and ‘outsiders’
about the need or not for Presi-
dent Nujomato run for another
term, the so called ‘Fourth
Term’ as Head of State, can be
likened to a rhinoceros, which
looks different depending on
where the observer is standing
and what portion of its anatomy
he/she 1s concentrating on.
Each perspecuve has some Par-
ucular insights andeachis only
a part of the whole!

As an ordinary Namibian
ciazen from the Caprivi Re-
gion, I am therefore delighted
to hear of yet another concerted
and well-orchestrated cam-
Paign to convince and/or urge
our President to seek another
term.

There 1s an American Say-
ing, “ifitain’tbroken, don't fix
10"". My position is simple and
gRoes something like thts: the
inconclusive leadership transt-
tion (no domestic pun intended
since mostof the senior leaders
in the Party and Government
are seasoned, tested and com-
Petent) that the recently held
Swapo Congress Produced,
raises important questions
about who will really be in
command should President
Nujoma step down after the
expiry of his current term.

While Iam a Breat believer
In ‘collective leadership’ (it’s
casy if you are one of the cho-
sen ones), I suppose I’ve be-
come disillusioned with poli-
tics - and I think most
Namibians have become disil-
lusioned with poliucians too.

An intellectual friend of
mine once commented,
“Namibians don't want to ac.
cepl excuses any more - if
there’s moncy tobe stolen, why
isn’t there money for the peo-
ple?” It would appear we sull
don't have our pnorities nghte.

Once upon a time I was al-
ways fixing everyone else's
problems, but not my own and
guess where it landed me?
What has all this to do with the
Fourth Term, you may ask?

Despite a mosaic of tnbula-
uons and misplaced pnonities,
every day I ask the question:
‘Can President Sam Nujoma
do no wrong?” The answer is
an emphatic NO.

Namibians love him above
all other Ministers and even
the feeble and weak Opposi-
tion grudgingly admires his

Poltucal talent. At his age,
President Nuyoma has lostnone
of his charisma he had in exile
and ts a man of al} Seasons
liked by all Namuibians from
any comer of this great nation
of ours.

Perhaps the Breatest asset
credited to President Nuyoma
IS ZOOd governance.

Since independence on 21
March 1990 delivered high lev-
els of security, provided qual-
ity educaton and health serv.
Ices, respected political
freedoms and human nghts,
framed a strong rule of law,
bolstered an economic frame-
work conducive to growth and
has provided an environment
in which civil society can flour-
ish.

Hence, there 1s a direct cor-
relauon between good national

bovernance and economic
Prospenty

Ordinary Namibians havea
mght to expect a better life af-
ter all the sacnfices they en-
dured during the liberation
struggle. People do not fight
for ideas but for peace, mate-
nal benefits anda better future
for their children.

The majority of Namibians’
€xpectauons of independence,
namely, their sincere hope that
freedom from colonial Tule
would usher in a new era of
basic rights and freedoms long
denied by settler rule. This 1s
What the liberation struggle
meant for ordinary Namibians.
President Sam Nujomais there-
fore an embodiment of the
aforementioned ideals.

The big question for Pres-
dent Nujyoma, therefore, is not

paign

as much opposition from ann-
chair critics from the West,
amateur poliucians of ‘op
SIUON parties’ but the envy of
his own colleagues, some of
whom have bowed out due to
their politcal naivete.

President Nuyoma has one
Tule he says something each
day and in such a manner that
it becomes the talk of the na-
tion He 1s therefore in the Spor-
light most of the ume - all of
which impresses the Namibian
voters and makes his fellow
politicians seethe with jeal-
ousy

that human solutions would be

urgent because of the threat of
war between nations, ethnic tribes,

ton, other threats imperil life on

and war has become even more
precanous. Where is this leading?
The United Nations wamed: “We

about 100 million people have

won't the fear of nuclear weap-

LHAVEbeen sick and
depressed since yes-
terday after reading
and seeing the horri-
ble picture of Geoffrey
Mwnilima in the cover
story headlined “Five
torture cases settled”
(The Namibian, July
8). 1 found it nauseat-
ing that fellow Nami-
bians can inflict such
an irreparable wound
on another in this
country of peace and
calm.

The most annoying
aspect of it is the so
called “out of court
settlement” was kept
secret thereby deny-
ing the publictheright

ture for the masses to

ALL I can say is thank God The
Namubian didn’t accept Batfour
Ankomah’s challenge to reprint
his entire lecture in full. Pm allin
favour of fantasy fiction but after
reading Baffour’s lengthy,
obscenely self satistied and
patronisingly racist letter in The
Namibian (not to mention
watching him in person blathering
away on Talk of the Nation), Pd
have to say that Namibia has
suffered enough,

Begone, Batfour! Go back to
your cruel exile in) your
comfortable London flat with its
potholed road (not to mention
fancy restaurants, political
security and snappy boutiques)!

Or better sal, if you think that
potholes are a serious indictment

of Western values, cut the poor
British some slack, hop ona plane
and leave them 1n peace as well.

Take your mercenary little rag
of a magazine with you. Open a
newspaper office in Zimbabwe,
perhaps.

I hear there’s one currently
vacant in Harare and you've got
the Zanu-PF government line
down pat. Lassume thatMugabe’s
people pay you. Or at the very
least fly you around showering
you with free hotel rooms and
bodyguards. Baffy, my little
exiled buddy, tell me I’m wrong!
Can't. Can you?

One final suggestion.

How about returning to your
native Ghana? You can’t still be
inexile surely? Not after all these

years? Not when you love Africa
so much and know so much about
this great continent. Not after all
the political change that has taken
place in Ghana? And you, Batfy,
stl in exile?

Or perhaps you are. Given your
morbidly turgid prose, your
depressing dictatorial arrogance,
your inability to write a simple
letter without giving a moderate
newspaper reader (me) dyspepsia,
and the sheer lunacy of your stance
onissues suchas HIV-AIDS, how
wonderful it ts to live under
Mugabe, and the evils of press
freedom, perhaps you are.

Yes, perhaps you are.

On Sunday morning, (7
March 2004) I was
surprised and excited to
hear an American Voice of
Islam, coming out ot NBC
radio. That was between
8h30 to 9h30. The program
was basically focussed on
the “Importance of
Conscience” in bringing
about God-consciousness,
when adhered to properly
by any criucal and nght-
thinking human beine.
The presenter, whospoke
with an American accent,
was talking about the
similarities between certain
Biblical and Quranic

statements on the issue of

conscience and God-
consciousness. AS oa
Namibian Muslim, [ was
naturally happy to hear our

an Islamic message,
moderately, wisely and
scientifically presented. All

very much NBC Radio!

Speeches, Please!

NAMIBIAN voters havea right to be informed inorder
to cast their votes with commitment and maturity as
far as their future is concerned. [tis in that context that
we - again - request “leaders” to stick to the rules of
democracy and free and fair elections.

Mr. Tyirtange, your previous position as Minister of
Justice should have instilled a respect for the Namibian
Constitution in you. That should at least reach as far as
knowing that it is NOT SWAPO that created the
Namibian Defence Force, Police, Civil Service etc. etc.
- that is an obligation every Government of a country
has.

Swapo is just another political party and not the
Government. Sic - we do not live in 1960 anymore - the
year 2044 1s here and we have and want to move on.

We all have an understanding that you might still
fee! bitter about your past - let us, however, look ahead
and rather work for a future that does not bring back
those years. Namibia has so many problems that need
tangible solutions. Solutions will not be found by clinging
on to the past and asking weird questions hke: “What
did Ben Ulenga tell the Boers to be released?”

Absurd statements like “the CoD has been created
by colontalists”.

By the way, Sir, the CoD is a legitimate political
party and not an organisation. You can condemn the
“colonisers” till eternity - as fong as you, the Swapo
party, still depend on them for food assistance for
Namibians your statements boomerang.

Tell the voters why is it necessary to apply for N$37.7
million donor assistance to feed Namibians?

Teli the voters why only foreigners get major building
contracts these days?

Tell the voters why they - after 14 years of
mdependence - stul live in shacks and shambles?

Why is almost every municipality bankrupt in
Nambia? .

Why is each and every parastatal costing the
Namibian taxpayers milhons and millions?

Sir -yvouas former Minister of Justice - should cry out
loud: babies and toddlers are raped on a daily basis.
Criminals rule the country - Namibtans get murdered
for a few dollars - corruption never gets punished.

The hist, Lam afraid, is endless! The Police force ts ill
equipped. ill-trained - why would Windhock otherwise
ask for a Municipal Police Force?

The Namibian Defence Force - whois insane enough
to want to attack Namibia - Nambia does not need that
Force. The money could be spent on housing/educations
health services etc. etc. All these and many more
pressing issues and what can be done about it.

That makes up election material for many months —
Sir-notyour defamations and agitating hate speeches.

Howeser-af your attacks on the CoD are an indicator
to vo by - the Cob is doing a good job and giving you
ample reason to see an opposition in that party,

Mr Tjitianye, please come up with solutions for
Namibians since we all Know that the tax pavers — and
thatincludes opposition party members - pay for Swapo
rallies

We have peace in Namibia - thatis also a credit Co
opposition partes since we can argue in parliament
and don't hase to take up weapons - lets keep it that
way. please. and let's tackle Namibia's multuple

ALLOW me some space, please.
to remind some of your readers
that before they write about any
conflict around the globe and the
people involved init, todo some
research first on particular mat-
ters and to have a more realistic
approach.

A letter ta The Namibian
- ‘Condemn the Killers” - 1s an
example where the writer show s
his total ignorance about the
situation inthe Middle Eastand
Us people

The writer claims that Pales-
tinians are forergners inthe Hols
Land and should be expelled by
the Israclis in order to achieve
everlasting peace, He also writes
that Palestinians are not men-
uoned in Phe Bible or recorded
bs historians. In the letter he
cniucised European Union gov -
eramems for condemning the
ussassinauon of Hamas leader
Yassin by Psraclis.

This isn’t the place for me
to write about the 10 000-year
long history of these (vo great
nations which contributed so
much to world cultures in terms
of many discoveries, writings

and science. My sole objective
1s LO COrrecl MIspercepuions on
this particular issue

The fact is that the Arabs
and the Jews believe that they
descend from the same father
- Abraham. No-one is sure who
came firsttothe Holy Land His-
tory only tells us that Palestine
was first peopled by wandering
Stone Age hunters and that per-
manent agricultural settlement
appeared at Jericho about 8000
B.C) According to historical
claims Hebrew (Jews) tribes
arrived from the desert in Pales-
tine between the [4th and }2th
century BoC.and that roughly
the sume time the Philistines
invaded trom the sea,

The name Palestine is in fact
anadaptation troma Greek word
“the land of Philistines” and the
name ismentioned many times in
The Bible. First Book Gen 21:34
“Abraham lived in Philestia for
along me”.

Just for the record | would
like to mention that in 1918 the
Palestine population consisted
of 500 000 Muslim Arabs, 100
000 Arab Christians and 60 000

Jews.

At the time of the 1948 war,
more than 500 000 Palestinians
fled from their country to seck
refuge with Arab neighbours tn
every Arab country where thes
landed, they were treated as
second-class citizens, confined
to ghettos specially created for
them

Why EU governments con-
demn the killing of Hamas
leader Mr Yassinis because thes
believe that the assassination of
political leaders promotes more
violence and does not provide
a solution for either sides. Not
long ago, Swapo was just like
Hamas, on American terrorist
lists,andevervbody wouldugzree
with me that assussmation of its
President, Sam Nujoma, by the
former South African whtte re-
gime, would only have destroy ed
the relauionstip between blacks

tred; but would ulmately never

ELECTIONS would be fairif those who vote elected
their representatives freely without any pressure or
any form of intimidation or character assassination?
I strongly feel that (the Swapo Congress) elections
were not free and fair.

The sacking ofoursistonary, capable Hamutenya
just before elections and smear campatens against
him by Nujoma on several occasions will never
make this election free and fair.

I would notexpect any rational person to belies ¢
what has been said about Hamutenya by those who
did so, including the President.

We expected the President to tell the natlon and
the Congress in particular that these are tested
comrades and the every body should make his/her
own choice accordingly.

He ts now claiming that the Congress has voted
in the interest of the whole nation. This ts totally
wrong. The congress has voted for Nujoma’s un-
Known interests.

If the entire nation was afforded a chance to
elect, | think the results could have been different.
The fact that Pohamba came with a pre-prepared
speech for the victory shows us that the results
were predetermined and the transparency used in
the counting processes is questionable.

We considered Sam Nujyomaas the greatfounding
father of our natron and indeed a visionary leader

of Africa but this was not so. Nujoma ts increas-
inely becoming a hardcore despot. He thinks he can
turn things around, ceteris paribus. Firing senior
ministers and indeed cabinet members who served
for decades ts a big embarrassment to him and to
the public.

Does this mean Swapo party does not have iter
nal disciplinary procedures to deal with unfounded
defaming allegations’? He keeps on referring to
others as imperiatists and forgets that he went to
the same imperialists to negotiate for Namibia's
independence.

His prerogative is beigg seriously misused. Some
ministers are so much preferred that firing them
would destabilise the country’s peace and stabilits
and dissolve the gains of our hard-won mdepend-
ence. This is also a sign that Swapo ts slowly but
surely disintegrating.

I think this was the wrong decision at the wrong
time. All the peace loving Namibians (perhaps ex-
cluding despots, opportunists, presidential remote
controls, political armatures, and power-hungry

PROMPTED by the publication of

e\press my personal opinion on this very
SCTIOUS Issue.

} don’t think it would be necessary to
write or explain more about the grave
consequences of hate speech. Its all
well Known and documented in places
like Bosnia tthe country of my births and
Rwanda

Phave to mention that for many vears |

two allowed hate speech to be directed

the communists, hate speech even heavily

Here in Namibia where the building of
“one Namibia one Nation” and reconcill-
ation should be the priorities for the sake
of peace and stability.

We have destructive clements amony
the democratically elected publie figures,
like some government officials and upton

it very difficull to connect ther mouths
with their brains

What makes matters even worse. (heir
speeches are broadcasted, over and over,

IHOPEthistime my letter will ap-
pear, unlike the other vo or three
cases When you (unintentionally )
omitted them. Ewill copy itto the
other media, Just in Case.

I read the rather confusing, tf
not uninformed, opinion of Nadia
Ihuhua, where she was dissatis-
fied with Uutont Nujoma’s pres-
entation to the CHR in Geneva,
regarding the case of the Caprivi
secessionists.

Well, Nadia. like any other
Namubian, you have a right to air
your opinton as you did, so let me
do the same as follows:

How informed are you if you
label Cde. Paulus Kapia as one
of the “government officials”?
When last we checked Cde. Ka-
pia was a Party official. Nadia
rightly alluded to the need for us
to have “responsible and trans-
parent leaders who know what
isiMportantand what constitutes

human-centred

development” She ts right but
which humans are being referred
to? Tome. only leaders to the con-
trary will allow sucha vision to be
derailed by a tew elements

such as Muyongo and his
cohorts.

After all when we talk of hu-
man-centered development dont
we mean the people with a sense
of purpose, thatof sustainable de-
velopment, like the ones we have?
Or, Dowe mean the detractors, Ms
Ihuhua? Surely we do not mean
to spend all the scant resources
on the rights of the detractors
rather than on the pensions of our
elderly or HIV-AIDs patients?
Do you really think if we spend
millions of $ this case, we will
elevate our human rights record
internationally?

What about the right to five in
peace, the right to food. the right

The few people you are talking

That feeling of safety is a result of

The People Must Nominate

AS a peace loving Na-
mibian, | would like to
give MY Opinion ON OUT
democracy.

I would tke to start
with giving my advice and
Views to our democrau-
cally elected representa-
lives those are voting to
be nominated and those
who are representing us
now, more especially
members of parhament
(National Assembly and
National Council). Some
of our representatives do
not truly represent us.
because we, cilizens often

do not nomunate them in
the urst place. They are
representing thetr respec-
tive political party leader-
ship. Representatives who
have been sonominated by
their leaders, once elected
to office as parhamen-
tarians and councillors,
become subservient to
these leaders. Instead of
this representative being
accountable to the voters
they are only responsible
and accountable to their
political leaders who nom-
mated them. and who also
have the power lo remove

them. Therefore such
representauves Strive to
please their leaders often
iN patron-chent relation:
ships. Such relationships
are often maintained atthe
expense of the voters and
the general public. This ts
why once in their office,
most parliamentarians
and councillors may not
do what the public expects
them to do.

I know that these rep-
resentauves are not really
representing us because
cilizens are not the ones
who nominate them,

awe AlCl Ss Oe a Law

What! want toemphasis
is that: P can see that the
top-down appointment
of candidates is not a
vood way to go. Voters

have to nominate their

own representatives. Such
representauves nominated
by the voters themselves
know the needs of citi-
gens better than imposed
candidates do. Voters also
nominate a person who
they know and who they
trust. This system of the
top-down tashion of nomi-
nation must be stopped
and bottom- up fashion
must be introduced in the
political parties. | know
if we do this, our country

ye eet mM

Will be a good example to
other countries. Further-
more OUF representauves
will be accountable to all
ciuzens. The representa-
tives nominated by voters
themselves will work in
the interest of their voters
and not in interest of their
political leaders. because
they know that Hf they
do not work in the inter-
est of their voters in the
next election they wall be
kicked out. | wrote this
letter because | know that
we as ciuzens really need
to be represented.
