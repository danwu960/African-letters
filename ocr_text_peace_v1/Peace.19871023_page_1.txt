Proud of police

1 WAS so confident that you and Ihave
a to be honest andseriousinour
relationship with each other. I had no
reason to doubt your intentions tocom-
municate with me in a mature man-
ner. I however intend to keep to our
bargain and refrain from being per-
sonal and cynical.

1. You can stop being presumptuous.
My promotion had nothing what-
goever to do with our relationship or
with my correspondence with The
Namibian.

proud to be a member of that Branch.
3 You will be surprised to learn that
my colleagues and I have had an avid
interest in the compound system for
more than 12 years. We have been
deliberating and negotiating with
numerous instances and governments
to abolish this system. The main
reasons, amongst others, where toen-
sure that those people who worked and
lived far from their home and their
families shouldbe given the chance to
live in peace and tranquility and
should not be controlled by Swapo’s
henchmen through intimidation and
victimisation. Secondly, we were con-
vinced that the majority of those
workers were honest people who
desired to be employed and to earn
enough money to support their
families, but that they inevitably
became, directly or indirectly, involv-
ed in the conflict between criminals
and the police.

4. If you or anybody else is seriously in-
terested to find out what if means to
live ina compound, I will be glad toar-
range a meeting with people who knew
the situation and whocan inform you
of the truth. I will ensure that you will
not be lied toor mislead by people who
profess to know the situation, but who
were never interested in the people liv-
ing in the compound.

§. The TGNU has declared more than
once in the past few months, and you
have reported these statements, that
the Katutura compound is the first to
goand that allsimilar systems ofhous-
ing people will be disposed with. My
colleagues and I do maintain an avid
interest in these projects too.

6. I do agree with you that there is
understanding for the argument con-
