Distortions

THE ARTICLES in the interim
government mouthpiece of 11.12.86
and 19.12.86, are malicious and a
blatant distortion of the truth. The
allegation against Mr Shapua
Kaukungua is that paper's own
fabrication. They are writing what
they probably wanted to hear. | am
not surprised by these lies, because
a system based on lies, cannot be
defended with the truth.

l repeat my statement made in the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in
Katutura at Mr Shifidi's funeral that
the “socalled government of national
unity is morally responsible for his
death”. The death of Mr Shifidi is an
urgent call on this ‘government’ to
step down, and in so doing, allow the
implementation of UNSC Resolution
435.

As long as this ‘government’ is in
power, it will be responsible for the
blood of the Namibians which has
been soaking the soil for more than
a century. What happened on that
fateful Sunday of November 30 last
year was not a mere ‘bakleiery’ as
that newspaper pretends. which is
why we are demanding an indepen-
dent judicial commission of inquiry
to reveal the truth.

I challenge Mr Eben van Zijl and
his government to allow the appoint-
ment of such a commission if ita (the
government) conscience is clear on
what happened that day.

Without justice there will be no
reconciliation and peace in Namibia.
