nature of the Union and ameared the

true Christian churchea and peace-

loving poople by depicting them as
cr

comic characters of political puppet
shows. Mr Mungunda, you failed to
check your facts before you picked up
a pen,

Yo can't call your Union a ‘truly
Christian body’ when it stated that
“we have no political prisoners, no
state of emergency. We have the right
of assembly and freedom of speech’

Against thisbackground your Union
proved itself anti-Christian and
anti-humaneneas.

Today we live under the ungodly
system of apartheid, which is devour.
ing the Namibian children, but your
‘truly Christian body’ stated that
‘human rights are being carried out
through the government on the basis
ofour BillofRights’” Onthecontrary,
on July 5, Swapo supporters were
beaten upon their way toa Swaporal-
ly and an eight-year-old gir) allegedly
beaten by police. Is this what your
Union refer to as ‘freedom of speech
and the right of assembly’.

In the north our people live under the
agony of horror and death. Church pro-
pertios are destroyed daily Isthishow
human rights are guaranteed by the
BillofRights? Here again your Union
provedclearly tobe the mouthpiece of
the interim government. All the socall-
ed ‘bishops’ appear to be DTA
members.

The ‘truly Christian body’ also
KLated that Swapo is not banned, but
today Swapo supporters and “sym.
pathisers ure the victims of Koevoet,
police and Nude vigilantes, who are in
the pay of the colonial government.
Then again you stated that Swapo
should not hire political priests to
negotiate surrender,

Swapo is a Namibian liberation
movement formed by the oppressed —
Namibians as a result of colonial.
racist, draconian laws imposed on
them.

Swapo is the uppressed people and
the oppressed people are Swapo And
the CCN Bishops are part and parce|
of the oppressed Namibians. They are
commilted Christians who are Dro.
Claiming the true Rospel of peace and
justice. They are not money
mongerers They are doing their dut \
as Christians ina society which is torn

by the evil of apurtheid and colonial
oppression.
Then vour Chiech Tle... so
