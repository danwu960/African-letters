efSorts simed ot community devel-
opment. The above has been pro-
posed by educationisis like Philip
Coomb and sketches a list of mini-
mum foaming needs dictated by the
demands of survival, self-improve-
ment and national development.

It would be extremely helpful if
you could publish or re-publish
materials based on the above in your
newspaper. It can help with the above-
mentioned research and can also be
used by the community as a resource
in development at all levels, i.e,
personal, communal and national.

I would also like to ask, m this
Jetter to the editor, for local commu-
nity resource persons like social
workers, community health workers,
legal aid workers, agricultural work-
ets etc., to send information on the
above to The Namibian or to myself
at the address underneath.

Agricultural information, for in-
stance, could include such things as
how to make a compost heap, plant-
ing cactus in dry areas, how to make
your own vegetable garden, cic.

I would really appreciate any re-

sponse.

No to homelands

THE tnbalists who are trying to
divide this country into homelands
must be made to remember that our
nation cannot tolerate such divisions
in Namibia. The land is one, and the

e are one. Our nation must stand
firm in unity to fight against all forms
of divisions and homclands in the

country. Things like the socalled
Republic of Rehoboth and Caprivi
cannot be tolerated in the would-be
independent Namibia.

_ Those who are involved in organi-
sing such things must repentand give
up such reactionary ideas immedi-
ately. This country is one, from the
Angolan border to the Orange River,
and from the Zambian border to the
Aduantic Ocean.

We find it disturbing that we still
have brainwashed Afncan (Namib-
ian) intellectuals who believe in
homelands and tibalism when we
have our heroes who have died for
the freedom of Namibia as a whole.
] just wonder from which books these
people have gathered such mislcad-
ing information.

These people should know that itis
utterly irresponsible and a marked
betrayal of those who died fighting
for the independence of Namibia as
well as the masses in this county.
Those people should also know that
their actions are a sign of mental
subjugation, and what J would call
the disease, requires an antidote.
Luckily, unlike Aids, an anudote is
available. People involved in declar-
ing homelands in Namibia must take
the undistorted history books and
read. perhaps this will make they
realise that they owe apologies to
faithful Namibians.

I appeal to our brothers and sisters
in Rehoboth and C aprivi not to sup-
port the people trying to lead them
into total nco-colonialism. All Na-
mibians must have the freedom to
live where they want to; and not be
confined to certain regions.

Swapo has been fighting to rid use
of the colonial yoke of South Africa
and the movement accepts all patri-
otic Namibians who want to be free.
Swapo condemns tnbalism, region-
alism, sexism, racism and above all,
colonialism. The people of Namibia
should be vigilant because the pup-
pets trying lo umpose homelands upon
them are creating civil war condi-
tions so that there is no peace ina free
Namibia. Our enemies are encourag-
ing these puppets to create
and antagonism among the poople of
our nation, so that there will not be
peace in a froe Namibia.

Namiblans should live in peace
and harmony and not in racial segre-
