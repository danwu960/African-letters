Victory Choir
needs promotion

LAM writing to you after spending almost. a month in
your Very beautitulcountry Cover Christmas 2003 and
into January 2004}

Tweas lucky enough to have the opportunity to visit
both the south and north of the country as well as some
of the coast with an excellent guide and a small group
of other foreigners from Varlous COUNTIES.

[also spent almost a week in Windhoek at the end
of my stay and visited the KRatutura Victory Women's
Movement. ] got to know the very capable director,
Katrina Crarises, and her colleagues there and the
choir sang for atriend from New Zealand and myself
—we were both very impressed by their performance.

Incidentally. [also meta reporter from your paper
the second ume T was there.

Ising inachureh chotr here in the north of Italy and
also with a small jazz band which generally makes ten
or Wwelve public appearances a year.

I sincerely feel that the Victory Choir should have
more opportunity to appear in public. both to let
people see how good they are and also as a way of
vetting funds tor their very important project

I would suggest that they could sing at the atrport to
Welcome international delegates arriving for meet
ings and congresses and at the larger hotels. like the
Kalahan) Sands. the Safar Court and the Country
Club Resort and Casino, where | feel sure that foreign
visitors would enjoy their performance.

I Know the choir would have transport problems to
get to the hotels, but | imagine that the hotels them-
selves would be able to arange that aspect of things.

[ would be most grateful if your newspaper could
print all or part of my letter and am also sending
copies of it to the above-named hotels for their
attention,

The Victory Women’s Movement deserves and
needs your help!

Betore I close. let me also say that travel extensively
as partot my yoband really enjoyed my stay in Namibia
-itnow holds a very special place in my heart.

I send you all my very best wishes for happiness,
vood health. success and peace
