HELMUT K ANGULA
MINISTER OF
FINANCE
WINDHOEK

* Note. In his opening
letter the Minister
maintained hiy views
had no links with Na-
usm, yer we find the
kind of genetic engi-
neenng proposedinthis
letter, whether inten-
ttonal or not, echoes the
very worst aspects of a
Nazu-style philosophy.

We have read with in-
creasing abhorrence
some of the remarks
made by the Minister in
his three letters, which
we publishedonly inthe
interests of free speech.
