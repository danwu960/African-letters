RE is another sfde tothe story of J
the socalled “Ten years of peace in East
Caprivi’ (The Windhoek Advertiser,
August 26). It has not had ten years of
peace as Brigadier Gert Nel suggests:
it HAS been ten years of humiliation
and intimidation.

Iregard this report as an attempt to
invalidate the very successful Swapo
rally held in the region on August 20,

as wellastodiscredit Capriviansin the
eyes of fellow Namibians. Brigadier
Nel’s tong report on the socalled ‘peace’
is mere propaganda.

Leaders have been intimidated and
harassed by the SADF and its counter-
part, Swapol, formerly SAP. The socall-
ed ‘leaders’, as claimed by Brigadier
Nel, are instruments used to further
the prevailing status quo. The tradi-
tional leaders are merely the
equivalents of the Katjiuonguas and
Matyplas of Namibia.

As regards what Brigadier Nel calls
‘cooperation’ between the army and
civilians, I have the following to say:

* intense psychological war is at work
in the region; 7

* the people do not admire the SADF
or SWATF, because it is not their army,
but South Africa's, The civilians may
‘cooperate with the army because they
need to survive; but itis not out of their
own will. Their fear is legitimate.

The bitter irony behind the creation
of 701 Battalion is that most young
men have joined the army as a last
resort. The rate of unemployment in
Caprivi is so high that people are left [
with two major options: to join the ar-
my, undesirable as that is, or become
a teacher. |

The SADF and Swapol have repress-
ed any sign of protest so that may give
an illusion of ‘peace’ in the region.

Regarding Enok/FNDC, this com-
pany may be credited with
monopolistic and exploitative prac-
tices in the region. It is notorious for
paying low wages, and they are cer-
tainly not contributing to any develop-
ment worth mentioning

The SWABC is nothing other thana
mouthpiece of the interim government
and ita masters in Pretoria: It is also
used to disseminate the kind of pro-
paganda which Brigadier Nel
