Peace not bullets

ALLOW me to inform you that
everybody says they want peace not
bullets in southern Africa. But words
are not enough. Action and Resolu-
tion 435 are needed urgently.
Racist South Africa is primarily to
blame for the havoc in the region of |
Namibia. Let South Africa withdraw
from Namibia. They must stopsuppor-
ting Unita bandits. And the gang of
puppets, the so-called Swapo-D, Canu,
DTA ete and South Africa must cancel â€”
all apartheid laws. We need peace nop
bullets from racist South Africa. = |
Ido not promise a perfect peaceafiar

all of these things are done, but some |
major problems will peers | ke pion |
