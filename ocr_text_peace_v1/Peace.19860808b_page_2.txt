of the apartheid policy. But only

Swapo is accused of terrorism.
President Reagan and his
followers should know that sanc-
tions against South Africa means
a lot to us: He should know that
the key to the liberation of this
country lies in his hands. He must
drop his capitalistic ideas and
negotiate with the South African

Government in order to accelerate

the implement of Resolution 435,

South Africa and its puppets
should know that as long as there
is no free election in this country,
there will be no unity or peace here.
South Africa should also stop its
interference in Angolan matters
and withdraw its forces from

_Angolan and Namibian soil.

I would like to tell our brothers
that we should stop killing and
discriminating against one another
and unite in order to facilitate the
goal of freedom.
