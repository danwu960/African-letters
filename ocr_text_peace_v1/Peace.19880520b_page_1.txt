No PLAN man

I READ in the people's newspaper (The
Namibian) last week that South
Africansecurity forceshad claimed to
have captured a PLAN combatant who
had been allegedly planning to
assassinate Mr Peter Kalangula.

This action is being rejected by all
peace-loving Namibians with thecon-
tempt it deserves. It is almost certain
that PLAN hasnothing todo withthe
man in question.

The proof lies in the words of Mr
Hidipo Hamutenya: ‘‘Swapo does not
consider Mr Kalangula as the real
obstacle to Namibia’s independence
for him to deserve Swapo’s particular
attention |

The people think that the person the
security forces has captured may be
South Africa's own instrument.

From my point of view this was an at-
tempt to cause hatred among the peo-
ple. South Africa is always trying to
divide us in order to facilitate their il-
legal rule over Namibia.

I feel this action was intended to
smear the name of Swapo and at the
same time to frighten and silence Mr
Kalangula who calls for the
withdrawal of the South African
Defence Force and the implementation
of Resolution 435, and to coerce him in-
to accepting the interim government
which was imposed on the people
against their wishes.
