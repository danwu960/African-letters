Swawec
accused |

AS an electrical engineers, a
former military man, and a
Nanubian painot who has
worked for Swawec for two |
years, J am not surpnsed that |
Mr Imker Hooggenhout, the |
General Manager of Technical |
Services of Swawec, has al-
legedly refused to disclose either
the sum of money, said to be
mullions of Rands, or the name
of the tenderer to remove |
numerous anti-personnel mines
planted on the Ruacana-Om-
buru powerline.

These nunes, which were
allegedly planted there to

“protect the powerline from
sabotage by Plan’’ guermuas,
has already inflicted casual-
ties interms of lives and prop-
erty of the unnocent local c1v1)-
an population for several years

Having intimate knowledge
of the discnminatory practices
of Swawec, I am not at ai!
surpnised about the reported
wide discrepancies in the pnce
for removing such deadly anti-
personne! mines.

But since Swawec 1s a par-
astatal corporation, | would
recommend thal the Minister
of Mines and Energy, Andimba
Totvo ya Toivo, institute a
thoscugh investigation into the
alleged discrepancies concem:-

ing the mine-re moving tender-

ers and what appears to be a |

veel of secrecy surrounding uns |

issue.

T am also not surprised by
Imker Hooggenhout's claims
that the removal of such mines
isa ‘very high prionty’’ sev-
eral months after two years of
peace in Namibia. Why was it
not a ‘‘very high prionty"” for

edly pobtically neutral engi-
neering company, or a respon-
sible electrical of electronics
engineer, could ask the SADF
to plant those mines around |
power pylons. As a ‘sialled, |
proficient and knowledgeabic’
electronics engimeecr from |
Stellenbosch University, Lmker
Hooggenhout, should have
designed anelectronic surveil-
lance system to protect the
powerline. Altematvely, if he,
for some reason, wasunable to
dJeagn such a system, only then
should he have asked the SADF
or Koevoet to regularly patrol |
such powerline

The steel pylons are ex-
tremely expensive and each

power pyloncosts at least RLU
OOO. And d00 world cost RA.
muilhon Also itr extremely
expensive and dangerous to
remove those moves. Can you,
as an engineer, guarantee thal
no human hfe or pylon wall be
destroyed in the process of
removing the mines, Mr
Hooegenbout? How much did
Swawee pay the SADF so
ren.ove such mines?

If they had not been your
munes, Sir, then such R23 400
O00 could have been used in the
trumng and re-truung of ‘non:
white’ Namibians in order to
meet the letter and spint of
Asticle 23 (1) of the canstitunon.
