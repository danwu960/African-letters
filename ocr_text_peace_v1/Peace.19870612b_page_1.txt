Whose AK-47's?

I WISH to raise a strong appeal tothe
South African army to withdraw from
Namubian territory.

It appears they are here to harass, 1n-
timidate and oppress innocent and
peace-loving Namibians.

As a member of Swapo anda Youth
League activist, condemn the latest
deeds of the army and police in the
Katutura hostel.
