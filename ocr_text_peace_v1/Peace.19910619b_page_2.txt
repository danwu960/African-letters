vering, they illegally allocated
the barest patches of land to
our people, taking over the best
farmland, today known as
commercial farming land.

IT know very well what hap-
pened in the south, central and
northem regions to my people.
They have relocated the Na-
masin socalled Namaland, the
Damaras were thrown away in
the barren western region, the
Hereros to the barren east and
north-east. Let it be known to
those who don't know or pre.
tend not to know that no amouni
of moncy or political manoeu-
vVering will stop the quest for
the regaining of our traditional
pastures.

We did not forget the past
We shall never do so. We want
our land back. They never
bought it from us. They anier-
change money toour debit and
continued misery and poverty.
Weare not asking fer a fai

Why, Ms Editor, do you think
thatthe majonty of Numag and
Damaras are the poorest to-

socalled Hereroland is so
trampled? Simpty because their
land waa stolen. Why do you
think northern Namibia is fast
becoming a desert? Simply
because their land including

Etosha and Trumeb area was

robbed?
