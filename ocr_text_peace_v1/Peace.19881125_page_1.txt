IN SUMMARY: It has not bean the ob-
jective of this brief article to riticise
what was said, or not saidJ at the
Lusaka conference. Indeeg the con.
ference was a significantand welcome
political developmest: Rather, our at-
tempt has begmfferely to restate and
keep alivathe debate as to the road to
socialist development for Namibia,
after indep@ndence. In view of the
debate raging in ‘sqcialist countries’
atthe moment, tothe eXtent that some
leading personalities argreported to
have questioned thg-fisdom of the
revolutions that toe place there at all,
as well as welebming extreme right
wing politiodl leaders toexpound their
joud philosophies to their people,
it is importanrtreverrmore so for usin
Namibia, toopen upas many areasas
possible for debate - now.

The Cubans and us

I WOULD like to share my views and
concerning the Cuban issue

RE

unlikely tosolve our problem, but more
attention should be given tosssisting
political and and other forms of strug-
ing against the regime.
According tothe current talks
South Africa and America introdaced
new issues in the matter and are try-
ing their best to switch the burden of
talks to the opposite parties - will
Angola accept all the SA. and
American demands? If yes, what will
happen to Angola next?
We rejected the connection of Cubans
to the independence of Namibia and

wore and are still demanding the

withdrawal of the S.A. troops and ita il-
legal regime from Namibia, but not
one of either parties (South Africa or
America) is willing to listen to us as
they are in favour of war. South Africa
staysin Walvis Bay even after UNSCR
435 is implemented - what then?

We are intimidated by the SA.
regime with its apartheid laws and
military atrocities. It is preaching its
“goodness” to win the hearts and
minds of the people, but we suffered for
a long time under its colonial regime.
It is still continuing to minimize our
political rights - how will we continue
with talks?

Cubans were willing to help Angola
from the intimidation we expenencing
here and their presence in Angola is
legal. As long as the intimidation to
the Namibian people continues
Angola cannot be saved.

Those who are threatened by the
presence of Cubans in Angola are the
“Terreblanche group’ of the South
African regime, who want to exploit
the Angolan people and its allies. Once
the Cubans withdraw from Angola the
‘“Terreblanche speech” in the past few
days will be manifested practically.

The Namibian people welcome the
Cubans, because they are comrades -
they don't kill, but save. We have ex-
perienced SA (not Cuban) atrocities;
and the Angolans too.
