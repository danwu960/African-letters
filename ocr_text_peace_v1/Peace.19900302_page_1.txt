The chief's motives

WHILE 1 support all efforts of

Swapol and wish them immediate
success in apprehending the perpe-
trators of the recent murders in
Owambo and Groorfontein areas, and
that the culprits are brought to book
for their dastardly deeds, 1 could not
conrprehend the motives behind Chicf
Kuaimo Riruako’s press conference
as reported in The Namibian of Feb-
ruary 21.
might take the law into their own
hands and accused other political
partics in this country of alleged fail-
ure in condemning the recent killing
of three white residents of Grootfon-
tem. He further wondered why the
murders had occurred after the adop-
ton of the constitution of the Repub-
lic of Namibia.

Chief Riruako seemed to be out of
wach with events in Namibia. The
killing of irmocent people has been
common and prevalent, especially in
the north all along since the election.
Many people were robbed af gun-
point of their properties and animals
and people killed in the process.

These incidents were reported ‘in
bocal newspepers and to my know!-
@dge both the Administrator Gen-
@ral, who is charged with maintain-
ing law and order and different per-

lies including the Constituent As-
sembly, expressed concem and called
on the law enforcement agency 10 do
uncir level best to bring the culprits to
book and to end the lawless situation.

However, Chief Riruako, who wants
“peace to be maintained for all, not
for particular people or particular
Organisations’ was in this country
and never called a press conference
to denounce killings, armed robbery
etc in the north part of our country,
bui anly when they happened in Groot-
fontein. What hypocrisy on the part
of he DTA President!

In the spirit of national reconcili-
ation, the sput of Namibia demands
that we build a nation hand in hand,
irrespective of colour, race, religion
or ethnic, regional or party affili-
ations.

Lastly, Chief Riruako accused
Swapo and the AG who “‘had put
Swapo in the position of government
before Swapo had officially been

inaugurated as the new government!
It 1s not Swapo or the AG which had
pul Swapo in government. Swapo
was elected, and the AQ, as the rep-
resentative of the colonial regime,
would be the last person to put the
movement in government.

Chief Riruako must know that itis
the people of this country who hate
colonialism and sec their salvation in
Swapo that put Swapo in govern-
ment. Itis the likes of Chief Riruako
who voted for the loser party - the

DTA, who do not make any differ-
ence.
