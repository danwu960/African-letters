To the dissidents.

AN open letter to Nanso diasiderits:
I (Katjiua, Rukoro, Makari, Zauana,

Karamata, Tjimune and Siririka):

I would like to reply to your long letter
which appeared in The Namibian of
July 15 in which you shamelessly
revealed your anti-Swapo sentiments
(or fears of Swapo).

lam responding to your letter in my
capacity asaSwapo member andl am
in no way stating Swapo's policy on
political rivals, however, I believe that
the overwhelming majority of Swapo
supporters would agree with me.

No doubt you belong to the ethnic
party which is trying to unfairly be
called an equal of Swapo inthe libera-
tion struggle. I myself, initially, and
until very recently, wrongly believed
that Swapo should join hands with
what is referred to (sometimes wrong:
ly) progressive groupings against the
common enemy.

But after your letter and your party
Secretary General’s (properly termed)
‘thinly-veiled attack on Swapo at
Okahandja, I have changed my mind
and suggest that this idea be
relinquished.

You mentioned in your letter that
students who are not Swapo members
eg. Damara Council and Swanu ‘P, |
would be alienated by the political and
ideological direction N anso ann
ring ‘one again to wo Nanco paiey
