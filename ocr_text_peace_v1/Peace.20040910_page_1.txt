The People Must Nominate

AS a peace loving Na-
mibian, | would like to
give MY Opinion ON OUT
democracy.

I would tke to start
with giving my advice and
Views to our democrau-
cally elected representa-
lives those are voting to
be nominated and those
who are representing us
now, more especially
members of parhament
(National Assembly and
National Council). Some
of our representatives do
not truly represent us.
because we, cilizens often

do not nomunate them in
the urst place. They are
representing thetr respec-
tive political party leader-
ship. Representatives who
have been sonominated by
their leaders, once elected
to office as parhamen-
tarians and councillors,
become subservient to
these leaders. Instead of
this representative being
accountable to the voters
they are only responsible
and accountable to their
political leaders who nom-
mated them. and who also
have the power lo remove

them. Therefore such
representauves Strive to
please their leaders often
iN patron-chent relation:
ships. Such relationships
are often maintained atthe
expense of the voters and
the general public. This ts
why once in their office,
most parliamentarians
and councillors may not
do what the public expects
them to do.

I know that these rep-
resentauves are not really
representing us because
cilizens are not the ones
who nominate them,

awe AlCl Ss Oe a Law

What! want toemphasis
is that: P can see that the
top-down appointment
of candidates is not a
vood way to go. Voters

have to nominate their

own representatives. Such
representauves nominated
by the voters themselves
know the needs of citi-
gens better than imposed
candidates do. Voters also
nominate a person who
they know and who they
trust. This system of the
top-down tashion of nomi-
nation must be stopped
and bottom- up fashion
must be introduced in the
political parties. | know
if we do this, our country

ye eet mM

Will be a good example to
other countries. Further-
more OUF representauves
will be accountable to all
ciuzens. The representa-
tives nominated by voters
themselves will work in
the interest of their voters
and not in interest of their
political leaders. because
they know that Hf they
do not work in the inter-
est of their voters in the
next election they wall be
kicked out. | wrote this
letter because | know that
we as ciuzens really need
to be represented.
