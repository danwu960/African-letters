Brother vs brother

[TIS sad w learn that fellow
Namibians have engaged in brutal
activities against their own brothers
and sisters. ] am talking about the
campaign which is being carried out
by DTA thugs against the freedom-
loving people of Namibia.

Why is it that DTA supporters
have taken a step of this nature while
at the same time they arc talking
abou: democracy? As far as most
Namibians are concemed, the DTA
never supported the war against South
Afnica or said a word against the SA
colonialists.

Now the nationis wating for free
and fair clections which will lead the
country to independence, the [) TA
has begun to wage war’ We have
pointed out several wines chat wc
harbour no hostility agaimst our
Namibian brothers and sisters. the
struggle has been and sullis agaist
colonialism and oppression

Why is it that the DTA is ‘coura.
geous’ enough to fight agamst Swapo,
but not against colonialism?

We believe that we are onc people
and the same family of Namibia's
children. We have no reason to fight
against our brothers, and we have
extended the hand of peace and rec-
onciliation to unite the people of this
nation and to bring the counry to

ce.

The DTA is being used by the
South African regime to cause chaos
and create a situation conducive for
civil war, after which they can inter-
vene.

Even the Bible says if someone
slaps your cheek, then tum the other
cheek, but what happens if they slap
that one as well? I am sure that the
answer would be to retaliate in self
defence.

The DTA must know that Swapo

is not afraid of them, but is
avoiding them because we want peace
and freedom. We do not want war.
Let us go to the ballot box in adecent
manners; let us make Namibia a para-
