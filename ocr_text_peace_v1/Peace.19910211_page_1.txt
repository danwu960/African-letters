Nurses on lunch

advisable for nurses to go on
lunch on a shift system.

hope that the Ministry of Health
and Social Services will look
into the matter and recommend
a change.

to discos or any other night

enjoy themselves because the
owners of these weapons might |
harm, kill or disturb people
while enjoying eee party. y
Windhoek especially, many
peo,le are threatened by the |
notorious ‘Red Eye Gang’. They
cannot move freely after sun-

“being robbed, harmed or killed
