Now we kre women in peace.
| Let ya have ourchance to fulfil
our ‘nepirations to help our

‘cotintry to emerge from the
‘darkness’ of , inequal-
ity and grinding poverty. The
dreams of a Nanubia
will be doomed in the absence
of women's participation. On
top of that, the idea that all
people, the youth, the women
and the elderly should be in-
volved in the development
process isan extremely impor-
{amt one, particularly af this
time when Namibia needs to
marshall all its available re-
sources for development. Ef-
fective utilisation of human
resources at all levels and all
dimensions, is key to the pro-
motion of real development in
Namibia.

The time has come that a
change of attitude must take
place. Women have now for
some time realised that we have
the potential (social, economic
and political) and wisdom to
shape the future of this coun-
try. We therefore nghtfully

demand the opportunity to have |

this vajuable potential fully

tapped fur the development of |

Namibia. Machinery to enable
women of Namubia to fully
participate in the development
of our motherland must be put
in place.

Women’s participation will
change society and liberate
women. Women's struggic
must not be seen in one dimen-
gion, as simply a struggic against
men. See the many aspects of
the structural dimension (so-
cial, political, cultural and
economic).

Struggle means awareness.
Struggle means organisation
and unity. Struggle means
courage, struggle means faith
and hope. We must begin to
build these up in our small
circles and link up with one
another. Nobody can help in
this process more than women
ourselves, Let us mobilise and
organise ourselves for cystem-
atic involvement in change. Let
‘us support ourse} ves in organi-
sing at the workplace, at home
and in society.
