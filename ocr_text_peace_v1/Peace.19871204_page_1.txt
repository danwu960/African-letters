PEAS 18: i les, letter tomy fellow
compatriot - conscientious objector - Dr
Ivan Toms.

Ivan, you goon trial on November 30
for refusing to serve in the South
African Defence Force. This you do for
many a legitimate reason, least of
which is because you believe that asa
person who regards himself as a
patriotic South African, you must stay
and contribute in the borad-based
struggle for a free, non-racial,
democratic Republic of South Africa.
For this I salute you in your selfless
commitment and your courage.

The victimisation and suffering you
have endured so far has been harsh.
Nevertheless I trust you will continue
to stand by your conscience, and even
at the cost of further victimisation,
continue to actively identify with op-
pressed South Africans who- black and
non-black, because they were born in-
to repression or because they, like you,
have refused to repress - have been
harassed, tortured, banned, detained,
imprisoned, banished, exiled and
murdered.

Your loving care and concern - as
demonstrated in your willingness to be
put on trial - in defence of our
Motherland in agony, will help enrich
her soil so that one day-she may be
allowed to bear fruit which she will
share among ail her children.

Further, I would like to appeal to all
those compatriots who are in self.
imposed exile ... if after serious re-
thinking - in the fact of what stands i.e.
sacrifices lvan and other compatriots
have made - you still fee] you cannot
join them then please, at the very least,
join a progressive organisation in your
adopted country supporting us back
home. It is because our nation needs ac-

_tivesupporters- and not ag shamesym-
pathstic bystanders-that people, like
Ivan, make these commitments.
