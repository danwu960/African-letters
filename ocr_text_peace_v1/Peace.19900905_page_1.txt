Thanks to Angola

DEAR friends from Angola

Ii has taken me quite a long tame to
think of how to thank you for the
good things you have done for Namibia
. the list of all your assistance 18 too
long to include here.

How do I thank someone who has
shared a trench with me? T have no
descriptive words lo express my
gratitude and appreciation for what
Angola has done for Namibia. [ know
that the pce Angola has paid for our
independence is higher and I am sure
that it cannot be measured in either
gold or money. The people of Angola
and their socio-economic infrastruc-
lures were the daily largets of the
apartheid regime and its mercenar-
1€5,

However, today we are the victors!
The precious blood of the Namibian
and Angolan daughters and sons has
crowned our struggle with freedom
and justice. I am aware of Te fact
that our enemies are still vArking
(lay and night to destabilise our peace,
happiness and fratemal comradeship
and, therefore, there is still aneed for
vigilance at all times.

Tbelieve that Angola and Namibia
can work together in order to bring
peace and stability to our beautiful
region of southern Africa.

1 would like also to thank my friends
and comrades in Angola, especially
those who shared trenches with the
Plan combatants in the juat struggle

against colonialism and all forms of

‘ Oppressionin Namibia. [particularly
want to thank the President of the
People's Republic of Angola and the
MPLA, His Excellency, Jose Edu-
ardo dos Santos and the entire leador-
ship of the MPLA.

n the same vein, I would like
thank my colleagues of the IMPLA
who assisted me and my comrades of
the Swapo Youth League on numer.
cus occasions. Porhapa it is unfair to
