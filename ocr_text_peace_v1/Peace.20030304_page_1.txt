Happy About Fourth Term Cam

THE lingering debate and pos-
tunng by politcal pundits, tra-
ditional leadership, the ordi-

nary ciuzens and ‘outsiders’
about the need or not for Presi-
dent Nujomato run for another
term, the so called ‘Fourth
Term’ as Head of State, can be
likened to a rhinoceros, which
looks different depending on
where the observer is standing
and what portion of its anatomy
he/she 1s concentrating on.
Each perspecuve has some Par-
ucular insights andeachis only
a part of the whole!

As an ordinary Namibian
ciazen from the Caprivi Re-
gion, I am therefore delighted
to hear of yet another concerted
and well-orchestrated cam-
Paign to convince and/or urge
our President to seek another
term.

There 1s an American Say-
ing, “ifitain’tbroken, don't fix
10". My position is simple and
gRoes something like thts: the
inconclusive leadership transt-
tion (no domestic pun intended
since mostof the senior leaders
in the Party and Government
are seasoned, tested and com-
Petent) that the recently held
Swapo Congress Produced,
raises important questions
about who will really be in
command should President
Nujoma step down after the
expiry of his current term.

While Iam a Breat believer
In ‘collective leadership’ (it’s
casy if you are one of the cho-
sen ones), I suppose I’ve be-
come disillusioned with poli-
tics - and I think most
Namibians have become disil-
lusioned with poliucians too.

An intellectual friend of
mine once commented,
“Namibians don't want to ac.
cepl excuses any more - if
there’s moncy tobe stolen, why
isn’t there money for the peo-
ple?” It would appear we sull
don't have our pnorities nghte.

Once upon a time I was al-
ways fixing everyone else's
problems, but not my own and
guess where it landed me?
What has all this to do with the
Fourth Term, you may ask?

Despite a mosaic of tnbula-
uons and misplaced pnonities,
every day I ask the question:
‘Can President Sam Nujoma
do no wrong?” The answer is
an emphatic NO.

Namibians love him above
all other Ministers and even
the feeble and weak Opposi-
tion grudgingly admires his

Poltucal talent. At his age,
President Nuyoma has lostnone
of his charisma he had in exile
and ts a man of al} Seasons
liked by all Namuibians from
any comer of this great nation
of ours.

Perhaps the Breatest asset
credited to President Nuyoma
IS ZOOd governance.

Since independence on 21
March 1990 delivered high lev-
els of security, provided qual-
ity educaton and health serv.
Ices, respected political
freedoms and human nghts,
framed a strong rule of law,
bolstered an economic frame-
work conducive to growth and
has provided an environment
in which civil society can flour-
ish.

Hence, there 1s a direct cor-
relauon between good national

bovernance and economic
Prospenty

Ordinary Namibians havea
mght to expect a better life af-
ter all the sacnfices they en-
dured during the liberation
struggle. People do not fight
for ideas but for peace, mate-
nal benefits anda better future
for their children.

The majority of Namibians’
€xpectauons of independence,
namely, their sincere hope that
freedom from colonial Tule
would usher in a new era of
basic rights and freedoms long
denied by settler rule. This 1s
What the liberation struggle
meant for ordinary Namibians.
President Sam Nujomais there-
fore an embodiment of the
aforementioned ideals.

The big question for Pres-
dent Nujyoma, therefore, is not

paign

as much opposition from ann-
chair critics from the West,
amateur poliucians of ‘op
SIUON parties’ but the envy of
his own colleagues, some of
whom have bowed out due to
their politcal naivete.

President Nuyoma has one
Tule he says something each
day and in such a manner that
it becomes the talk of the na-
tion He 1s therefore in the Spor-
light most of the ume - all of
which impresses the Namibian
voters and makes his fellow
politicians seethe with jeal-
ousy

How detilitaung then tocnt-
ics with hidden agendas, that it
1s President Nujoma who 15
getting the good headlines.
