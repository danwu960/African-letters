The time for talk about unity is
long overdue. It is now time to act
unity. It is time to involve all the
Namibians in the unity of purpose
process.

The masses must ask their leaders
to unite them for the sake of our in-
dependence and beloved fatherland.
We should not give the enemy the
chance of further dividing our
already divided people. The enemy
did it by creating eleven ethnic
governments. He did it by buying
and bribing some of our people. He
did it by his political ideology - ter.
ming some of us terrorists and com.
munists. He ts still doing it with his
radio and TV broadcasts. Finally he
is doing it by taking some black
money: mongerers into towns to
create a black middle class-cum-elite.
The irony is that these blacks think
they are destroying apartheid. The
truth is that they are being used to
strengthen apartheid.

Multiracialism and liberalism have
never been the friends of those under
oppression. All these terms tend to
create divisions in the liberation
movement and some confused blacks
tend to think that by associating with
whites, they are better than other
blacks. History has proved that white
liberalism is an enemy of the strug.
gle for freedom. Whites cannot
enslave us and at the same time
claim to be our liberators. Freedom
is not a gift, its a victory, and that
victory will only be achieved by the
blacks themselves. History has pro-
ved that whites in the ranks of the
liberation movement tend to be spies
and informers. Whites tend to be in
control or to contro! whether they are
in the majority or minority.
Wherever the whites went, they went
to control.

Socialism is the basis of the African
culture and also part of the African
revial and struggle to regain the lost
glory and freedom. Socialism is a way
of life for the African and not a
foreign, imported ideology as claim-
ed by white capitalism. Blacks own.
ed everything commonly, even the
moet powerful kings did not claim or
own private land or waterholes.
Socialism should not only be preach-
ed, but practiced ... in fact it should
be lived. We as socialists should put
the example of being true socialists.
We should stop living as capitalists
