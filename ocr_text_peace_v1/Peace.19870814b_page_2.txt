vehicles to drive safely. :
one thing that really surprised me
isthat there are more thana thousand
old houses. Some uf them are in the pro-
cess of falling down. The local
authorities nave plastered and painted
oniv 700fthem, and have pros ided the
materials for 40 hirers to de tne Joh
themselves. The rest of the pecpie qave
been told thereis not enough money for
the project and that the rent would
-hen increase by R5 or more. Present
rentals are R25 for a four-roomed
house: R20 for three rooms; and two
rooms. R15 a month. Many of the
renters are jobless men and women
and pensioners.

The local authorities mention in
their most recent report this year that
everything is going well in Otavi.
What they should know is that
everything is going well with the
whites there.
