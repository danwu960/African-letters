On Radio Owambo

I WOULD like to express my views
regarding the socalled Owambo an-

nouncers in the services of the

SWABCâ€™s Radio Owambo service. |

..L] These announcers are blinded and
misled by South Africa not to see the
realitiesoftheconditionsin Namibia.
They are used as instruments by SA to
promote its interests andcolonialism
in Namibia.
_] They represent a Corporation
(SWABC) which is parastatal and fur.
thers the ethnic dispensation in
Namibia.
\! They are used to broadcast the
deaths of freedom fighters in such a
way that it causes panic, wrath and
hatred amongthe peace-loving Nami-
bians. They appear to keep silent on
the deaths in units such as SA DF,
SWATF and Koevoet. Furthermore
they urge people to believe the latter
suffer no casualties.
i: Female announcersare guilty ofthe
same things.
i. Most of these announcers have
become resident in the towns of
Oshakati and Ondangua and hardly
visit their places or origin. They are
fully disconnected from the nation. If
they are on a reporting mission, then
they are given an army escort.
[| They are used to promote the in.
terests of multinational corporations
in Namibia, by urging people to buy
their products such as liquor and
cigarettes, but neglect to urge the na-
tion regarding education, health and
agriculture.
) Prominent occurrences of national!
interest are never broadcast by this
service. Acts of repression and brutali-
ty by the security forces in Namibia are
never broadcast.
[1 They are used to promote the ac-
tivities of SADF, SWATF Etango in
northern Namibia, and perhaps they
are even members of some of these
organisations.
(| They are always pro-Unita, inva-
sions into Angola, Renamoin Mozam-
bique, and are anti-East (USSR and
alles), anti-African, and oppased to
leaders such as Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, Peter Kalangula and Justus
Garoeb.
