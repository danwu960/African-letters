woe A Call To Action

Ss you

for an| THE world climate is a volatile one as we rapidly
ysolve | approach a future of uncertainty in world politics.
yan by | Because of the recent violence abroad concocted in the
*k for- | war waged against Iraq, just like other countries it is
d your | time for Namibians to organise visible resistance to
you be | this war and all forces that are threatening the peace of

vation | a world we have responsibility to.
tion of | This is acall to action for Namibians. A broad base of

support must be gathered out of the Namibian commu-
nity, and it will take the work of cach and every
Namibian to get this off the ground. We need a broad
enced | base support that honours each person's unique com-

urag- | in, and stand strong.
We will need a variety of assets to make this work.

y,the | Fromschoolteachers to workers and artists, to students
ejoy| and organisers, we must realise the urgency of this
your] situation and the deep necessity to resist.
not This movement must be sustainable, and therefore
|his| we must do it well with high energy and undying
year | commitment. Even after the bombing stops in Iraq, the
violent crisis will not be over, and the nature of war is
hes | that the aftermath effects everyone. War perpetuates
de-| and amplifies already dire situations like starvation,
we | sanctions, community destruction, continued tension
in| and loss of live. These are only a few casualties of war.
as No country, including Namibia, will go unaffected
| economically, socially and politically by the war in
a Iraq. We must organise each other to participate in the

I worldwide effort to handle the aftermath an’ be Pop
f! future violence. Fellow Namibians, us get on board
d and fight hard for a just peace bere and throughout the

world!
