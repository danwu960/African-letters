Give Peace A Chance

AS we all Know the US and its assoct
ates are prepay for the larzest and
most expensive offensive which the
world has cver witnessed. Phis often:
sive ds aimed avast the vulnerable pe
the children and other mnocent sieuims
while the main culprits are at large as
usual Phe US hunt tor Bin Laden has
proven unsuccessful so far
I don’ tcondone terronsm or any other
associated barhane act against the mno-
cent. Neither should chaos be the order of
the day in apprehending those suspects
We are inaciilized world where the mule
of law is preserved. Thats why we have
a recoznised body (UN) which 15 sup-
posed to ensure that peace and tranqu)l-
lity prevails on this planet. and among
others to sancuon any military acuon

ull the end of the year. If the US 1s really
concemed about the situauon why not
cooperate with the arms inspectors by
providing them with exact details of the
alleged weapons. These arms inspector
can then take the appropriate steps as
mandated in their mission. This wall
make the task easier for them. Why
would you waste billions and billions
and behave like an unruly kid by taking
the law into your own hands? C'mon,

give peace a chance.
