Were The Elections Free And Fair?

ELECTIONS would be fairif those who vote elected
their representatives freely without any pressure or
any form of intimidation or character assassination?
I strongly feel that (the Swapo Congress) elections
were not free and fair.

The sacking ofoursistonary, capable Hamutenya
just before elections and smear campatens against
him by Nujoma on several occasions will never
make this election free and fair.

I would notexpect any rational person to belies ¢
what has been said about Hamutenya by those who
did so, including the President.

We expected the President to tell the natlon and
the Congress in particular that these are tested
comrades and the every body should make his/her
own choice accordingly.

He ts now claiming that the Congress has voted
in the interest of the whole nation. This ts totally
wrong. The congress has voted for Nujoma’s un-
Known interests.

If the entire nation was afforded a chance to
elect, | think the results could have been different.
The fact that Pohamba came with a pre-prepared
speech for the victory shows us that the results
were predetermined and the transparency used in
the counting processes is questionable.

We considered Sam Nujyomaas the greatfounding
father of our natron and indeed a visionary leader

of Africa but this was not so. Nujoma ts increas-
inely becoming a hardcore despot. He thinks he can
turn things around, ceteris paribus. Firing senior
ministers and indeed cabinet members who served
for decades ts a big embarrassment to him and to
the public.

Does this mean Swapo party does not have iter
nal disciplinary procedures to deal with unfounded
defaming allegations’? He keeps on referring to
others as imperiatists and forgets that he went to
the same imperialists to negotiate for Namibia's
independence.

His prerogative is beigg seriously misused. Some
ministers are so much preferred that firing them
would destabilise the country’s peace and stabilits
and dissolve the gains of our hard-won mdepend-
ence. This is also a sign that Swapo ts slowly but
surely disintegrating.

I think this was the wrong decision at the wrong
time. All the peace loving Namibians (perhaps ex-
cluding despots, opportunists, presidential remote
controls, political armatures, and power-hungry
hereby sympathise with Hamutens aand his deputy
We are already missing his intellectual leadership
which we always admired.
