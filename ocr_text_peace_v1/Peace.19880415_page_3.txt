On Carti. .

In short, politics is not foreign to
members of the Church. To be a
member of the Church does not extract
any one person from being a human be-
ing with human needs. Therefore, the
Church as comprised of people cannot
be accused of mixing with politics un-
til a normal political atmosphere is
restored - when threat to human lives
and properties ceases and safety and
security, is guaranteed by a proper
judicial system and humane, accep-
table protection of human rights.

Again, these are just opening
remarks. | am expecting a response.
Especially from those who feel this is
a scandal both to their Christian or
otherwise understanding of the
Church and political analysis.
Remember also that we do not speak
about a theocratic state here since this

is not our vision in an independent
Namibia. I have deliberately scratch-
ed the surface. Let us ponder together
over this issue of church and politica in
our abnorma!] Namibian society today.
