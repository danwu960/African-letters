| at do youleave behind for your
children? Ina nutshell, a country
identified by crime, markexl by crimi-
nals, shadowed by house breakings
and robberies, and eventually deaths
It all rest on our Shoulders of moth-
ers, fathers, politicians, churches,
schools, government inter alia.

What can you do ty prevent this

from happening? The need for effec-
tive active action arises. We need to
integrate, and work together as a so-
ciety, put our differences aside and
think about the children of tomor-
rOW, Of are you selfish of j
enough not to think of the children of
today? We need to “act” before the
shadow is cast over us all, and then
there will be no tomorrow for usor the
children.
