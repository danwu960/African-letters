filtration. But we, the parents, found
out that you took them beyond our nor-
thern border, about 200 kilometres in-
side Angola. |

Why did you do that while you knew
very well that Angola is a free and in-
dependent country which has never
threatened Namibia?

Also be honest and tell us now what
you actually want in the Peopleâ€™s
Republic of Angola.

Are you not satisfied with the
unlawfull and illega) detention, the
rape, the killing of innocent Nami-
bians and the destruction of their land
and property?

What else do you want? What other
sacrifices are to be made by the African
people, whose only desire is freedom
and justice? -

We, the parents of those serving in
101 Battalion are now tired of mourn-
ing for our dead sons who you, South
Africa, took to Mavinga. We are also

tired of yourempty and false promises
of compensation. :
Just pack up and leave Namibiansin
peace,

PARENTS
NORTHERN NAMIBIA.
