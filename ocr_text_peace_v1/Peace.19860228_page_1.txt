Preserving the
status quo

THERE CAN BE nopretense. There
can be no cover up. Nfoses Kat-
jiuonguatsacollaborator Hers not
only a member of the MPC,
machinery set up by the South
Afncan Government, the most ar-
ticulate member of a Cabinet pro-
tected by the South Africanarmy and
its secret services, buthe also prevents
neople trom peacefully registermy
their reycction of South African col:
omahism and oppression,

Al a tecent press conterence he
said ‘to wive peopic trecdom iy notte
givethem licence to turn against ihe
State. These fateful words ts ample
prool, not only of the extent and
depth of his collaboration, but the
fact that he is no nabionalist but a
mere reactionary.

However devious his rhetors, his
capability to ‘capture the imagina-
tion of the majority of the popula-
tion’ has been reduced 10 zero if it
ever existed at all. For to be a trend

ofthe stateisto bea frend oft tvran-
ny, brutality, violence, oppression
and similar vices.

The fact that the South Afneanr
rulein this country 1s legal, her in-
struments, the Administrator
General, armed forces and national
assembly must also be without
legitimacy

Nonetheless, Mr Katyluongua sees
It fil tO State that ‘we must be seen to
be doing the work we said we would
do for the people of this counuy, and
we must justify taxpayers money’. He
even finds it necessary to altempt the
propaganda that ‘the transitional
government has committed itself to

changing the country to make! bet-
ter for its people’

The laws that Moses Katjiuongua
holds are the laws that virtually the
whole Namibian population has
dismissed as oppressive and immoral
and have fought since the orjgin of
our political struggle and earlier

Surely political stability means
preservation of the status quo. Any
change brought about by the Cabinet
will be of the type that fits wath the
grand designs and strategies of South
Africa to retain control of our land
and its resources.

Katjiuongua deprives peace:
joving men and women to make their
grievances heard in a peaceiul way
“nd asks these people to surrender
(heir genuine aspirations for justice,
peace and freedom ib favour of
douile acceptance al laws winch are
an anathema to them wilerest wd
welibeme.

In vase the highl. cducated
Cabinet member does not khmow rt,
peacefulcampaiensand oii! unrest
are not the same thing.
