a Unite!
DEAREST fellow coutrymen and
women, ] urge you to unite and Support
your movement Swapo to the fullest ex.
tent, no matter what the enemy ofour
people may think.

This moment isathresholdtothe im-
plementation of Resolution 435 and
subsequently to the independence of
our country. Namibiana, like any other
nation, must show their unity, to fight
hard inorder toeliminate colonialism‘
and slavery as well as racial
discrimination and exploitation of
man by man in our land. Our people
should be on the look-out for the
enemy s tactics of disuniting us.

We must stand firm on our way to
freedom without wavering, We do not
have tolet ourselves be stoopes where
the enemy of our people can use us to
fight against our own people and
freedom of our country.

The racist government has so many

plans and tricks for destabilisation.
We must be prepared to defend our
would be sovereignty and hard-won
independence. We must not allow
banditry to take place in our free
Namibia.
We must be prepared to develop our
country in order to have enough food
for our people, enough shelters and
good communication systems
throughout the land. Peace must
prevail in our land after our
independence. 7

We have to live together aschildren
of this beloved land Namibia. We must
also be prepared for hard moments
ahead of us. The racists in Pretoria
have never been honest and cannot be
trusted. We have seen the horrors they
are Causing inour country until today.

Many lives have been lost, many peo-
ple have gone missing without trace,

many families have become childless
and many children have become or-
phans. All such horrific and barbaric
acts are committed by the raciats and
their followers. ,
Beloved nation, we have ian ished
for too long in the hands of apartheid |
and colonialiam, so let us break the |
barriorsoftribaliemandregionaliam. | —
