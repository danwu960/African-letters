It is very dehumanising
and an unbelievable situ-
ation to always see the he-
roes and heroines of our
country running round the
streets of Windhoek and
other major cities without
work, when in practice the
position which they rightly
deserve and are qualified to
do are being occupied by
foreigners.

Practically speaking, the
labour situation in an inde-
pendent Republic of Na-
mibia shows that, cowards
who fought in defence of
injustice and colonialism are
today the people enjoying
the fruits of braveness.

Apart from those who have
sacrificed their lives for
national independence,
democracy and justice to
prevail, we have the limp-
ing injured ones who today,

. | because of the war for na-

. | tional independence and
democracy, have lost some

. | parts of their bodies.

f The obvious questions

)

l

which suggest themselves
include whose responsibil-
ity it is to succour these
brave sons and daughters
and whether there is any
mechanism in place to en-
able them to enjoy the fruits
of their bravery.

There are many answers
to these two questions: some
of today’s politicians are of
the opinion that it is Swapo’s
| duty to look after the brave
_ | -sons and daughters and give
| them essential facilities.

On the other side of the
coin, some intellectuals are
of the opinion that they
should be looked after by

. | their families.

All in all, both answers
| are baseless and do not suit
| or fit into present political
| reality. |
