Ndemufao, King Nehale
Mpingana, Jacob Mar-

Frankie Fredericks and
others asked whether
German Govemor Leut-
wein should be a hero,
Or President Sam
Nujoma?

AS far as I am con-
cerned this question still
needs an answer.

Before this issue was
debated 1] had already
some interest in the topic
and was trying to gather
information for an edu-
cation poster on heroes
of Namibia, which is still
pending, as the question
remains unresolved.

As a histonan | was
asked to idenufy Namib- '
ian heroes, and the aim ,
of the posters to help or
guide teachers at schools
as to how they could
include this topic in their
syliabus.

Generally a hero ts a
person distinguished by
his or her extraordinary
courage or strength. -

In my opinion Namib-
ian heroes are those who
