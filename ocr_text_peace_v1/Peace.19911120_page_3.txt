What I said in my speech,
which I had stated on many
occasions before, is that if
Namibian democracy 1s not
assisted with sustained and
substantial economic and fi-
nancial aid, there is a likel1-
hood that Swapo's traditional]
constituencies such as the un-
ions, youth and ex-combatants
will become disenchanted with
the Government. The gap in
social dispanties rather than
narrowing would continue
widening. In a nutshell, while
our democracy is functioning
and growing, it still remains a
fragile expenment.

Democracy and development
go hand-in-hand, but the nec-
essary pre-condition a country
must have is a situation of peace
and stability. This we have in
Namibia, and the Govemmment
is determined to carry on with
development efforts on this
basis.

I was talking about what could
happen, and not what is hap-
