‘White’ peace

1 DIRECT this letter to all black
‘makakunyas’ throughout
Namibia. In everyday propaganda
they are made out to be angels who
tell us that ‘we will win and Swapo
will soon die’.

Are these men South Africans or
Namibians? And why do Nami-
bians join these troublemakers and
delayers of independence?

PLAN says it aims to free
Namibia. What are the aims of the
‘makakunyas’? Are they trying to
protect the status quo?

You are turned by the whites in-
to a ‘good fighting machine’, but
don’t you realise you are killing
your own nation? a

Why are white families living in
peace in their towns? Is it because
they are recognised as masters of
this country? Why are black
brothers not in the same position?

Is the status quo not brought —
about by apartheid?
‘Makakunyas’, you are fighting for
neo-colonialism.
