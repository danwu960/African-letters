similar people.

To conchude my letter I would
like to call upon the local people
to assist the police in getting
_ rid of these people and having
these elements arrested. I hope
that the police will take the
matter one step further and
outlaw the carrying of knives
and pangas.

We are children of the new
Republic of Namibia and we
want to live in peace. I do not
agree that Namubians should
tolerate these cnmecs and al- Â©
low them to continue.
