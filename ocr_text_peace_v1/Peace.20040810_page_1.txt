Namibia Is A Gem

PAM ane vperenced worldwide tray cller
and visited Namibra for the fourth ume
this July together withims husband and
vo children. My conclusion is simple
Namibraisagem..comparedeven with
South Africa det me tell you why:

Upon arrival at the airport we meet
friendiy immigration officrals who
made usteclreatly welcome im Namibia
onither then looking nasty as gs the case
IN MANY Counts.

The small but cosy airport rmimedi-
ately wives a feeling of bering athome.
Government offterals. mmuigration
staff and customs alike all are very
professional and frendly.  f believe
these people should Know thrs and be
encouraged to keep at that way!) To-
vether with our two children we found
travelling extremely easy and secure. All
the way Lexpenenced proper Telecom
mifrastructure, roads and nice people.
Phere are many enticisms of the park
stalhol btosha. sorry Edidaâ€˜t tind those
untriendly peopte.

So Namibtans be proud vou have a
gem in your hands and make sure you
Keep itand develop it wath a smile.

Another example of where the public
administration does wellis the Windhoek
veneral post office. the stall was most
helptuland trends to help me weth our
sons stamp collection

Why | did write fo Vour new spaperas
vou probably Know atl this? barst there
Im concern thabyouare notaware that
vou are dome well

Crities Tike bo cite recent anticdes like

those published i Der Spregel to warn
everyone that the country rs in trouble...
Second there is a warning: fam scared
that Namibia changes its lovely attitude
and becomes mvolved tn issues Ike
those in Zimbabwe.

This would kill the atmosphere and
tourism with il You need to ensure con-
unued safety: Phere rs nothing you want
more on holiday than peace of mind.

lalwaysteltsafe compared to Belgrum
whichis NOT the casein RSAand NOT
atallin Zimbabwe),

That feeling of safety is a result of
haw people reactin Windhoek up to the
remotest corners of Damaraland.

Something additional to mention ts
medical back up and police safety: you
have a medical evacuation system fike
international SOS .

Make sure these people are well
Known and can do ther work atall mes
For toursts Knowing that there ts such
support in case the worst happens tsa
must...to be a destenated destnauion in
the world.

It doesnt stop with being evacuated
quickly you also need good medical ta
cutties. Py istied Medichinre in Windhook
and was impressed by the taciities and
proper care. Hi Twas the government |
would cnstire that pris ate rmitatuy es such
as Medichime and SOS vet all support
to be able to Mourtsh andotter medical
back Jup in case
