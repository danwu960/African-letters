You can become involved at all lev-
els, and it is important everywhere. It
is necessary in our daily relations
with other people.

Talk about fears and negative
expectations, but also understand and
share the anticipated joy of many
Namibians about an independent
Namibia.

- Great challenges lie ahead for all
- professionals and experts to contnib-
ute to the development of Namibia.
Ever so often economical questions
are being discussed during which
businessmen just shrug their shoul-
ders or show their dismay. These
economists too, are challenged to
accept the realities. Contribute, by
sharing your knowledge and expen-
ence, to the formulation of a new
economic policy.

-: ~The times of ‘‘alles-sal-regkom"’
are past. We need creativily and
imagination, idealism and visions for
the shaping of a future Namibia. So
offer your expertise and positive
involvement NOW!
