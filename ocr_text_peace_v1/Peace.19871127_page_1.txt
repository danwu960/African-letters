We won’t forget

ALLOW me to compliment the ‘just’
comrades in exile; particularly the
leader of the liberation struggle, Mr
Sam Nujoma and his offspring. I wish
them all a happy Christmas and pro-
sperous New Year.

We in the interior of Namibia won't
forget you; even some of those whose
minds are clogged with money and are
still collaborating with the SA occupa-
tion forces. We don’t follow the coward-
ly campaign and love of money of those
who regard themselves as South
African mercenaries.

We must re-dedicate our lives to our
country. Daily we are praying for those
in exile and for our Namibia tobe free.
That is why we say we won't forget, and
you are repeatedly in our memories.

To those whoare killed, maltreated
and detained: Jesus wassimilarly tor-
tured and killed for usto live. To those
in exile: one day we will be happy
together in an independent Namibia. |

Racial discrimination, apartheid,
detention without trial, exploitation
and all colonial actions, will be forgot-
ten by all Namibians who love peace
and stability. No Namibian will be in
exile as is the case at present.
Remember ya Toivo’s remarks: “The
liberation struggleia long andbitter”.
