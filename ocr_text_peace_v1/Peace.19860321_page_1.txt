Women and youth exhorted to unite against apartheid

AS WE usher in this year of peace
and harmony, Swapo must assist the
women to take an active robe in the
polltical Hfe of our country. Nocoun-
try in which women do not have
equality with men, can be truly
democratic.

Women ofourcountry andallthe

Our people are the masters of their

own lives, designers of their own
future, and dictators of their own
destiny. The illegal rule in Namibia
nvist be brought to an immediate
end.

No government can continue to
impose its rule coercively in the face
of the conscious defiance of the over-
whelming majonty of its people.

Women of Namibia! The hour has
passed when women were made to be
mere spectators of events. Your
husbands are not paid adequate
wages. Your children are walking
around with empty stomachs and
they do nol receive a proper educa-
Lon. Thes are taught in segregated
schools and you do not have decent

Thase who proclaim power do not

ciuzens of today and tomorrow and
the salt of this nation. [tisto vou we

resolutely. Stand up for justice to

prevail in Namibia.

Remember apastheid is like cancer
in the body politic of the country. It
is repugnant with the symptoms of
hatred, fear and relentless violence.

To draw up a corstitution at this
juncture without the participation of
allthe parts concerned, is fraudulent
and an indignity -o our very ex-
istence. Regard it ay null and void

Tre State President of South
Africa isnot sincere it las proposal
ror the implementation of Resolu-
tion $38. and he has ne right to link
the independence of Namibia with
the withdrawal of the Cubans from
Angola.

The Cubans are in Angola at the
invilation of the Angolan Govern-

ment, and ever since they went to that
country in 1975 to date, they havenot
attempted to violate the territorial
boundaries of Namibia or South
Afnca.

}see no logic in the proposal of the
State President. One would have ex-
pected Mr Botha to be more realistic
and practicai on this desperate issue
of Namibia. Anissue which took so
many vears ta discuss inthe tnterna-
ional forum.

Anyvola is a sovereign member
state or ine Lomired Nations and
under the preseni Charter of the
tCinticd NaGeors, No government or
imdividual has rhe rhe co impose
dictates on thal ecvernment,

IP W Bouha. asthe leader of South
Africa. can only hate the Cubans
withdrawn from Angola through
peavelul negotiations and not
critical and empty proposals based
on malicious intrigues.
