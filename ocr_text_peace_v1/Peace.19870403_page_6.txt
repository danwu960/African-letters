No, Ms Lister, we champion peace. We
serve the Lord, and we will continuetofight
and to get politics out of the churches and
churches out of politics. We are proud of
what we are doing. We are not hyprocrites
- we live in accordance with our convictions.
We need nothing and nobody to dictate to us
what we may or may not do. We have the
Lord on our side. We know that we are
fighting a justifiable and virtuous conflict
in striving for peace and Christian charity
and to attain independence wherein a
democratic dispensation will prevail, giv-
ing everybody the right to be free to live his
or her life without interference from
distorted power-mongers

CHRISTIAN ACTION
WINDHOEK

NOTE: Unfortunately of the four
signatures ontheletter(with the excep-
tion of those of Col Desmond Radmore
and Mr George Yates) two are in-
decipherable, so the public is as much
in the dark as ever about socalled
‘Christian Action’. Neither did the
lengthy missive serve to shed more light
on this mysterious organisation. It con-
sists primarily of waffling on your part,
Colonel Radmore, and references toor-
dained priests as ‘socalled clergymen’
shows that you yourself are involved in
senseless mud-slinging and politicking
on behalf of certain instances. You may
well serve the Lord, but you serve the
SADF as well, and the First Command-
mentis ‘Thou Shalt Not Kill’ In previous
correspondence of your organisation,
you also claim that you are able to |
monitor the comings and goings of
clergymen at military bases, which
would seem to indicate you convenient
ly use your SADF affiliation in your

‘Christian Action’ propaganda.

Presumably also, in “fighting to get
politics out of the churches and the
churches out of politics” you target the
Dutch Reformed Church as well as the
Council of Churches groupings. But I
doubt that. Yours is a highly selective
morality.

sional journalism: don't presume to tell
