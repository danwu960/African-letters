Peace miles away

THE tong yearned-for Namibian
after more than 70
years of South African rule, is clearly
visible. But prospects toward a lJast-
ing peace m a future independent
Namibia, and the entire region of
southern Africa, is still miles away.
There are two major areas of concem
- the status of Walvis Bay and the
Angolan war.

Walvis Bay, Namibia's only deep
ocean-gomg port, poses a single major
threat to any post-independent gov-
emment in Namibia as long as South
Afnca continues its claim over the
port. Despite the United Nations rul-
ing that Walvis Bay is an intcgral
part of Namibia, Pretona continues
to regard and treat the nortas part and
parcel of South Afric}.

Walvis Bay is not only a vital
anchorage for imports and exports,
but provides a large military basc
and airstnp for South Afnca to con-
tinue its destabilising tactics against
the neighbounng black African states.
This will enable South Africatokcep
war away from its mainland. No
county has so far dared to launch a
direct attack on the South African
mainland while South Africa has used
illegally occupied Namubia as a spring-
board for its periodic incursions into
southem Angola.

Walvis Bay has even greater im-
plications in terms of its relationship
to a fubure independent Namibia. Since
the port is part of South Afnica, those
Namubians residing in Swakopmund
and elsewhere will need to have visas
to leave and enter the port. And a
horde of Walvis Bay residents em-
ployed at the Rossing Uranium Lid,
outside Swakopmund, will have to
periodically renew their visas to en-
ter and leave the port on their way to
and from work.

Also, the SA officials travelling by
road to Walvis will need to apply for
visas to leave and enter Namibian
territory. Walvis Bay also stands as a
potential cover for any opponents of
a new Namibian government, and
might as well provide for their base.

And the fact that Pretoria and its

nrogates might use Walvis Bay as
sagt for m sack on th
Namibian heardand in the event of 2
x dispuls, remains a subject af
