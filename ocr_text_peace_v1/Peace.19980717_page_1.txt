She wentan to wnte that [11s tot enough for Pohamba
to use coercive tac bes by re munching Swapo members that
the decision of the Congress is banding and that none dare
change their minds” 1s this really not a plac desptay of
white liberal arrogance and prepadsce artvanced into a
hogh degree of dysphaece sod political dysphoria. is
freedom of the press in this country meant for arbitrary
media power abusc”

Does Lister ceally imply that there are some Swapo
MPs in Parliament who are not free to arbculzte thes
feclings openly and who. if given a secret chance, will jou
the ranks of the opposition members m Parliament to
undermine on rejoct party resolusons they have formu-
Iated in panty structures to which they belong? One
compelica to enquire if apostasy is a
crvouraged in any situation?

Lister's accusation against Mr Pohemba on the therd
lerm exposed her as a heartless and shameless poliucal
demagoguc

In many cases, 1 reflects vivedty well om Liser’s
openions thal according to her will everythang dermocrat-
cally decided in Swapo should not be regarded as having
been decided democratically as long 25 tes 206 in line with
her interests. She appears to be ruled by passion other than
reason because of her habenual bemoaning and berating
the Swapo Party in general and the Swapo Party leades-
ship in particular on decssons taken by the party Organs
