-—6hr?>On ‘Bothacracy’

IN RESPONSE to Mr Veripi Mungun-
da’sidle talksin The Namibian of Ju-
ly 10 on the topic ‘Coward Lister’, |
would like to point out the following:
1. Lister - nationality and
patriotism: | feel it is Ms Lister's full
right to express herself against the in-
justices and brutalities conducted
against the Namibian national, ir-
respective of where she was born. She
isa more credible Namibianthan you,
who are selling out your nation, your
country and its natural resources. She
paystaxesasal] Namibiansdo andin
addition, contributes actively to bring:
ing about of peace and stability to
Namibia, while vou keep yourself
tribalistic and passive. Beloved Lister,
keep on, every good work deserves a
reward.

ty: OPO has not existed for along time.

ple’s Organisation, Swapoof Namibia.
for along time. How dare youcall it an
Ovambo party, although itis a Nami.
bian national political movement?
3.CCN - priesta, puppets Shame on
you, Mungunda. These people repre-
sent the Namibian nation (the Coun.
cilof Churchesin Namibia). They are
renowned for fighting for peace, yustice
and liberty, and committing
themselves tothe spiritual carv of al]
Christians.
4.Swapo generals- where are they?
Swapo has been willing to sign an ar-
mistice with the Pretoria regime and
latter has failed to agree to it. And now,
Mr Mungunda? Swapo did not glorify
war, but was forced to take up arms
against those you praise.
5. NCU - ao truly Christian body
Could atruly Christian body request
the dismantliny of its own nation’s
refugee camps? Camps where Chris.
tian Namibians reside? Who do they
think will house Namibians fleeing
from the racial laws inthiscountry? Do
they think it iseasy tostay outside the
country without proper supervision
and do they think it is easy to provide
such supervision there?
I finally wish tocondemn Veripiand
his puppet structure for:
C: claiming that apartheid Jaws are
dead in Namibia;
[- requesting pre-independence
development aid and recognition of the
interim government internationally;
— supporting the unelected,

unrepresentative socalled interim
government;
"_ affilhating toan ethnic-based party
such as Nudo,
. legitimising SA's presence in
Namubia by being part of reactionary
forces such 4s Etango, Swapol, Swat.

l also condemn the interim povern.
ment for their ‘secret services’ and pro
paganda of indoctrination and
discrediting Swaps wth our tax
monies. They urve Prevoria’s furces to
‘exterminate Svwapy und ‘hit them
harder’ which outomatically causes
people to leave the country.

e¢ have never been deceived by

Vorster’s regime nor will we be deceiv-
ed by Bothacracy. Remember that,
Veripi.
