Colonel Eimbeck reacts to opinions of Pastor Kameeta

YOU HAVE GIVEN Vice Bishop
Kamecta space in your newspaper to
volce his opinion. I request thesame
Opportunity since you call yourself
achamplon for freedom of speech.

Mr Kameceta claims that the in-
dependence of Namibia is an in-
alienable right, and that itisdemand-
ed without conditions attached. He
iscight, but why does he, and his par-
ty, Swapo, refuse to acknowledge any
other political opinion in this de-
mand for independence?

Why doesn't Mr Kameeta use his
high office to ensure justice, peace
and freedom for eery Namibian?
He is aware of the fact that Swapo
does not tolerate opposition. He
knows that everybody opposing
Swapo will be subject to arbitrary
punishment or even execution
without a fair trial. Mr Kameeta
should support the call made by The
Namibian on Swapotoensurea fair
hearing for those who are accused of
being spies for South Africa.

Mr Kameeta should be aware of
the fact that many political parties in
Nainibia have urged Swapoto be an
equal partner in their opposition to
South Africa. He should also know
that Swapo refuses to drop the adjec-

tive ‘sole and authentic represen.

tative of the people of Namibia’. Ms
Lister should inform Mr Kameeta of
what her experiences are concerning
this imposed status on Swapo. Mr
Kameeta, who has vowed to preach
love, peace and righteousness,
should be inthe front to ensure that
every Namibia be granted the right
andthe opportunity to work towards
independence of this country.

Mr Kameeta knows that Swapo
regards violence as the only viable
means of allaining independence tor
Namibia, but does he consider the
fact that the majority people in this
country are peaceloving Christians
and thus prefer a negotiated
settlement?

Mr Kamecta calls for boycotts and
disinvestment and calls the potential
suffering of the majority of people
‘empty phrases’. Simullaneously this
Vice Bishop demands that ‘all peo-
ple must have the right to decent
housing, and bring up their families
incomfort and secunty. Free medica!
care and hospitalisation must be pro-
vided for all, with special care for

senior citizens, mothers and small
children. The aged and disabled must
be fully cared for by the State’,

Has it occurred to Mr Kameeta
that foreign investment is vital to
achieve these aims” Mr Kameeta ts
fully aware of the fact that Swapo
and the CCN regularly call on inter-
national financial support to
alleviate the plight of the people.
Why then should only his party and
is followers benefit from financial
aid and not the majority of the
people?

Will Mr Kameeta care to tell the
public how much he earns and how
much he pays i taxes? Will Mr
Kamecta be prepared to inform the
people of this country about the
lifestyle of those who profess to fight
tor independence and liberation
about ther contribution towards the
alleviation of the suffering peaplein
the form of financial contributions?

Can Mr Kamectainform the publicof

whathe proposes shauld be done to
obtain sufficient funds to attain what
all the people in Namibia desire?
Mr contention is that Swapo is
guilty of the most atrocious
discrimination against people. Mr
Kameeta is actively engaged in
Swapo's political activities, this
inakes him guilty of discriminating
against his own people too, Accor-

ding to the Oxford dictionary,
discrimination means to ‘make a
distinction, to give unfair treatment,
especially because of prejudice’.
Swapo and Mr Kameeta call
everybody who does not comply with
their conditions and with their opi-
mons, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pels etc. Everybody who dares to
speak against Swapo is threatened
and intimidated. Every person who
does not support Swapo is being
discriminated against. This ts
definitely not what the majority of
Namibians will support: this is what
the majority ofthe Namubians want
eradicated,

Mr Kameecta claims his fame and
right to speak about political matters
on his attest and detention. For any
law-abiding citizen, especially for
devoted Christians, defiance of the
lawis detestable. If Mr Kamectaasa
Vice Bishop and even more as a
Swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
ahenable right to self-determination,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not suppartan
organisation which sees only
violence as a moans of achieving

what they desire, namely, to take over
power of this country.
Mr Nujoma has declared more

than once that Swapo is not in-
\erested in powersharing, but onlyin
power itself, During his recent pro-
paganda tour for Swapo in West Ger-
many, Mr Kameeta has proven that
heis against any form of opposition
to Swapo and that he disputes the
right of freedom of speech of a Ger-
man citizen in his own country. With

this act added to his political antics

against the people of this country, Mr

Kameeta has disqualified himselfof
claiming to be a champion for
freedom, justice and peace.
