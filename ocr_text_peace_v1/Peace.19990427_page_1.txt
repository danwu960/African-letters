Allow me therefore to express my opinion on
the latest voting in the UN Security Council
where only China and Namibia opposed the
punishment by Nato of Rump Yugoslavia for
committing crimes against innocent civilians in
Kosovo and refusing to sign the peace agreement

A decision to vote against It is made oo the grow

the struggle for our independence. I would like to
know what sort of belp we are talking about and by

members of the European Union on whom we
depend so much in terms of investment.

This can also mean more unemployment and
