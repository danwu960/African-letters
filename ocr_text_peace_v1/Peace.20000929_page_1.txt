Kavango A Living Hey

1 AM a Kavanyo student
based in Windhock and
would like to express my
concern about the ongoing
banditry activities in my
region. I have seen that the
crists situation in the
Kavangois going from bad
to worsc.

Government's reaction
towards this problem ts a
complete nddle to me.
What is the use of just sit-
ting in luxurious offices,
peacefully and quietly,
while life is really a living
hell in the Kavango. The
Government should rather
find a solution to this mat-
ter, instead of just saying it
is the people of the
Kavango themselves who
are collaborating with
Unita.

Let’s come to a reason-

-able solution - instead of

wasting our tme on re-

aa _ ~

eruminauions against cach
other. This situauon where
Kavangos cannot even
enjoy the basic pleasure of
peace, progress, prosper-
ity and stability should not
conunue like this. [feel we
need the total deportation
ot the MPLA from Nami-
bian soil. Zambia has done
it, Why not Namibia too?
One thing the Govern-
ment should be aware of is
that Unita’s banditry ac-
vities are always onCNN
and this will discourage
More tounsts trom com-
ing to Namibia. So we will
lose anyway, as our coun-
try’s economy depends on
tounsm and this is reason
enough for foreign busi-
ness people not to invest
their shares in Namibia,
especially the Kavango.
Some of the schools in
the Kavango, like Max

Makushe Secondary
School, fans Shastipapa
and others won't have
physical science or math-
ematcs teachers. The yol-
unteer teachers won't be
interested in applying to
these schools due to the
unstable situation in the
Kavanyvo. In this way the
economy and academe
issucs will vradually be
aftected ;

So the Government
should not yust stand by.
must do someting - de-
mand the total withdrawal
of the MPLA trom the
Kavaneo

Unita bandutry activities
should not only be

Kavangoconcems, butthe

whole of Namibia as ‘one

Nanubia, one nation’.
