theak the Losd for the peace he has
‘brought to our country eo far.

Moet of us who fought against onc
another are now united as brothers
and sisters in one single and mighty
Defence Force. We thank the Presi-
dent of the Republic of Namibia,
Comrade Sam Shafishuna Nujonu,
for his policy of reconciliation and
nation-building.

- Weasex fighters are also commit-

tod to reconciliation and nation build-
ing. We respect this Government as
well as the constitution and laws of
the land.

‘We also want to contnbute to-
wards nation-building, although cer-
tain problems have cropped up.

Some of our families and even ex-
fighters in the rural areas of the north
are threatened by certain undisci-
plined Swapo elements. Let me state
clearly that they are not Plan fight-
ers. There isa very good understand-
ing among us as former fighters.

We as ex-fighters can defend our-
selves if necessary but we want peace.
This is the reason why many of our
fellow fighters left for South Afnca
because they want to live in peace
and harmony, and they believe they
can get it there. We could also join
then: but we want to remain in Nannbu.
This is our country and we are proud
sons and daughters of Namibia.

With the war in the past which was
mostly ran by the whites, there is
nobody pointing a finger at them.
While they live in peace in our be-
loved Namibia, we are being dis-
crimuinated against.

We do not want reconciliation to
collapse and we are fully aware of the
faults of the past, but we are appeal-
ing to responsible Namibians to take
this matter seriously.

We former soldiors also want to be
treated as human beings. Namibia is
still e young country, 90 let us all join
bands nd build a new Namibia to

‘show the world what true democracy
mesna - and our children will be
proud of what has been achieved.

We are all hoping to celebration
the first annivoreary of independ-
.eage on Masoh 21 next year without

qonflict,

and stay sober. We Paso hapa" to
convinces our fellow brothers and sisters
who left the country to return to their
motherland.

Let us all enter the Christmas sea-
son with poaceful bearts. Long live
the people of Namibia and its Presi-
dent. May God give him the wisdom
to rule the nation.
