What’s In

A Name’?

ALLOW me to space
to talk about an issue
which | think destroys
Namibia’s national
unity and needs to be

cleared.

It’s 14 years after tnde-
pendence, which means
14 years of reconcilta-
tion and unity, but there
are still a majority of
Namibians referring
to northern regions as
Ovamboland.

This needs to be ad-
dressed and eradicated
by our leaders with the
powers that are invested
inthem throughelecting
them to lead us in peace
and unity.

Thanks to all the lead-
ers for pondering my
requesl.
