Taken aback

I AM taken aback when I think
of the socalled peaceful, but
violent Mafwe protest against
B A Sinvula, the newly-ap-
pointed Education Director in
the region.

The Mafwe group seem to
lack discipline, sense and
understanding. It appears to
me that the protest was backed

by Muyongo’s DTA. The same

group are accused of dismiss-
ing Albert Buchane who was
the Ngambcla of the group.
The dismissal was based on
the reason that he received an
invitation from Swapo.

the time for colonialism, which
was their bread and butter, is
now dead and buned. Educa-

young men are tailing over the
posts because of their educa-
tional qualifications. The ap-
pointments were ministerially
approved and not just because
the Mafwe wanted it, as was
the case in the past.
perform such stupid activities.
Muyango must please stop, and
tell the people to come back to
normal. A lot of the allega-
tions by the Mafwe against the
