Colonising ourself

ALLOW me toair my opinion that we
the Namibians, are guilty of colonising
ourselves, especially in the far north
of Namibia.

Students who pass matric with good
symbols are unable to find jobs. Often
only those from rich families are con-
sidered, while those from poor families
are turned down. Employers
sometimes only give jobs to those well-
known names from rich families.

It happens in the hospitals as well.
On many occasions only those who are
well known inthe hospital circles can
be immediately hospitalised ifthey are
ill or sick, while many poor people
stand for a long time before they get
treated.

I wishtocall for anendtothis sort of
discrimination. Namibians should do
their duty as Namibians and imple-
ment equality among themselves in
order to achieve peace. Stop this man-
ner of colonising your own people.
