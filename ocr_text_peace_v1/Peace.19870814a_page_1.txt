Cry of the masses

THECRY ofthe Namibian masses has
gone up for the umpteenth time to
vanish into the annals of ignorance
and hatred.

The plea of my people for self-
determination and unobscured self.
rulehas been met with brutal assaults
by members of the notorious Koevoet
avainst those who dare to say it aloud.

So the war, waged in Namibia in
general andinthe north in particular,
has its effects on everyone not-
withstanding his political sympathies.

Those who withstand the war of
liberation are indoctrinated more tu
suppress and destruct. legally, in the
name of the colonial power and the
unelected elements of political
opportunists.
