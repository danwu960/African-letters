The people's leader

Who is the gemuine people's leadez/
Since the heyday of Pretoria's
regime in Namibia has left a dis-
graceful page in the Namibian his-
tory by dividmg the entire nation into
regional groups during its heavy
destruction and brutalization, peace-
thristy Namibian people have been
waiting for the truc leader to bring
about the total eradication of foreign
domination and oppression in their
only and one Namibia.

As the days of indeperdence ap-
proach, here cames the question; Who
is the genuine people's leader?

In order to avoid nco-colonialism
and corrupt leaders in the Namibian
history, the peace-thirsty Namibian
people with loyalty and fidelity en-
tus} the respected great leader presi-
<a Sam Naujoma, who heroically

succeeded in lead-
meterragte people of Namibia
in their Long and hot struggle against
the Pretoria racist regime and its

allies of the entire capitalist block for
almost 29 years. In this way, the
Tespected great leader President
Nujoma has achieved a great respect
among the Namibian people, as well
as internationally.

The Namibian people ecclaim the
SWAPO great leader president Sam
Nujoma as thei genuine people's
leader who will create the new state
of Namibia with prospenty, peace,
democracy, natonal security, justice
and social economics.

Therefore, the nanon is bemg called
upon to be vigilant and unite as one
nation to stand firmly against the
enemy's anticSWAPO psychologi-
ca] propaganda which is being pres-
enuy carried out by the so-called
security force so that they can mis-
lead the people from choosing their
genuine people's leader because they
are afraid of SWAPO'S inevitable
victory in the forthcoming elections.

In spite of the enemy propaganda,
1 am appealimg to the entire Namib-
ian nation foreach and every individ-
ual tocast his/her vote for SWAPO in

the forth coming ¢
enable the people’s organsation to
score more than the two-thirds ma-
jorty of the Namibian population so
that we can create anew Namibia in
which each and every Namibian citi-
zen will enjoy the fundamen] human
rights and lead a happy life free from
oppression, exploitation and injus-
uce under the leadership of the genu-
ine people's leader president Sam
Nujoma.

SWAPO is the people and the people
are SWAPO.

Ahtisaari has falled

Forces making for dividing the
Ahusaari, Magaret Thatcher, South
Africa, DTA, Koevoet and Action
Contra Res 435 have become forces
who want to divide the Namibians
for freedom, love, peace and unity.

Ahtsaari has failed in his mission,
like Dr Ercher, the Vice Sectetary
General of Kurt Waldheim m 1973.
Because the ends he served will take
him no further than himself.

It is SWAPO’s deep conviction
that ail the people wish to be free and
that their desire for freedom is rooted
