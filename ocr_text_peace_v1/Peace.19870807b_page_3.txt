â€™ Put Resolution 435 into operation
because we do not want colonization
and Dirk Mudge. Also we do not want
Shipanga and Katjioungua's talks. We
want the true leaders of this beloved
country. Mr P W Botha: take away your
destructive forces and leave Namibia,
we dont need you. We want peace and
equality for all and no discrimination.
