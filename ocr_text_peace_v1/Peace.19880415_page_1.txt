Church & politics

IS IT possible to talk about church and
politics at the same time? Do the two
have anything in common? Can the
church mix with politica? Such ques-
tions and more similar questions are
struggled with in the context of
Namibia in particular. Such questions
are both theological and political. For-
tunately, theological and political
questions are asked by human beings
who are involved either in the church
and/or politics in one way or another.

My aim here is to open up a
theolagical and political debate for
concerned people in a situation of apar-
theid, colonialism, racism, exploita-
tion and draconian lawssuch as those
of Namibia. I am stating only
preliminary remarks, sparing the rest
for contemplated responses.

The truth of the matter is that the
Church cannot claim its existence
without people Likewise politics can.
not be without people. It is the people
whoconstitute the church. it is the peo-
ple who politicise. The basic concern of
the church is wider and broader than
ity numerical membership. It is within
the framework of the Church's pro-
pheticcall and public responsibility to
aspire for peace, justice, freedom,
respect of human rights and dignity to
all people irrespective of their stations
in life. On the other hand, the Church
is not serving angels, but human be-
ings whose basic needs - among others
- include food, shelter, clothing and
security or safety. In essence, these |

needs cannot be secured without some
