Mortality formula

IN THE wake of the latest SADF incur-
sions into Angola and the claims by
Magnus Malan about Swapo's loss of

150mentotheir 12, onecould pose the

following questions:

C) Did Magnus Malan get his mortali-

ty formula from the now infamous

Voortrekker/Zulu war at Blood River?

O Ifthey (SADF)claim such a high suc-

cess rate, why then had Swaponot sur-

rendered during its first year of arm-

ed struggle (1966)?

0) Is Mr Malan’s cheap propaganda
aimed at those whoatill might join the
armed struggle? |

[] Hasheread the recent copies of The
Namibian which indicate a rise in ter-
rorist activities by SADF and their
_ offspring?

_ _Wecertainly don’t need your “protec-
tion”. Protection against whom?

Mr Malan, you might fool the pup-
pets you have installed here in Win-
dhoek, but certainly not the people of
Namibia whoseek peace and freedom.
