THERE are only « few days
left before we celcbrate the
first anniversary of our hard-
won independence. It was 12
moaths ago when the popular
ruling party. Swapo, the then
Hberation movement which
gallantly fought and defeated
the then notorious forces of
occupation at the battlefront as
well as the ballot box, adopted
the policy of national recon-
ciliation, the policy of forgive-
ness and focus on the future.

First of all, let ue examine
the significance of March 21.
The date is and will remain an
illuminating day in the Na.
mibian calendar. Illuminating
in the sense that itis the day on
which the yoke of colomalism.
which was imposed on us, was
buried for ever.

It was the day on which
dignitaries from all over the
world joined the brave sons
and daughters of this country
to witness the burial of coloni-
alism by replacing the South
Afncan flag with that of the
new Republic of Namibia.

It was a wonderful and
moving occasion, which pres-
ent and future generations will
never forget. It was a day on
which the nationalist fighters
stood hand in hand and said
‘look, our sacrifices have not
been in vain’.

As the freedom fightars were
rejoicing, those who fought
against the emergence of
democracy stood with their
hands on their heads.

Why was it necessary to adopt
the policy of national recon-
ciliatian? The movement's aims
and objectives were to liberate
this coumtry from the then forces
of colonial oppression and
establish a government founded
upon the will and participation
of the Namibian people.
uns achioved that, the

-——

colonial regime with the view
of the achievement
of democracy. With this in mind,
Swapo opted for a policy of
national reconciliation which
is humane and suitable for
Namibians.

The most striking aspect of
the policy is that it promotes
the values of equality and human
dignity. It intends to unite the
Namubian people irrespective
of colour, race, nationality or
ongin. This policy deserves
our respect.

Many have complained about

» the negative aspects of national

reconciliation but Little has been
heard about its ments

The success of the policy
depends on the performances
of those implementing it. The
ments of this policy are more
than its dements. This policy
is, in my view, meant to pro-
vide a breathing space for those
harbounng illusions about the
past colomal system to adjust
themselves to a new era of
national independence, peace,
stability and the humane ap-
proach.

As we rejoiced on March 21
last year, we were equally
womied about what we had
inhented from the then noton-
ous colonial regime in terms
of debt, unemployment and
pobtical instability (the latter
with regard to tendencies of
tnbalism and racial discnnu-
nation based on colour)

The probleniis, how are we
going lo pay the socalled debt
without economic prospenty,
and how are we going to com-
bat the already deteriorating
unemployment situation with-
out economic growth?

The government's efforts to
combat the unemployment
situation will be meaningless
unless accompanied dy the will
and voluntary participation of
the ‘haves’ of our society.

We expected the electranic
and print mediatoplay a major
role in shaping the destiny of
our people. But at the moment,
its efforts aro feeble because
we aro divided. We have just

emerged from s unique oolo-
nial system, a system in which

our people were taught to behave
in a tribalistic manner. This
evil sysiom has contaminated
the minds of some members of
our society, making it difficult
for them to adjust to the new
era of independence. The media
should be offering guidance to
our people to create for them
opportunities to rebuild their
self-respect, restore their faith
and rediscover for themselves
their human dignity. Regional
radio stations should be utl-
ised for the bene fil of people in
those regions.

Oue of the Government's
nian pnonties 1s education. It
1s the finest foundation of all
for the nation-building proc-
ess. Its also the comerstone
upon which 1a rest our surest
hopes to build our young Re-
public

As we approach the first
anniversary of independence,
we necd tn be devoted to the
cause of national building
through the process of national
reconciliation.

Fauure to implement this
posinvely will effect the con-
cept of democracy in this coun-
try.

We cannot achieve any of
these objectives unless we are
hardworking, disciplined, law-
abiding and unplement the
policy of national reconcili-
ation un 2 positive light.

thing about treatment in Vis,

When we talk about recon-
