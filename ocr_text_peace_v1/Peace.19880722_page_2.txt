and serve the interests of the rival
groups which failed to get political sup-
port in the national political market.

If vou want competition with Swapo,
the movement is not worried by that,
and will not participate in the competi-
tion because it is too busy with the
struggle for independence at this
critical stage. You have plenty of time
todothat, I guess. However your com-
petition will only be meaningful ifyou
join hands with South Africa and its
allies, but Swapo is determined to fight
South Africa and its allies at all costs.
You give the impression that you agree
with Mr P W Botha whosaid he would
not tolerate a Swapo government in
Windhoek. But I must remind you that
a Swapo government is inevitable
despite this remark by the South
African State President, because he is
in no position to prevent this and
neither are you. Would you opt for ban-
ditry (Unita style)? I would leave this
patriotic question to you and your
conscience.

In conclusion | would like to refer you
to what Mr Emil. Appolus had to say
when interviewed by Rajah Muna-
mava, and.I quote: ‘‘I am no great ad-
mirer of Swapo but it is a fact that on-
~ ly Swapo and South Africa can bring
about peace by signing a ceasefire.
Facts are facts’.

What a wise man at last!
