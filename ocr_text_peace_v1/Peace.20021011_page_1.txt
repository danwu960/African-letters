A Pain For The Youth

[ WILT. always be saluting the patron-
age of this widely read and informative
newspaper. The Nanubian newspaper
sull has the monopoly in terms of good
reporting both dunng the colonsal and
post colonial period - its still reporting
things as they are.

The aforementioned statement can-
not be defeated by any useful and re-
sponsible Nammbian citizen. The gov-
ermment does things without looking at
the mmpheations associated with its ac-
tions. One would always wonder 1f the
top government officials, including the
President, have advisors at all. Being

unemployed, we the youth of this nation
learnt with dismay of the government
ban from advertising inthe Namibran. It
Is very expensive for us Job seekers to
buy both the New Eraand The Namibran
at the same time. If the government 1s
shameful to come back to The Namibian
itmust establish a free of charge weekly
paper where we can get the govemment
job adverts. Otherwise there will be no
need to campaign for the next electcns
nor hark about peace and stahility.
