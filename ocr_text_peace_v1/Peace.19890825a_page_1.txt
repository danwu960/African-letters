On DTA tactics

IT is with anger and frustration that !
am writing this letter to the people's

For the past few weeks since the
election campaign went into top gear,
the DTA has embarked upon some un-
orthodox ways in its hopeless bid to try
and win potential voters in Katutura.
Every morning at 0S5h00 I have been
waking to a bizarre sound from the
DTA Nissan minibus which roams the
streets of Katutura endlessly.

This not only reflects the way in
which the DTA regards the people of
Katutura with contempt, ic. through
disturbing their rest and peace: but also
their inherent racist ideology. They
don’t go around like this in ‘white’
Windhoek. Because for them, those
people or residents need their rest
dearly, while the residents of Katutura
epparently don't.

This, I am sure many would agree,
does amount 10 psychological intimi-
dation and the sooner we see an end to
it, the better. I demand this as aresident
of Katutura who is affected by this
Corrupt practice. 1 am sure that this is

180 the demand of the majority of pa-
triotic residents,

DAVID IMBILI
