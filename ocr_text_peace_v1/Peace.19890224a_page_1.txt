Lost manhood
A WORD or two to all Namibi-
ans, black and white, who want
democracy and peace in this

To a large extent the evil-doers
have succeeded in producing, at
the output end of their machine, a
kind of black man who is man
only in form. This is the extent to
which the process of dehumanisa-
tion has advanced. The type of
black man we have today has lost
his manhood. In the privacy of
his ‘pondok’ his face twists in
silent condemnation of while
ari Li reagatsehy dag

ish obedience as he comes out
hurrying in response to his mas-
ter’s impation call. Sometimes
he joins the chorus that roundly
condemas the white masters, bul

shell: t0 infuse him with pride
and dignity: to remind him of his
complicity t in the crime of allow-

ing himself to be misused and
therefore letting evil reign su-
preme in the country of his birth.

This is what we mean by an in-
ward-looking process.

Brothers and sisters who are
still in the police force, security
forces and puppet government:
stop betraying your people. Our
mothers and fathers are the past;
we are the present, and our sons
and daughters the future.

gefitable that the administration

The Depdrument is divided into

Mafwé sections respectively, Dut
to mf suprise, I have found that
only Youth-frerrt we group
are, for the major part, mployed
every year, while we bia)
