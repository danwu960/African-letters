THEO-BEN GURIRAB
MINISTER, FOREIGN AF-
FAIRS

* Note: Other participants
at the seminar have indi-
cated that the substance of
our report on your speech
was correct, and the par-
ticular quote to which you
refer came at a point when
you diverted from your writ-
ten text. Your intention was
probably not to lump to-
gether the trade unions (and
Nanso which you mentioned
by name) and the right-wing
as respective ‘threats’ to the
Government, but a number
of participants (including
trade unionists) were an-
noyed by this reference. -
