Upset with Untag

I WISH to express my heartfelt
sadness at the irresponsible attitude
of Untag in Namibia from April 1.

I am disappointed in Untag in
general and Mr Martti Ahtisaari, for
their unwillingness to perform their
duties as expected of them by the
Namibian people.

On April 1, a peaceful march of
the Namibian workers under leader-
ship of NUNW was forcefully stopped
by colonial, heavily armed police in
the absence of Untag police who are

Supposed to accompany them. Thanks
lo the disciplined actions of the
workers themselves, injuries and
bloodshed was avoided since the
colonial police were under strict
command to act against the 15 0(XK)-
strong crowd if they proceeded with
the march to hand over a petition
protesting privatisation of public
property to Mr Louis Pienaar, the
Administrator General.

After the well-attended Swapo rally
in Windhock on April 1, Swapo
ricmbers and supporters on their
way back north were shot al by two
white vigilantes. Seven people were
Injured, two senously. When a local
pastor went to report the incident to
Untag personnel in Tsumeb, he found
the officer in an inebnated.

The most buming issue, which
forced me to write this Ictter, was
when civilians when to Untag per-
sonnel in Oshakati to repon heavy
fighting between Plan and the colo-
nial army, the two Malaysian mem-
bers of Untag took no notice and
went on rcading their novels. Some
of them were seen SIPping wine with
South Afncan soldiers at Ondangue
and Oshakau. |] am wondering whether
Uiese intemational peacemakers are
really serious about what they are
doing in Namibia. I am also sur.

_ prised that certain countries agree to
— contribute soldiers when they want
assurances of their safety.

} would also like toexpress myself

— on the decision by Mr Ahtisaari to
allow the notorious 10) and 202
battalions to be reactivated in order
to fight Swapo. Mr Ahtisuani's mis.
s10n Was to make peace but instead
he ugreed to the demands of the co-
lonial govemmor to allow the same
Broupa to go ahead and continue
doing what they have done for YCars,

Mr Ahtisaan, through his actions,
has lost the respect and sopularity he
has enjoyed since 1074

I call upon all progressive farces
Inside Namibia ww take united and
dechiive action. We should always
remember the inspiring words of
Swapo Prosident, Sam Nujoma, who
sald ‘‘we the Namibians, aro ow
own liberators'’.
