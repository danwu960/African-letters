On ‘Uninformed’ Opinions

IHOPEthistime my letter will ap-
pear, unlike the other vo or three
cases When you (unintentionally )
omitted them. Ewill copy itto the
other media, Just in Case.

I read the rather confusing, tf
not uninformed, opinion of Nadia
Ihuhua, where she was dissatis-
fied with Uutont Nujoma’s pres-
entation to the CHR in Geneva,
regarding the case of the Caprivi
secessionists.

Well, Nadia. like any other
Namubian, you have a right to air
your opinton as you did, so let me
do the same as follows:

How informed are you if you
label Cde. Paulus Kapia as one
of the “government officials”?
When last we checked Cde. Ka-
pia was a Party official. Nadia
rightly alluded to the need for us
to have “responsible and trans-
parent leaders who know what
isiMportantand what constitutes

human-centred

development” She ts right but
which humans are being referred
to? Tome. only leaders to the con-
trary will allow sucha vision to be
derailed by a tew elements

such as Muyongo and his
cohorts.

After all when we talk of hu-
man-centered development dont
we mean the people with a sense
of purpose, thatof sustainable de-
velopment, like the ones we have?
Or, Dowe mean the detractors, Ms
Ihuhua? Surely we do not mean
to spend all the scant resources
on the rights of the detractors
rather than on the pensions of our
elderly or HIV-AIDs patients?
Do you really think if we spend
millions of $ this case, we will
elevate our human rights record
internationally?

What about the right to five in
peace, the right to food. the right

live without fear ete? What Kind
of agenda do Vou sant to set for
US. Mnocent ciaizens?

Thenagain, since vou are Inv it
ing people to go to the launching
of the NSHR Report, then | guess
I(andevervone else} know where
you are coming from. Good luck
with thatevent, but for the rest of
us, We prefer democracy, which
is the government by the people
(majority ) for the people, and of
the people.

Ifyou really have the future of
our country at heart, please stop
bering phony and be a Namibian
The few people you are talking
about want their own country.

They will have therrfairchance
under our laws. The question is,
are they with Republic of Namibia
or with their dream Republic?
