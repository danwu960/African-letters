The ongoing crish, between Tag
n Sis een

the United States and Bntain is more Tie
a war show to some of us. If I can recall
correctly, in the 1990s we had what was
Called Operation Desert Seomm, the war
that was aimed at rag. Now again it
seems like we are again to see the second
pant of the operation, now being headed
by Bush Jr.

Bush Sr. headed the first part and now
we are again to see the other Bush tying
to continue where his father left off. Go-
ing to war_with Iraq will not be the
answer, it will only destabilize the peace
in the Muslim world. Is there any con-
crete proof that can implicate Saddam
Hussein in producing weapons of mass
destruction’ If there is not enough proof,
why is that the US is concerned with
going to war with Iraq?

I feel that we will pot be able to enjoy
peace even for one yeas, because the

Washington povemment will try to cre-
ate war whenever there is peace.
Is there not any single soluuon, which

can prevent the innocent people from
dying unnecessary deaths?

If the British government and the Wash-
can’t they try first to resolve the Middle‘
East crisis and then try to deal with Iraq?
What about the United Nations? Is not the
yob of the UN to see to i that no one can
be a threat to anyone? If we live in peace
and work for acommon goal, which 1s to
alleviate poverty and find the cure of
AIDS, wecan live better, instead of send-
ing millions of dollars in weapons, which
can destroy and kill people, we can use
that money to good use.

America will never get nd of its en-
emies, it must change its foreign policies
towards some countries. Change will be

better for everyone.
