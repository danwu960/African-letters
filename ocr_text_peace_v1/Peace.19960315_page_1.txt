“Truth Commission Not
The Right Solution ...’

1AM against the conference planned
for May this year by the Secretary
General of the Council of Churches
(CCN) the Rev Ngeno Nakhamela
about the detainees during the war and
the feedback given by the so-called
Executive Director of the Society for
Human Rights Mr Ya Nangolo.
These ideas must be stopped before
they re-open the wounds which have
just been treated by national recon-
ciliation.
fr —te

It things go on Ike this, let us put
reconcihation aside and start to tight,
because Mr Ya Nangolo always fights
people.

A psychological war is more pain-
ful than a war with guns.

Why can't we stay in peace rather
than fight each other.

Forgive and peace shall set us free.
