Goodwill to all

CHRISTMAS is a day of prayer,
peace and harmony. | want to call on
all Namibians to observe it as such
and to pray for peace and unity for
Namibia and people all over the
world.
Everyone should take time off to be
happy and enjoy the festive season.
i A great man was born on Christmas
Day, aman who brought freedom to
the world. Jesus Christ himself
wants to see a new Namibia born,
and its people living in peace.
