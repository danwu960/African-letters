posture of the organsof the UN whose
servant he is.

The authors would do well to
emulate Dr Perez de Cuellar’s honest
concern on these points instead of echo-
ing Swapo's hoary ploy of pointing to
“South African partiality” as a means
of diverting attention from them. All
thinking Namibians know by now that
South Africa - like any country - is
focuasing on the protection of its own
interests, not those of any Namibian
party. The recent contreternps between
the Administrator General and the
Cabinet following Mr Pienaar's
speech, serves to underline this.

The fact that South Africa's interesta
are not at stake here, probably explains
why that government formally aban.
doned its demand for UN impartial.
ty in August 1983. The fact that our in.
terests are at stake explains why
Namibian parties who do not enjoy the
benefits of UN bias, continue to make
this demand.

Why press for negotiation and
reconciliation before  in-
dependence? Because this is the on-
ly way in which political compromise,

peace, stability and a decent shot at
cconomic prosperity and national
reconstruction can be achieved in
Namibia.

The simple fact iathat negotiations
between Swapo and South Africa or
between other Namibian parties and
South Africa, will not achieve this. It
can only be achieved in negotiations
between Namibians capousing dif.
fereint views.

We understand why Swapo wishes to
Sign aceasefire agreement with South
Africa and why it does not. wish to
negotiate with other Namibian par.
ties. By signing a ceasfire with South
Africa, Swapo will guin prestige and
will be seen as the winner
