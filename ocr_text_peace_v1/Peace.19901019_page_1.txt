Std 8 impact

I WAS made to believe that there is
_ aconflict of interests in this country
— in the field of employment.

IT am saying this because previous
history shows that in the past job
apphcants were just taken in or
employed without pre-conditions. As
a result, there are many government
employees with less than Std 8 quali-
fications.

The buming issue today is the Std
8 certifitates and its impact on the
Namibian labour force. As we start
to reap the fruits of our country's
independence which we have fought
and died for, lying ahead is a politi-
cally-motivated blocking mechanism,
the Std 8 issue. Now, how can one
enjoy the fruits of hard-won inde-
pendence, if he/she does not possess
a Std 8 certificate?

Where do we go for a living, when
you are likely to face three questions:
Std 8 certificate; long-term job expe-
rience; and previous employer.

It is disappointing to have a door
closed in your face because you don't
have aSb& certificate. What about
those with practical expenence?

This is a disturbing issue. How do
they expect someone who was forced
to leave the country and fight to
liberate it, to surmount this blocking
mechanism?

The government of this oountry
inherited a large number of people

with long-term job experience. Why

— can’t they deputise these people with

_ lees eoxporicaced staff so that we can |

create mutual understanding and a
skilled labour force?

The Std 8 question is promoting
division between the haves and have
nots.

Iam thus suggesting to the law- :
makers that we get together and for-
mulate a 9ommon ma pou ne to how to
redress with rogers.
