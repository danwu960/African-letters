Sick of Bester

ALLOW me to express my heartfelt
disgust at Commandant G R C
Bester's childish, hopeless and self-
defeating comments which regularly
appear in this newspaper.

Asa patriotic and oppreesed Nami.
bian citizen, I really feel compelledto
respond to Commandant Bester’s
narrow-minded allegations against
the editor of this newspaper in par-
ticular and the entire oppressed but
fighting people of Namibia under the
leadership of Swapo.

I would like to make itcategorically
clear to Commandant Bester and his
masters in Pretoria that Swapo isthe
people of Namibia and the people are
Swapo. If South Africa is trying to
destroy Swapo, then they must be try-
ing to destroy the the suffering Nami-
bian people. But the apartheid regime
will not succeed in destroving the peo
ple’s movement. The apartheid govern
ment has been trying to bring Swapo
ta its knees for vears, but all therr ef-
forts were in vain

They have even tried to infiltrate the
organisation with spies, but none of
their dubious attempts have
succeeded.

Commandant Bester went on to ask
a foolsh and shortsighted question
“Who opted for revolution?” The
answer issimple and clear: Swapo. But
the next question to which he should
provide us witha proper answer is why
Swapo resorted to armed liberation
struggle.

Swapo Secretary General, Andimba
Toivo ya Toivo made the movement's
position clear in the Sixties: “Swapo
itself was a non-violent organisation.
but the South African government 13s
not truly interested in whether oppos!
tion is violent or non-violent. It does
not wish to hear any opposition to
apartheid”

Furthermore, Swapo President Sam
Nujoma. made clear the position of
Swapo with regard to the people's
revolution against colonial oppression
and exploitation at the WCC con.
ference in Lusaka last year. He said:

“On the question of violence, we make
no apology for the fact that afleracen-
tury of foreign oppression, genocidal
military campaigns and unbridled
economic exploitation, our movement
had decided totake up arms toconfront
colonial violence with armed self-
defence. It ig enshrined 1n our move-
mnent’s political programme that
Swapo does not glorify war We wish
that nobody hadever forced ustohave
to fight a war of national liberation

But the reality of prolonged colonial
oppression in Namibia being what it
is, we have been left wath no alter

nateve but to fight with armisin hand
for our liberty and right to self:
determination and independence To
those who would advise us not to fight
colonial oppression with armsin hand,
our answer is: ‘show us the available
non-violenl means to Namibia's rn

dependence and we shall fellow”

The available peaceful means to
Narnibian independence through UN
Resolution 435 has been deliberately
delayed by South Africa for ten years
Since 1981, the Swapo President has
expressed hia genuine willingness to
sign a ceasefire with the South African
regime any where in the world but in
Windhoek or Pretoria. But what was
the response of South Africa? They said
it was ‘premature’ to sign a ceasefire
with Swapo.

On socalled ‘atrocities’ allegedly
committed by Swapo against the
civilian population of this country, this
is wishful and baseless thinking on the
part of the people who have failed to

win the hearts and minds of the op-
pressed Namibians.

If Commandant Bester claims that
Swapo hag no support, then does he
think the over 3000 people whoattend
edthe recent Swapo public meeting in
Katutura were supporters of his
Government?

Commandant Bester cannot tell us
about the wavs and means as to how
Namibians should achieve freedom
and national independence, since the
whole history of the Afrikaners in
South Africa and Nannbia ig written
in blood How did they achieve their
self-determination from Britain?

Ithink itishigh trme Commandant
Bester stop writing rubbish to the peo-
ple’s newspaper and should rather
send his misleading and counter.
productive letters to the Koevoet
RKoerant

Lappeal to the editor not to publish
any more of his letters. He has access
toall necessary meansof propaganda
and should leave the-editor of this
newspaper and Dr A Shejavali of the
Council of Churches in peace.

t would like to close with the words
of va Toivo, whosaid that. “We believe
that South Afmea haga choice either
to live at peace with us or tosubdue us
by force. If you choose to crush us and
impose your willon us then you noton-
ly betray your trust, but you will live
in security for only so long as your
power is greater than ours. No South
Africa will live at peace in Namibia, for
each will know that hissecurity is bas-
ed on force, and that without force he
will face rejection by the people of
Namibia’.
