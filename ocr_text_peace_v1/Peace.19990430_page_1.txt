Where Are
We Headed?

PARKING a clove look at whatis happening tnour

region and in Namibia in particular as tar as lead
ership and polities are COM. crned, [ would The to

pornt our owe things that are increasimuds becom:
me a threat to our demowraes
POLERANCE - Namebrans have scen a show rny
number of cases where politicrans, espeetillys re the
ruliny party. have exhibited mtoleranee Pts hap:
pened after the launch of the new party aod there
Was namecalling, especially about Ben Ulensa
Launching a politreal party as in line with the
Namibran Constituuion and dees notin tring On ins
person or other partys mghtof existence
CENSORSHIP - Phe tact that State-owned me-
dia ure always reporting in tavour of Government
and the ruling party is a clear indication that there
isa vreat deal of censorship inthe media The state
is footing their bill, butas a taxpayer | want to be
ted with real, comect.and factual information und
news.
Hearing lines Ike ‘the Iegiumate government of
President Kabila’ on NBC makes me laugh. What
makes Kabila’s government a legitimate one? Is it

because it was brought to power through the barrel
ot a gun? [s it because Kabila overthrew a long time
dictator with the help of foreign troops? Is it be-
cause Kabila happens to be a personal friend of
some of our regional Ieaders? Would someone
please tell me how Kabila’s government got its le-

giamacy?

In conclusion, I hope that our democracy, peace

and stability, that we cherish and-enjoy, does not
go down the drain. Of course we can only accom-
plish this if we are all tolerant of one another as
countrymen and women irrespective of our pohtu-
cal differences and affilauon, colour, creed and

religion.
