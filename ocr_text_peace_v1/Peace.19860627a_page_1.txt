RETARY

ALLOW ME to express my views
on Messrs Andreas Shipanga,
Moses Katjiuongua, and Fanuel
Kozonguizi, about their positions
and what they are doing to the sul-
fering Namibian people.

As a brother and fellow coun-
tryman, I would be guilty if | did
not state my views in regard to your
present positions, labelled as
cabinet ministers by an unelected
interim government appointed by
the South African Government, be-
ing used as carriers of apartheid
and collaborators of the South
African Government; and being us-
ed to oppress the already oppress-
ed suffering Namibian people, your
own people, your own blood.

Did you know you are delaying
the country’s independence by
allowing yourselves to be used by
the South African Government
which is still exploiting our natural

civilian population. :

How did you feel at the. time,
giving approval to an army of
occupation?

Brothers, 1 want to remind you
that your forerunners, ard others
who have sold out to the enemy,
are forgotten, and were
like rotten fruit to the dustbin. You
should seriously reconsider your
positions in opposing your own
people.

You know you don’t have the
support of even two percent of the
Namibian people, so please open
the doors for Resolution 435 to
clect our leaders. We know them
well.

My message (Oo peace-loving
Namibians is that they should unite
and fight the darkness of evil
among us. Let us fight for our
future generations, and leave
money and cars to the sellouts.
