Constructive Idea

I AM writing to advise the
Ministry of Defence not to
misuse this time of peace.

Too much of a good thing is
monotonous. Soldiers in bases
around the country have no
work to do, except continuous
manocuvres and this brings
boredom.

On many occasions soldiers
are told to attend classes but
due to boredom they go absent
without leave.

My suggestion is that the
Ministry should take advan-
tage of this, and utilise the
soldiers in bases inthese times
of peace.

It would be better if the
Ministry could provide build-
ers to show soldiers how to
construct their own barracks
and provide them with bull-
dozers and tractors to lake part
in agneultural projects.

It we keep our soldiera busy
with productive tusks as wel!
as Constructive ones, this will
give us a good reputation with
the nation.

Soldiers need to be taught
skills so that they could join
workers’ brigades with better
qualifications whenever they
leave their posts,

The more they produce, the
more they will reserve; the more
they construct, the more: they
will protect; the harder they
