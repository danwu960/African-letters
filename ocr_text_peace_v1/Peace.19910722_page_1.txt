Business
as usual

ALLOW me to congratulate
the Cabinet of the Namibian
Government for its decision to
withdraw the licence of thee
Hotel Onduri in Outjo. This
was a much needed sign to all
racists that the status quo can-
not be allowed to continue.

The policy of national rec-
Onciliation has been abused time
and again by those who cannot
accept change and in fact are
still opposed to Namibia's
independence. Incidents of
racism frequently occur, espe-
cially in outlying areas, and in
my opinion the government has

_ been far too lenient in its ac-
tions thus far.

This encouraged the reac-
tionary forces to continue
‘business as usual’; workers
are still victimised tad exploited
while the ‘white’ privileges
remain untouched.

Social justice 1s a prerequi-
site for peace and democracy
and hopefully the Outjo deci-
sion will send a clear signal
that racism cannot be allowed
to continue. All incidents of |

racism should be dealt with in
the same consequent manner.
