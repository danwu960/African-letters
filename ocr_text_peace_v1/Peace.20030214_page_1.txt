WE read with shock and dismay the
artcle by the “brave” but nameless
‘Editorial staff members’ of Namibia
Today. This article is an unambiguous
declaranon of war by this newsletter
and I am ready to enter the battle
whatever the consequences.

The so-called wrong platform: The
Memonal service took place in the
Ephesians congregation of the Evan.
gelical Lutheran Church in the Repub-
lic of Namibia and for the information
of the "Editorial staff members’ | am
the Bishop of that Church. Thus, I
used my own platform.

The late comrade Hilukilwa
Kandanga was a member of my
Church. She was not only a heroine,
but also a true Namibian who did not
only condemn tnbalism with her words

bot also very much with ber ows life.

Therefore, the timing of what I said
was correct, and within the right con-
text. It is also obvious that I woald not
ask permission from Namibia Today,
of anyone clse, for what I said on my
own platform!

My so-called attach on Swapo: At
no stage dunng my serman did I men-
uon the Swapo party or any tibe. I was
also not exclusive in what I said, but
very inclusive. I called on all of us, the
former oppressed Namibians, to also
look at ourselves and to correct whatis
wrong with us. The ‘editorial staff
members” accuse me of lies but they
are Shameless when they fabricate what
I did not say.

Minister and his Excellency the Presi-

All three of us condemned tribalism
and cormupton in public and pot be-
hind closed doors “at the nght place,
and had it handled in line with the
culture and long established practice
of debate and mature discussions that
prevails in the Swapo party”.

Does this by implication mean that
the statements of the President and
Prime Minister on these issues are
outbursts and tibal antics and are also
regarded by Namibia Today as outra-
geous, despicable, and wild? This is
indeed the conclusion of all nght-think-
