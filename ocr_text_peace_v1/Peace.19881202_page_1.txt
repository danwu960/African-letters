Freedom charter

FIRSTLY, we the people of Namibia
declare for all our country and the
world to know that Namibia belongs
to all who live in it, black and white.

The main demands are: the people
shall govern; all national groups have
equal rights and should unite; the land
shall be shared among those who work
for it; all shall be equal before the law;
all shall enjoy equal human rights;
there shall be work and security; the
doors of learning and culture shall be
opened; there shall be houses, securi-
ty and comfort; there shall be peace
and friendship. Justice shall be the key
of all activities.

Finally, let all who love the people
and their country now say, as we say
here: the freedom we will fight for, side
by side, throughout our lives, until we
have won our final liberty.
