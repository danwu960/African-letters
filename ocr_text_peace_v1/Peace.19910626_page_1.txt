DTA in Opuwo

WE Opuwo inhabitants are sick
and tired of the megaphone of
the DTA which makes unnec-
easary nase, both day and night.

We have a secondary school
here and our students are busy
with exams. We also have a
hospital where our patients are
lying trying to get rest while
they get treatment. We work-
ers of the Government also
need our rest after a long day's
work.

Bet DTA members appar-
entity don Yt think sbout the future
leaders of tomorrow, or their
studies. They don't respect the

ick and they don’t care for the
workers. .

We are appealing to the DTA
to stop these activities and give
us some peace to build our
young Namibia. Forward with
developroent.

Water tartffs

IWQOLD like to air my views
ophigh wat€r tariffs in the
Capit.

Whoever is rfsponsible must
be asked abogt the provision
of water at bigh tariffs in this

area. I cannbt understand why
Capnivi, which js-em the banks
of the bef: River, must be
overcharged for water.

The Zambezi f less than a
kilometre awayffrom Katima,

yet we pay lage amounts of
moncy from fomething that
could even bg fetched directly
from the soufce.

Because Ye liy@in aldeimo-
cratic state, wehave tofact ina
democratic manner/and the
Government must /meet the
demands of its pegple.

We pay 58 cegfts a Litre and
that 1s too muclf. Some of us in
the Ministry fof Works cam
only about 490 per month
and we cah afford the high

water tanff rill also find
that the people of thif area owe
alot of money withfheir water
accounts in ’

T would welcofne it if the
relevant Ministries could come

to Caprivi and ape the lists of
people who owp the Govem-
meat. In the c@lonial era, we
paid a fixed p of RS per
month for R10 for
the house. Why Can't the now
government do the saske in an

independent Namibia?
