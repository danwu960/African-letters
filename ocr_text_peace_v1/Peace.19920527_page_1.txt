What might
have been

ONCE upon a time there was
Ayourte ul Afmeagauiled Ba-
sibia Basia had a small
populanon. Most of its people
Were peor in tems of Money
but neh in spirit. :

For many years Basibia was
tuled by a colonia: power
The ottic:als in tre colonial
gevermment pad themselves
high salanes while the people
saced. robbing Basitua of
rts wealth Jor the irown bene-
St Butthe people of Basibra
were song. For auuty years
thes fought against colonial
rule under BAPPA, the Ba-
sibian Peoples Party. After a
long and paurful struggle,
Basibia finally won its inde-
pendence. Now the Basibian
people were free to shape their
own nation.

“Now we can be just like
other nations in Africa”, sad
some of the people. “Oh no”,
said others, “we must learn
from our brothers and sisters.
We will follow their successes
and avoid their mistakes”

Basibia adopted a
constitution that was admired
all over the world because it
made Basibia a tue democ-
Tacy.

BAPPA swept to victory in
Basibia’s first election as an
independent nation because
it promused to live up to is
name as a people's party. Its
election posters said ‘United
We Stand, Divided We Fall’
and ‘Build a New Basibia tor
all Bas:bians’.

The ieader of BAPPA be-
came the first President of
Basibia He ioved the people
of Basia and was much loved
by them.

“We are all Basibians to-
gether’, he said. “Every man,
woman and child in this na-
tion is my family, and I will
not rest while any of my people
are suffering”.

“That is fine”, said some of
the members of BAPPA, “but
now we must talk about our
salaries. To keep the peace.
we have promised all the gov-
eminent employees who were
hired before independence that
their salaries will not be re-
duced. So we must pay our-
selves at least as much as
they are getting, or perhaps
even more”

“No”, said the President
“those people were robbing
our country. Why should we
follow in their footsteps? Be-
cause we work for the gov-
emument, we are given houses
to live in while many of our
people are homeless. The state
even gives us pensions and
medical aid. We will pay
ourselves modest suanes. And
Thave State House to live mn
and a government car to travel
in - I will be well taken care
of. My salary must be the
lowest of all”.

“But, Comrade President’,
the others cried, “you cin't
do that. You are the father of
the nation. Surely your salary
must be the highest. No leader
of any other country would
do such a thing”.

‘And the President replied
“You say that | am the father
of our nation - what father
would eat while his children
go hungry? A true leader does
not separate himself from his
people. Let Basibia be differ-
ent. Letus set an example for

. re

the world!”

The neat des some of the
President's advisors came to
talk to him adout Cars for the
government. “Of course,
Benz's’. they sad “The Ba-
sibian people would lke to
see us urcars that wili swt out
status as leaders”.

“No”, said the President, “T
do not think so. We willnecd
transport, but we must save
as much money as possible
for developing our nation. No
one working in this govem-
mentis going to drive a fancy
car”

“But Comrade President”,
they said, “all the highest
government officials before
independence drove expen-
sive cars. And so do Heads of
State all over the world!”

“Yes”, said the President
“but we will be different. We
will set an example. A truce
leader does not separate
himself from the people. You
must remember that most of
the people of Basibia cannot
afford a car at all. Find us
some uexpensive cars that
will get us where we need lo
go"

“Now, Commie President”.
said the advisors, “we need to
build a new place for Parha-
ment to meet"

“But why?”, said the Presi-
dent, ‘Is there no place where
we can gather to do our work?"

“Yes”, they said, “but itis
old and dingy and we will be
crowded there. We want a
fancy room with anew carpet
and leather chairs”.

“No”, said the President, ‘T
will not spend any money on
govermunent buildings until
every single person in our
nation has a home to l.ve in
Until thatday, we must get by
with what we have”

The next day tne President's
advisors were back again.
“Comrade President”. they
said, “we will have to make
many trips to other counmes.
We must share ideas and
discuss issues and make agree-
ments with the people of other
nations”.

“This is true”. said the Presi-
dent, “we must do some Tav-
elling. But we must always
think of savug money. None
of my ministers will fly first
class, and we will always stay
in the cheapest hotels”.

“But Comrade President,
they said, a government min-
ister must travel in style. You
would not want your Mmunis-
ters to be crowded and un-
comfortable”

And the President said “how
can you talk about being
crowded and uncomfortable
when have seen some of our
people living in the single
quarters, 10 and 20 people
sleeping in one tny room,
every night of their lives?”

“But what about you, com-
rade President?”, they said,
“you must have your own
plane forefficiency and s¢cu-

rity”.
“Very well, bul we must
find the’smallest, cheapest,

simplest plane that can take
me where [ need to go. A true

leader does not separate
himpelf from the people. We
are going to setanexample to
the world”.

It was not long before a
delegation came from Parlia-
ment to visit the President.
“Comrade President’, they
said, “this cannot continue.
We are Basibia’s leaders. We
fought for independence and
now we deserve our reward”.

“Yes”, said the President.
“but we did not fight alone
Would any of us be here in
goverment today if we had
not had the support of our
people? All Basbians deserve
the reward of a new Basibia
where all can prosper”.

“But, comrade President”,
they said, “no other country
in the warld operates this way.
We will be the laughing stock
of Afnca”.

“No”, sad the President, “7
think you are going to be sur-
prised”.

And it was not long before
anew spint came to Basibid -
aspiritof giving and sharing.
Government muinistnes held
compeutons to see which ones
could save the most money
Somme of the civil servants who
had been hired before inde-
pendence were so embarrassed
about their high salanes that
they asked for salary culs.
Even private citizens sold ther
fancy cars because it was so
unfashionable to be seen in
them.

And the government spent
money on health care and
education and Literacy train-
ing and development projects
and social secunty payments
for the old and unemployed.
It was not long before the
standard of living of every
single person in Basibia had
nsen. No one was hungry.
Children were healthier.
Everyone in Basibia had a
home, and almost everyone
could read. Ard the govern-
menthad been so careful with
its money tha: Basibia was
not dependent on foreign aid.
Basibia was truly free.

The President was respected
and admired more than any
other leader in any county in
the history of the world All
over Basibia people said “A
true leader does not separate
himself from the people”. They
voted for BAPPA again and
again, and Basibia remained
peaceful and prosperous.

And soon Basibia was fa-
mous. No other nation had
ever dared 10 be so different.
Visitors came streaming in
from ail over the world 10 see
this remarkable place. New
investors were attracted 10
Basibia because tl was SO
unique. People in every land
recognised the wisdom of the
President of Basibia and he
was awarded many honours
(which he always accepted in
the name of al! Basibians).

Basibians had once said
“We must be like all other
counties”. Now people in

othercountries said “we want
to be like Basibia”

And thatis how one small
nation began to change the
world

ANON

The jet outcry

IT has never been part of my
culture to engage myself in
public debates which are being
over-emphasised for polincal
gain.

In the face of the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an R80 mil-
hon jet for the Government
and officials of the Republic
of Namubia, I was faced with
several questions which I could
not help to answer.

I fully concur with the fact
thatour county faces numer-
ous problems, some short tem
and others long term. Take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane

Now the question is whether
it ig tue that those ‘Muyon-
gos’ who presuppose that the
R8O million could have been
better spent uf used for tehet
programmes are more sensi-
tive to the realities in Na-
mibia? If so, how far back
have they (Muyongos) been
so critical about the way in
which taxpayers’ money has
been spent for the purchase
of things such as Casspirs and
Mirages by their regime, the
former interim government?

Or, docs Muyongo wantus
to believe that the money mus-
used on the purchase of war
material at the ume of their
rule was ‘ess than R80 mil-
lion? And was it not taxpay-
ers’ money?

This country has inhented
a debt which i has to repay
due to the misuse of funds
and the cnminal war which
was impesed on our people.
Again, does Muyongo want
us to accept that the drought
and other social evils in our
country today are new hap-
penings? T assume not.

Unemployment. hunger, [0
mention but a few, are the
legacy of the past history ot
the country. Even at the tume
of successive colonial regimes.
the problems were there.

As these problems did not
prevent them (the Muyongos)
from purchasing wanton war
matenals which ran to bil-
ons of Rands which this
country is left to repay today,
likewise, should these pre-
vent the legitimate govern:
ment from purchasing a plane
which will enable the Presi-
dent and other Government
officials to maintain contacts
with the outside world for the
benefit of the people of this
country?

Even if the plane were not
purchased, could there be
yorneone whe would come
up with « formula which would
serve as a¢ means throurh
