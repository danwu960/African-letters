Veripi under fire

ALLOW ME to respond to the letter
published in The Namibia of July 10,
entitled ‘Coward Lister.

First I would like to inform Mr
Mungunda and his Union that Lister
| ig a fair and honest editor. The weekly
paper, The Namibian, 1s presenting
the true facts of what is happening in
thiscountry. The Namibian is the on-
ly real newspaper in Namibia which
prints the truth about the country.

Lister did not berate and insult the
| HYereros as you alleged. The paper
revealed to the public the ungodly
| work of the Nudo members Itis self-
evident that Nudo members and their
‘bishops’ are South African proxies,
who are used by the colonial govern
ment to disrupt meetings af pro-
gressive forces and character:
aysassinate Swapo members and
supPOrle;rs.

Donot misjudge Lister or accuse her
falsely. We the public know of your dir-
ty tricks.

Worst of all, you claimed that your
Union (Namibian Churches Union)is
a ‘truly Christian body’ Your letter
had nice terminology but lacked reah-
ty and is confronted with countless
dilemmas. a
Your letter covered the true core
