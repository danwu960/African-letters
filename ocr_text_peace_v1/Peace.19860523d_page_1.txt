Matjila and 435

‘inn
MR ANDREW MATIILA show-
ed himself to be a puppet when he
addressed the socalled NDEP ral-
ly in Sauyemwa, Rundu. In his
one-hour speech, he accused the
white National Party of being racist
in favouring the Odendaal system
and AG 8. He also said Resolution
435 was a United Nations product |
which was not acceptable to the .
Namibians. He agitated his au-
dience to reject Resolution 435.

He said that member countrics
of the UN had no right to say how
this country would become in-
dependent. The Namibians
themselves would decide. At the
same time he said he agreed with
the South African State President
who said Resolution 435 would be
implemented on August | provid-
ed the Cubans were withdrawn
from Angola.

How can he say that the Cubans
have to withdraw from Angolan
soil? He is confused. How can he
say in one breath that the Cubans
must leave Angola, and then in
another, say no other country can
tell you how to rule?

What did the Cubans do against
our people here in Namibia? Is it
not your puppet government which
is delaying our independence? Are
not the South Africans

manipulating you with big salaries?

What is the NDEP? It isa newly- |
established political party founded —
by the DTA in Kavango, and it
campaigns for the interim govern-
ment in Windhoek and for the
DTA in Kavango. The attendance
at the meeting Was Poor. In Mbun-
za the attendance was somewhat
better because the chief of the tribe
threatened a fine of cattle to those
who failed to attend. |

| call upon the people of f
Kavango to ignore and reject Mr
Matjila’s speech and pray for the
implementation of Resolution 435
as the only peaceful way (0 gain

our independence.
