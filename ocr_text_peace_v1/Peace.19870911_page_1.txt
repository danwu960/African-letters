| LAM a: member of Swanu and I wag
- shigeked when Comrade Sama Nujoma
said ina recent interview published in
The Namibian that Swapo wouldallow
whites to keep their farmsin Namibia
and that they would use only some
uninhabited parts of Namibia for
cooperative projects. Are we tostick to
the Namib Desert and Khomas
Hochland with our ‘cooperative’ pro-
jects a la socialism? Not at all.

The grand children of Maharero,
Mandume and Witbooi are still wag-
ing the war against the racist South
African Government to regain their
land. There must be noquestion about
it. Our forebears gave their lives in
defence of our land and the present
generation is also sacrificing their
lives to regain the land from the white
oppressors. As long as our land re-
mains in the hands of the present
white monopoly farmers, there can be
and there will be no peace and stabili-
ty in Namibia.

The questionofland isa very serious
matter which lies at the heart of our
struggle. The whites will continue to
control our economy ifthey retain the
land and our freedom will be in name
only ... something like the MPC is
claiming today. That will be a sham
freedom within poverty, white domina-
tion and exploitation of our wealth.
Such independence is definitely not
worth fighting for.

We must fight for the land and all our
natural resources. I believe that thisis
the only solution for the black majori-
ty of Namibians. The whites are still
controlling thefarms and the economy
in Zimbabwe and those who fought
during the war are not satisfied at pre-
sent. The Zimbabwean government is
trying to solve this problem which |
realise is a very difficult task at this
stage. This is why in the case of
Namibia we must grab our in-
dependence in terms ofthe ownership
of land. We must show to have learned
the lessonsof African history. The land
belongs tothe people of Africa and not
to those who call themselves ‘Euro-
peans’ in Namibia.

We cannot promise our sacred land
to the very same white farmers who
support the all-apartheid white Na-
tional Party of settlers in Namibia. We
cannot give our land to those who, in
the May 6 elections this year, return-
ed P W Botha to powerinordertopro-
tect their minority rights in Namibia.
We cannot give our land to white
farmers who train Koevoet and who
are themselves commando members
in the South African army.

Since whites do not compromise on
any issue so far, why should we com-
promise our birthright? The masses of
our people shall take over the land
from the white monopoly capitalists
with or without compensation.
