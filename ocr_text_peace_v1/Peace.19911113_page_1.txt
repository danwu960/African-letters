Money for tribes

1 AM very unhappy about the

| Way money is spent by the
Government on issues related
to tnbalism in Caprivi. The
Govemment of the day is no:
aware thatthe Basubiais using
it to defend tribalism. On the
other hand, the Mafwe are left
victims of the tribal acts of the
Basubia, while the government
dangles its legs on the fence of
prospenty.

Chief Moraliswam should be
called to order by the Govern-
ment. And those who were
involved in the unconstitutional
inauguration of the chief as
Paramount Chief be disciplined
accordingly. The Basubia have
gone too far with their abuse of
democracy and now 1s the time
they should be given a lecture
to bang them tu their senses.

Much has been said about
the Basubia and the Mafwe arc
fed up with them. If the Gov-
emment fails to discipline them,
the Mafwe are bound to doit

The military and police were

_ despatched to Capnvi in the
name of mataining peace.
Recently the Basubia cheated
the government to say that
people are being lalled in the
Capnvi and that there were
many in the moruary, many
injured and many admutted to
hospital. Forces were des-
patched but found the claims
unfounded. What a waste of
laxpayers) monev The Bas.
ubia should know tha: this
money is supposed to be used
for capital projects to the ad-
vantage of Namibians and not
just one tmba: group. i call
upon taxpayers to condemn the
abuse of money un this man-
ner.

[In the history of Namibia no
chiefhas ever been made para-
mount over one tnbe let alone
another chief's temtory. Moral-
iswani 1s geographically not
really a chief because he lives
under the junsdiction of an-
other chief, and his advisors,
like Likando and Mwazi, should
make him aware of this.

The same chief should re-
member how his Khuta used to
punish the youth to impress
the Boers (Mayumbelo, Juluka
and Sampati are alive and can
bear this out); and the same
Basubia told the Boers how
pro-Swapo the Mafwe were in
the past. The opposite is now
taking place with the group

claiming that Swapo is theirs
and DTA is for Mafwe - what
double standards! J call on the
Govemment to intervene and
to call the two chiofs to order.
