Namibians for freedom

1 READ YOUR newspaper with
great interest. It is good to see that
your staff take the problems of our
country to heart and that you report
on it. ] therefore feel free to come to
you with a great worry in my heart.

The past weeks ] have heard over
the radio that there are problems in
Swapo. There seems to be tribalism
and disunity because of people who
want lo participate in the peace talks.

It is not good for a strong
organisation like Swapotoimprison
people who want to talk. Swapo are
losing a lot of support by that kind
Of acuon. Let the people come and
taik. who donâ€™t want to bea part of
Swapo anymore. Swapo will not lose

but will only come out better and it
will show a just organisation.

J] feel that it is time to stand
together and show the world that
Namibians want feal freedom. We
must cast out the people who don't
want the same as us.

I feel it is time for our leaders to
come to Namibia so the people can
see them again, because only a few
know them anymore. This will make
the people strong again.

Let us not listen to the stories
anymore. Letus make our promises
good.
