ALLOW me to answer DT Presi-

| dent Mishake Muyongo oa hiv two
_ questions as to whether Swap: <>

fulrilled the promises it made in 1989
an how many people have used the
Falcon jet?

Of course Swapo fulfilled its prom-
ises, We are now living in better hous-
ing, have better communication fa-
cilities, better education, better
healthcare and Swapo has also re-
duced the unemployment rate. We are
how living in peace, no more
‘makakunyas’ destroying our maize
fields and beating up people and
Swapo has buried apartheid forever.

With regard the jet, how many peo-

ple does Mr Muyongo feel should
have used it? Does he want everyone
to use 1t? The Falcon is not a taxi but
wan sport for the President and his Min-
isters.

I strongly believe people will not
vote DTA and that they will lose the
forthcoming electicns with no single
seat in Parliament.

President Nujoma should not con-
cern himself about the DTA in the
coming elecuons. Swapo will make
sure he rules this country for the rest of
his life.
