4E economy of our country is being

Western capitalists who are assisting
the illegal regime of Pretoria in our
country.

There are numerous multinational!
companies operating illegally in
Namibia today, viz. CDM, Rio Tinto,
TCL, Soekor and others. These com-

1ies are mining Namibian minerals

contrary to UN Decree Number 1.

Millions of tonsof diamonds, copper,
and metric tons of uranium are ex-
ported illegally to Nato-member
countries.

The Namibian people, under the
leadership of Swapo, the sole and
authentic representative, have tried on
many occasions to oust Pretoria from
Namibia but because fine racist
government has the ba-xing of the
capitalist West, this has not succeeded.

When one travels Namibia, one sees
evidence of how our resources are ex-
ploited and exhausted. The freeway
down to the south is always full of
heavy duty trucks loaded with cattle
being taken to South African markets,
while many ofour children are looking
for food in rubbish bins and are sleep-
ing with empty stomachs. There are
more bottle stores than educational
facilities.

And while our natural resources and
agricultural potential is being ex-
ploited, our independence igsmadecon-
ditional to the withdrawal of Cuban
troops from the People’s Republic of
Angola. The Cubans have been in
Angola for almost eleven years now,
and are only seen as a threat by the
cowboy regime in Washington.

Ifapartheid Pretoria had not invad-
ed Angola in 1975, there would have
been no Cubans there today. Pretoria,
is responsible for what happened in
that country just beforc independence.

We are no 80 naive to be misled into
believing the Cubans are a threat;
Namibia was never colonised or invad-
ed by Cubans. Weonly know apartheid
South Africa,

South Africa should quit Namibia
now and leave us in peace todecide our
own future, through internationally-
aupervised elections under UN Securi-

_ ty Counci! Resolution 435.
