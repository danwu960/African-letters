Kameeta on Gerises

RECONCILIATION is not a matter
of speeches or open letters in news.
Papers. Reconciliation is an act of
coming towards one another, tallas3
to one another, looking together fut
the problem which is facing us and
finding a solution for it, so that we
can be truly reconciled and live to-
gether in peace. Accusations will
divide us more and make reconcili-
ation difficult to achieve.

The article in the CCN newsletter to
which Ms Regina Gerises is refer-
ring was written by Reverend K
Vermeulen. He w addressing the
question of reconciliation between
black and white and quoted what I
said in that regard. To refer to that
article as a ‘proof’ that I only sce
reconciliation in terms of white and
black, is to take the nearest stick to
hit a dog.

At numerous occasions in public
meetings and in private discussions
my stand was an is that we must
openly discuss and resolve the ques-
tions surrounding the serious and
sensitive issue of ALL missing, de-
tained and dead Namibians, so that
we can be truly reconciled and re-
build our nation together in peace.
I therefore applaud the unanimous
decision of the Parliament to request
the Prime M‘nister after consultation
with the political parties in the Na-
tional Assembly, to head a commis-
sion which will investigate this issue
and report back to Parliament within
90 days.

Tam not-ashamed and do not rogret

way can we be traly reconciled and
live in peace together.

A serious breach

ON Mfiy°St, B; asked to
resign from my position as Jub-edi-
tor af the Times of Nampibif without
having received-earfy prior waming.
Managoerént claimed that my work
Was 0d . Pte

A colleague | Tiiormed me that
he had begfi aware of the fact that I
was to beNQred before this was re-
layed to me. Sur bjs is & serious
breach of confidentialNy between
employer and employee;
Many other questiert®in this regard
remain upartSwered. It was rumoured
that because sacrepancy be-
tween the salanes paidte reports and
sub-editors, maerfégement had to fire
one sub-edftor in order to give a
salary inckgase of R50 to each re-
porter.

The company's high Maff tumover
due to what appears {otbe a policy of
indiscnminate-fnng and firing’ is
disturbing-This policy creates an at-
mospheSe_of instability in the work-
ing environment and ins}cunty among
staff employed by-tht¥ establishment.
It would appar that the problem here
h the quality of service
but the financritsityation of the
newspaper. It is a pity tha\instead of
trying to solve problgat¥ in a more
constructive r, staff are made
by managepr€nt to feel redundant.
