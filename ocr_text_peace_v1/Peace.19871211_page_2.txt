The SA government is also engaged
in the indoctrination of Namibians:
organisations like Etango, Ezuva,
Namwi Foundation and Ichtus are
there to mislead, confuse and distort
the truth of the liberation struggle.
Etango, the socalled religiouscultural
group rules with the Bible andthe gufn.
Has no-one told these organisations
that Namibians are not communists:
they are oppressed instead by those
who brought the Word of God to Africa.
The oppressors also infiltrate black
schools by means of involvement in
sport, and cadets.

Recently, two makaku nyas from 101
and 202 Battalions respectively, spoke
of discrimination within the socalled
SWATF; said they were forced to fight
on the side of Unita in Angolan ter-
ritory; and resignations have started
because they are not ready to fight
their brothers who want to liberate the
country from the Botha regime. It isa
lesson for us to reject and condemn con-
scription and instead call for the
withdrawal of the SADF from Nami-
bian territory.

The recent invasion of the SADF in.
to Angola: the SADF isthe obstacle to
peace in southern Africa. They are
destabilising the Angolan economy,
and both the SADF and Reagan Ad-
ministration supply the Unita bandits
with Stinger missiles, sophisticated
armaments. The aggressor should stop
fighting for Unita and instead
withdraw its troops from Angolan soil
and go home.
