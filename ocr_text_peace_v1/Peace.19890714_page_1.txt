ation in Nemible, 10 mest a lot of
very kindy people and myself give a
mnall comribution to the country where
T have lived for nearly ten years. As
an emigrant I have no problem of
divided loyalites: Yugoslavia is my
mother and Namibia is my wife. The
first brought me into this world and
the second I have willingly chosen as
a partner for life. Perhaps my letter
should be viewed in a similar, if not
the same, light.

It makes me sad when | see how
many born Namibians do not use
their education and knowledge to
help their own country and work for
the benefit of their own people. This
makes things worse for those who
prefer to work for enemics of the
peaceful implementation of Resolu-
uon 435.

I believe every responsible resi-
dent of this country should take the
Ongoing process very senously and
uy their best to make it succeed.

This is an histoncal event, which
our children and future genesations
are going to learn about in the class-
rooms.

There are many powerful forces in
Namibia working to see the process
fail and war and suffering start again.
They are the forces which, in the
past, were never in favour of inde-
pendence, and were planning some
sort of independence of their own
without internauonal recognition.

The South Afncan Government
was never serious about 435 and its
posiuon is sull unchanged. South
Afnica really intended to reduce the
high cost of the Angolan war and
switch it to Namibia, which is much
cheaper. This is only possible with
its faithful puppets which have long
experience in doing ‘dirty work’.

We know, and Pretoria knows even
better, that it is impossible to hold a
free and fair clection here when
Koevoet has poopie at gunpoint. 11
would seem as though South Africa
is trying to force Untag to ‘wash ius
hands of this affair’ and diseppesr.
This would then give them the op

otiy wn
may vote for those who wens
and are still, in favour of
Namibian independonce.

On the SWABC

AS report tr_[heWamibian of

Elecuon Directo t SWABC
could nop be-<offipelicd to give equal

CAUSE ILLS NOt a Slate -Quafed corpora-
uion but a “‘pgsastital’’.

There is Kolegal basis whatsoever
for this assertion. SWABC-s gov-
emed by the Brogdessting Act, No
73 of 1976. Qs Act sets forth the
powers of the SWABT and imposes
certain duues and obligetfons on its
exercise of th pOwers. It has al-
feady b ended by the Adminis-
Taiko fUree tities and
is absolutely nothipgsfeventing him
from amender§ it again to require
equal access Tor all poMtrcnl partics
or alliances during the elegefon cam-
paign.

We demgndtiat the AG stop using
legal ob bon to hide his real rea-
sons for Teftsing—ta act to
SWABC's biased broadhasting.
