There has been one death gen.
tence. There is no change over
the three years in the general
leniency towards offenders against
women. An apt comment on the
situation was offered by Justice
Hendler in June last year when he
sentenced a young man to 9 ycars
for murder and 7 for raping the |
battered body, observing that there |
appeared to be ‘*an open season
on women"’

Complacency won't reverse the
trend. We need a new awareness
and ‘mutual respect. Whereas the
community of world cultures has
committed itself to eamestly re-
examine power relationships,
economic relationships and rela-
tionships of force (ie oppression)
between the sexes, and aims to
discover new laws of living which
will ensure equal dignity and self-
esteem for all human beings with-
out exception, Namibia appears
to be sinking ever more deeply
into callousness. Let Mr Matjila
and all who like him trivialise the
brutality which stains our cul-
ture, consider if they please the
admonition of Jeremiah: “They
have healed also the hurt of the |
daughter of my people slightly,
saying, peace, peace, where there |
is no peace’ ’, (6:14, King James
version) and welcome instead of
denouncing all initiatives by more
enlightened agencies which aim
to advance Namibian women (0
equal human dignity.
