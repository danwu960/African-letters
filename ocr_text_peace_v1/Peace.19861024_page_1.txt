It is dishonest to nominate someone
who has been in Namibia for six
months and ignoring those who were
born, and are going to die, here.

National unity?

I WISH to air my point of view on the
cabinet of the government of national
disunity, which tried hard to unite
the people but instead just succeed.
ed in uhiting Namibians against
them. This government should
therefore he disbanded

Since the interim government was
imposed hy the South African
government. the socalled ministers
in this government started arguing
among themselves and sometimes
even went to court disunits

Instead of finding wavs tu rmprove
the living standards of the people,
they came up with inhuman laws
against the Namibian people; instead
of working for the interests of the
Namibian people. they have been
working for the interests of the South
African regime; inatead of bringing
about justice in this country, they
have contributed to the rape of
justice.

Theoretically the ministers pro-
pagate that apartheid no longer ex-
ists in Namibia, but apartheid is still
in existence in virtually every part
of the country.

They have failed to abolish AG 26,
AG 9, AG 8 and other draconian
laws. Instead they have strengthen:
ed discrimination among the
bian people.

Theee self-appointed ministers,
eepecially Mr Andreas Shipanga, all
claim to be in favour of reconciliation
tain Namibians but they are ac-.

in causing hatred

Mr Shipangn hae staced
fessor C Lombard for visiting
and acoused him of being
Swapo convert, and even:

spokesman.

I want to ask Mr Shipanga
kind of reconciliation he propagates
if people are not allowed to
views with other Namibians? What
kind of freedom of does he
propagate in the Bill of Rights if he
does not want Professor Lombard to
express his views about Swapo?

In view of the above, and other
facts, the interim government should
be disbanded, and the South African
Government should allow the Nami-
bian people to elect their own leaders
through the implementation of the
Resolution 435 peace-plan.

Anti-abortion

I WISH air my views on @ problem
which if on the in ein our coun-
try, nafnely abgrtion. feel that abor-
tion if a sindnd an legal practite.

Mgny yodng girls bétween the
of 16 to X98 are having abortions.
do ey not take care with
contraceptives?

I fee) that a pefson who has an
abortion is guilty @ murder. How can
you kill an unbgrn child, because
that child also has the right to live.
Abortion is a sit, whether done pro-
fessionally or primitively.

I want to call on theee socalled ‘d
tors’ who are helping these girls, 1
desist from this practice. pf dem
guilty of murder. .
