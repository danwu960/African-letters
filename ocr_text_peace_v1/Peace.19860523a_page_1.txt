WHAT Sean Cleary up to in
Lopd6n with his new baby, the
Via LJieot.

His ledd article extolling the vir-
tues of the transitioM™ government
and the importapeeof ethnic dif-
ferences is ten by none other
than apfrish right wing Northern
Ireland pa,Reverend Mar-
tin Smyth, who is)incorrectly
described as a Pfesbyterian

minister.

As astfember of fan Paisley’s
self-made Free eretbyterian
Church has very little ex-
pepefice of Namibian-pelitics but
excels himself along Paisley in
reminding olics and Pro-
testants J Ister of their ‘ethnic
differchees-

The Free Presbyeefian churches
preach anti@&tholic messages
from its pufits and through open
air ‘Nuremburg-type’ raDies and
along with the Orgae Order
(which Smyth head@$) has much to
do with fepefenting anger and
violence.

SeanfCleary, with a name like
yours, you should know better.

False statement

PLEASE permit me to answer to
the embarrassing statement
Swapo does the same, but nobody
complains .... in The Namibian of
May 16.

The angry residents and their
tribal chief, in and around Om-
balantu in northern Namibia, are
totally against the actions of the
South African Police and Defence
Force and not against Swapo.

Obviously the people in the
north are annoyed by the South
Afncan Police and Defence Force’s
“systematic and cleverly planned’
manner of waiting until the
harvesting period before these units
come in and destroy their many
months of hard work.

In Windhoek, the Police
spokesman’s comment on the in-
cidents, in my reasoning, is alarm-
ing. His words ‘... Swapo does the
same but nobody complains ..’ are
absurd and embarrassing and
perhape deliberately said to ignore
the complaints and the truth of the

The statement ‘Swapo does the
same’ is patently false since Swapo

has no military vehicles, which ac-
cording to the complaints, the
SADF drove through mahangu
fields and homesteads. How can
someone from the north be ex-
pected to believe such a statement?

While the police and army claim
to be the defenders of the people,
the Namibians themselves have re-
jected this claim, since Namibians
have experienced untold crimes at
the hands of these forces. These
cannot be erased from our minds

We do fear the action of these
forces and call for the immediate
withdrawal of South African police
and army. We want peace, justice
and truth and this can be im-
plemented through Resolution 435.

The Namibians have tasted the
colonial fruit of the South African
Government and its puppet institu-
tions in Namibia, and it tastes
bitter.
