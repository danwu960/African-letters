Namibia message

WE, the participants in a fast for the
SA DF to be withdrawn from Namibia,
send warm greetings toall Namibians.

Our fast has been part of the End
Conscription Campaigns Apartheid
Out - SADF Out campaign. The fast
began on August 3 and ended on
Namibia Day, August 26. Some of us
have fasted for one day of this period,
others for longer and some for the en-
tire three and a half weeks.
