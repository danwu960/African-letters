Nangoloh
challenge

PHIL ya Nangoloh alleged thar
a female activist of his socal-
led National Society for Hu-
man Rights visited Lubango
and was informed by a com-
Mander at a Swapo house there
that ‘Swapo detainces’ would
Only be released and repatri-
ated in 1998 if Swapo gets ao
two-thirds majority in the
general clection.

He further claimed that the
detainees are being re-educaied
and that that ‘certain high offi-
| cialsin the Namibian Ministry
of Education pay visits there to
address the detainces’.

Phil ya Nangoloh even wen!
so far to categorate and com.
pile a list of people who alleg-
edly went missing while in
Swapo detention and nu mber-
ing them according to their
tribes. He claims that among
the said number there were 16
Caprivians, 38 Ndongas, 55
Kwanyamas, 43 Kwambis and
96 Windhoekers.

Th the wake of the scandal-
ous pevelations by Nico Bas-
eon, a self-confessed 6x-propa-

of the Intelligence
of the 8ADF in this
country end earlier exposure

by others, the frequency of the
orchestrated atlacks against

- Swapo has again increased of

late.

In the light of these accusa-
tions,
demands that Phil ya Nangoloh
produces full names, addresses
and specific areas of ongin of
the following: the female ac-
livist who went to Labango:
ihe commander who was met

by this activist in Lubango; the |
officials from the Ministry of

Education who met the ‘de-

detainees referred to above and
the names of the rest of the 625
detainees he claimed went
missing in Swapo detention as
per the updated list.

Swapo has undertaken to
make a preliminary report about
the sacnfices made dunng the
war in terms of human lives
and hopes that the report will

be available before the end of |

this year. However, the prov-
ess of searching for missing
persons will, hke in any other

war, continue for a long tinie
; Clerk of Ludenitz, or Mr Voges,

to come.

Swapo of Namibia pro- |

pounded the policy of national
reconciliation aimed at bnng-
ing peace, political stability
and unity among our people
which are pre-requisites for

Swapo of Namibia |

economic development.
However, elements in this

: Country who are faithful to their

sponsors continuc to distort the
painful episode in the dark page
of the colonial history in this
country, thus impainng this

| policy. Swapo will not allow

this to continue.

In conclusion we wish to
state that should Phil ya Nan-
goloh fail to produce the infor-
mation as outlined above,
Swapo will be forced to take

the appropnate action.
