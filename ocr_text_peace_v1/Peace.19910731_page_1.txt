people.

Your observation that our
decision to disaffiliate from
Swapo was shortsighted,
immature and irresponsible, is
a dogmatc approach that 1s
accompanied by a security
phobia and a serous lack of
analysis on the role of mass
Organisations in 2 post-colo-
mal ¢ra. You seem not to be a
democrat at all.

Nanso is opting for a disci-
plined working alliance with
parues who share common
programmes, objectives and
campaigns. Nanso cannot be
apolitical in a political eavi-
ronment.

Hence the need for stnilang a
balance between the need for
strengthemng the organisation's
independent base on the one
hand, and the role Nanso will
have to play wn our country’s
restructunng of the economy
and the formulatonof policies
on the other hand. Our impact
on the situation will depend on
our representation, unity and
strength on the ground.

Our most immediate task is
to mobilise and unite our stu-
denis. Majonty of our students
are wnorgamsed. White schools
remain & challenye and some
i students are in undemocratic
_ student bodies.

We want a Nanso that is
independent, deme tatre, ae

» counteble and unde: contro, v!
| its members, not a Nanso that
» isaconveyor belt for positions
; or decisions of other organisa-
; tions. Lastly we want to de-
velop our leadership and
strengthen our organisationa:
base.

dom ts here to atay, but some-
limes it icels and looksasifwe
are not free at all. There are
some stones circulation in our
town (Rundu) that houses for- |
merly intiabited by whites only
will be handed over to the |
Mirustry of Works whule those |
houses in black arcas wil! re.
son under the control of the
Ministry of Local Govermmens
and Housing. This means that
black people will not be given
houses in the former white area
and vice versa. Black families
currently living un this area are
subyect to removal at any Iime
to look for their own housing
should the authority wish to do
so. If this is true, ] think that
people are still being treated
like trash in this region.
Benefits which were aimed
to help whites and other for-
eigners to live a comfortable
life, such as the north package
for living in a war-tom area,
are sul] being received by whites
only. This package covers util. |
ties like free water, free elec-
tnaity. free gas, rent-free houses

- and even pay just for being a

white person Everyone inthis

Any white whocomesto the

blacks have to meet certain
requirements Some single
whites hve in big, rent-free

1 know that housing is a
national problem, but itis bad

ens of then relatives

Windhoek or elsewhere ts

| employed bere, especially in

service of the government, a
house is automatically given
to that person, which is not the
cuse when someone from this
area is employed in Windhoek.

1 know that this is done to
encourage people to accept
employment in the sub-urban
and rural areas, but it looks
like peopie from Windhoek are
deemed to be more important
than us. High- ranking jobs are
preferably given to those
comung from the capital, who
maght not necessanly have
appled for them, instead of
people un the sub-urban and
rural areas who did apply. This
is an nmult to our intelligence,
leadership qualities and our
ability to lead even on a re-
gional level. | am not saying
that we do not need people
from Windhoek, but we should
be conndered on equal terms.
I know that Windhoek is the
centre of everything, but let us
not undermine, neglect or ig-
nore the potential and ability
of people living in the sub-
urban and rural areas as was
done in the past

My appeal to the govern-
ment is:

- to look senously into the
matter of these unfair prac-
hices and connnuous demumam-
sing treatment

- the goverment cannot, as
we know, build houses for
everyone, theretore it should
give low interest loans to the
poopie who build their own
houses Puunk this wall allew
ate the current housing prob
tem while other alternatives
are being explored

-the Muustry concemeed wath
Nousue should spend time,
he sples feeding street kids,
raising funds ter buuding low
ae tes Touses wh over Na
mibia. These houses would
provide shelter and safe home
environment to street lads once
adopted by the low income
fanulies

- the northem package should
stop with immediate effect
because there is no longer war
m this area and we should all
get ashare. We fought to bnng
