Ten Reasons Why Cap

ALLOW me to clear up
and elaborate on what has

' become a controversial

hot potato on the name

, change for Capnvi.

Who was Caprivi to
start with? Caprivt was a
German Cuptain in the
German colonial army.
Shortly betore they were
defeated by the British
and the South Afmean
forees, Captain Capris
and his torces quickls
decided in that short ses-
sion held at then Head-
quarters: Schuckmianns
burg (o naine the region
Caprivi in addition of the
existing Henge name

This was decided ta
have a two-fold connota-
tion. Firstly as a landmark
that Clearly states that the
entire Namibia was calo-
mised by Germany. See:
ondly. wath the name
Capri intact it was casy

for Germany to reclaim
the entire country back
after the war and review
allsigned agreements with
Britain.

A name change for
Caprivi is long overdue;
Was supposed to change
subsequently after rade-
pendenee in 1990.
Change is inevitable and
we cannotrun away from
It

Why the name change?

SThe scrambling of
Aftcan history teaches us

that most Afneans come
from the Great Lakes
where the name Capnvi
never existed, hence it
only came alive in 1915.
(Note: languages existed
before the name Capny1)

4 The naine Capnvidis-
eriminates hence all
Nanubians residing there
cannot be called
Caprivian.onty those bom

nothing in common with

could have been a con-

1) Caprivi is the only
Namibian region, which
has
no hustoncal background

with its people.

The mame praises
Caprivi and his father
