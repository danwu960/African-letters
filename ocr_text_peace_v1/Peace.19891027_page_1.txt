and therefore not their leader.

A tnbal leader cannot be a national

leader al the same time. And Riruako
is being made to wither away as
President of the DTA. Muyongo, using
the smal] amount of credibility he
gained as a result of being Vice Presi-
dent of Swapo, appears to have taken
over, but of course not beyond the
powers of Dirk Mudge who is the
long-sustained and indispensable
South African umbilical cord, with-
out which DTA cannot stand on its
own.
” This no exaggeration to say that the
DTA is essentially a mixture of
unmixable opposites. Most leaders
in the DTA - Mudge, Riruako.
Muyongo, Africa, Kashe - are not
Namibian leaders, but uibal ones.

Can the DTA therefore even talk
about a united Namibia, or one
Namibia one Nation?

Botha’s threat

I PERCEIVED with dismay the
threatening statement made by South
African Foreign Affairs Minister,
Roelof Botha, on his recent visit to
Windhoek to the effect that “if any-
thing unforeseen happens between
now and Namibian independence,
which violates any of the agreed
principles his government reserved
the right to take whaicver stcps it

doomed necessury’’.

1 would like to remind the colonisers
that we did not invite South Africa to
invade our beloved Namibia and
subject it to colonialism and all that
gocs with it, and their presence here
has aiways been illegal, nor did we
consent to the German fascism of
von Trotha.

We fought back tooth and nail
against these forces unul today when
the deeply yeamed-for freedom and
independence 1s about to be born.

We know South Afnca is not
committed to genuine implementa-
tion of 435, and if it was not for the
heavy burden of war, which the oc-
cupier could not sustain, then the
future of this country would stil] be
locked in chains.

If any ‘unforeseen’ happens in this
country, as Mr Botha fears, then it
wil undoubtedly be the fault of Pre-
tora. Namibians are peace loving
people who have no intenuon of
invading other nations or neighbours.

Mr Botha should restrain his forces
and cease their clandestine activi-
tics. South Africa must not attempt
to create a pretext to invade this
country to perpetuate colonialism or
insutute neo-colomalism.

It is unacceptable for the SADF or
SAP to retum to our soil under any
circumstances.

They should be restrained and
disciplined. This nation does not want
the smell of blood while striving for
peace, stability and the nght lo na-
hionhood,
