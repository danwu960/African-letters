"guided Seca of our society who
seem to have misunderstood the
meaning of independente.

Iam particularly referring to those
who are not happy with Comrade
James Chivikwa for having taken the
good step of apprehending those who
have stolen other people's property,
such as cars,

Those unsocial elements who are
not happy that Comrade Chivikwa
has done his duty must be condemned
in the strongest terms.

Independence and forgiveness does
not mean to protect the thieves and
criminals in this country. We have
liberated Namibia in order tq restore
peace and freedom for our people,
regardless of colour or creed.

Nanubia has not been liberated to
have freedom for chaos and insecu-
rity.

I believe that Inspector Chivikwa
is doing his national! duty in the cor-
rect way for the goodness and protec-
tion of our people. Those who have
stolen the vehicles belonging to oth-
ers must make sure that they don't do
SO again.

We freedom lovers must make sure
you are brought to book for your
criminal deeds. Our gover .
not submit to blackmail sod yore
