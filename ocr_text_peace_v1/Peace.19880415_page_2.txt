Unfortunately we often hear the par-
rotcry that “thechurch should not be
involved or mixed with politics”, as if
there isadivinecommand, especially
given tocertain people, tobe political-
ly involved. |

The irony of the issue is that most of
those whocry loudly that “the church
should or even must not mix with
politics’ are themselves members of
the Church - of whom some may well
still gotochurch on Sundays. The ques-
tion is: where do they hide their
mysterious political bodies and souls
when they go tochurch clothed in their
church body-souls?

It should be known by both believers
and non-believers that the church pro-
claims the God who created the
universe including mother earth. Does
politics take place outside and beyond
this universe? If that is the case, then
the Church would be wrong to be con-
cerned with political oppression and
injustices taking place outside God’s
created cosmos. As far as we know,
politics is done not only on earth but
exercised by these God-created
creatures - human beings. Ontheother
hand, the language of the church
transcends this life to heaven as well.

If politics is touching the lives of
church members in Namibia, how can
it be, that the Church of God of justice
and love can be indifferent to suffering
and the selfish spirit of imperialism?
Ifthe Church’s mission before all else
is supernatural - preaching only
reward in heaven whenone diesand let
misery sndoppression inthis life pass
unabated - then no wonder some temp-
ted tocall it the “opium of the people”.
