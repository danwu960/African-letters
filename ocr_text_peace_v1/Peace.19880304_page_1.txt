. peoples’ bank?

bishigh time that Namibians be
de aware of the racist and selfish
.dencies of the management of the
alled First National Bank, Barclays
northern Namibia.

Jarclays Bank has been doing
siness im northern Namibia for
ate now, but still, itie very clear thet

management never had the id-

esis of our people at heart .
The management of that bank does
tcare about black Namubians, they
p always served as third class. Black
amibians are made toe queue for
urs outside in the dust and heat as
they are not human beings.

The racists that are running the
arclays Bank have made special ar-
ngementsfor whitesin Oshakatito
ve better service and also their own
rencies through which to channel
onies and in 30 doing to avoid the
nd of suffering and delay that blacks
ave to live up with.

The quality of service rendered at
14s bank for black people is very. very
oor. There is no provision for
pperate savings and current account
epartments, causing people to queue
1p in the same line.

People living in far-lying areas such
2 Ombaiantu, Uukwaluudhi,
luacama, Nkongo, Ongandjera and so
orth are the ones that suffer most.
They are forced to travel at high speed
ecause of the curfew, and in so doing

the rate of accidents, and

AL a. te ee eee ee
Namibians for a cup of cold water. And
then...

You are directly and indirectly
responsible for the innocent blood that
is flowing inthis country. Your satanic
deeds wil} not be left unpunished.

We salute you, Comrade Nambondi,
we salute you.
