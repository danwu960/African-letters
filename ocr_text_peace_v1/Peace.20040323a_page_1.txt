Fewer Hate
Speeches, Please!

NAMIBIAN voters havea right to be informed inorder
to cast their votes with commitment and maturity as
far as their future is concerned. [tis in that context that
we - again - request “leaders” to stick to the rules of
democracy and free and fair elections.

Mr. Tyirtange, your previous position as Minister of
Justice should have instilled a respect for the Namibian
Constitution in you. That should at least reach as far as
knowing that it is NOT SWAPO that created the
Namibian Defence Force, Police, Civil Service etc. etc.
- that is an obligation every Government of a country
has.

Swapo is just another political party and not the
Government. Sic - we do not live in 1960 anymore - the
year 2044 1s here and we have and want to move on.

We all have an understanding that you might still
fee! bitter about your past - let us, however, look ahead
and rather work for a future that does not bring back
those years. Namibia has so many problems that need
tangible solutions. Solutions will not be found by clinging
on to the past and asking weird questions hke: “What
did Ben Ulenga tell the Boers to be released?”

Absurd statements like “the CoD has been created
by colontalists”.

By the way, Sir, the CoD is a legitimate political
party and not an organisation. You can condemn the
“colonisers” till eternity - as fong as you, the Swapo
party, still depend on them for food assistance for
Namibians your statements boomerang.

Tell the voters why is it necessary to apply for N$37.7
million donor assistance to feed Namibians?

Teli the voters why only foreigners get major building
contracts these days?

Tell the voters why they - after 14 years of
mdependence - stul live in shacks and shambles?

Why is almost every municipality bankrupt in
Nambia? .

Why is each and every parastatal costing the
Namibian taxpayers milhons and millions?

Sir -yvouas former Minister of Justice - should cry out
loud: babies and toddlers are raped on a daily basis.
Criminals rule the country - Namibtans get murdered
for a few dollars - corruption never gets punished.

The hist, Lam afraid, is endless! The Police force ts ill
equipped. ill-trained - why would Windhock otherwise
ask for a Municipal Police Force?

The Namibian Defence Force - whois insane enough
to want to attack Namibia - Nambia does not need that
Force. The money could be spent on housing/educations
health services etc. etc. All these and many more
pressing issues and what can be done about it.

That makes up election material for many months —
Sir-notyour defamations and agitating hate speeches.

Howeser-af your attacks on the CoD are an indicator
to vo by - the Cob is doing a good job and giving you
ample reason to see an opposition in that party,

Mr Tjitianye, please come up with solutions for
Namibians since we all Know that the tax pavers — and
thatincludes opposition party members - pay for Swapo
rallies

We have peace in Namibia - thatis also a credit Co
opposition partes since we can argue in parliament
and don't hase to take up weapons - lets keep it that
way. please. and let's tackle Namibia's multuple
problems toxether.

Create a plattorm for FREE and FAIR elections.
