It wou! d appear that the problem here
is not so much the quality of service

Police dilemma

I WONDER why you (Ms Gwen
Lister) and some of your staff seck
opportunities to discredit the gov-
emment of the Republic of Namibia.
I refer to the article ‘Pepsi Boys -
Lively Lions share the spoils’ writ-
ten by Conrad Angula on May 28.

Ths statements implying that the
Namibian police are discriminating

also irresponsible.

Tam convinced that you would make
a significant contribution toward
reconciliation and to peace and eta.
bility, if you order your reporters not
to acoept the version of ‘one furious
spectator’ about the policy of the
goverment or the actions of the patice,
but rather to check such allegations
and eniotive utterances with the rele-
vant authontics.

Seeing that Mr Angula has a high
office in soccer circles, I would rec-
ommend that he initiates a meoting
between soccer administrators and
the police to work oul ways and
means to ensure thal soccer specta-
tors can enjoy the game in peace and
secunty. At such a meeting the po-
lice will explain their position and
their dilemma.

Please contnbute towards the good
efforts of the Nanubian Govemment
to ensure Jaw and order and to effect
meaningful reconciliation, by not
discrediting a government depart-
ment just for the sake of an own
political motive.

BRIG. S EIMBECK
PRIVATE BAG 12024
WINDHOEK

Note: Bngadier Exmbeck, you have
opposed this newspaper and all it
stands for, since its inception. You
even opposed the registration of The
Nanubianinaswom statement, say-
ing that Lister and her political back-
ground proved that the newspaper
would become a ‘threat to state secu-
nty and the maintenance of public
order’. You similarly opposed the
pasty which now makes up the gov-
emment of the day. You claim now
to have changed your political view-
point. Well and good. If this is truly
the case then please stop your polih-
cal tecucs. Conrad Angula riised a
very legitimate point in the article in
question: namely, the lack of police
presence for ae long as we can re
momber, at soccer maiches. There is
a lot of hooliganism, and violent
incidents, and jast weekend was 00
exception as you are well aware. Oo
the other band, It is an undisputable

against sports lovers on the basis of fect that rugby matches are well-
colour are not only unfounded but Monitored by the police (Last woek-

end’s match against Wales for ox-
ample). You can make your own
comparisons in this regard. Purther,
itis not the job of a reporter to initiate
moetings between the police and soocer
administrators. That's your job. His

. is Co report on events as they occur,

The Namibian supports the idea of a
police force to maintain and uphold
public order. Its a new concept for
most Namibians who have in the past
seen the police as their enemy (in
most cases, quite rightly so) since the
latter have acted against political
Opponents in mogt cases. So its upto
the police to prove themselves to the
public in order to eam their trust and
confidence.

Lastly, Brigadier, don't make such
laughable statements such as ‘‘why
you and some of your staff seek
opportunities to discredit the gov-
emment of the Republic of Namibia’.
You know quite wel! that this is not
the issue here. - Gwen Lister.

On-forgiverpes

TRY forgiving gfnend who betrays
a confidengef or a co-worker who
tells hesbout you. When the real
effort of forgiveness t . there
1s NOLL easy about 11. lastyglt urges
us fo pay back in kind.

Some people are capgMle of heroic
Yrort in reconciling; phhers not. There
JT osvally a pausyp/detween tho hurt
and the ime whén trust and love can
take root agash. Forgiveness is part
of a processfhat begins with hurt and
onds, in ityfinal goal, with reconcili-
ation.

i works nly when we become aware
of the d¢pths and causes of the anger

wholeheartedly and g anendur-

Too often, we bypass forgiveness
entirely. We rece fom our burtto an
