On SWAPOL

KILLING won't help Namibians,
especially those Swapol members in
Windhoek.

It is our plea for those peace-loving
Namibians to try and look at the
political struggle with some common
sense.

Many people, especially members of
Swapol, also known as Koevoet, seem
to believe that physical violence will
change our views as Namibians in this
country.

I and two comrades, living in the
Katutura compound, were assaulted
by drunk membersof Swapol on April
15(a Wednesday) after midnight at the
Rasta Funk Disco.

Why do members of these forces at-
tack innocent Namibians? Were they
appointed to maintain law and order
or not?

Are they trained in the right way? Or
are they trained to hit and kick inno-
cent people? Shouldn't they be helping
us against trespassers of the law?

It seems that many of those people
are cowardly rather than brave, and
this is why they attack innocent
civilians rather than delinquents.

Whatever they do, apartheid will one
day be abolished and the racist, apar-
theid followers in our country, should
be given their own ‘homeland’ where
they can do their own things.

We are not against the different
forces, but we oppose their shocking
conduct towards citizens, and their
negative attitude towards the
maintenance of law and order.

They should remember that we are
all Namibians, and all human beings,
and all creatures of God.

Stop this type of behaviour and in-
stead look for better strategies tofight
racial oppression, discrimination and

apartheid.
