that their continved employment in

the Namibian ecanomy depends upon
their good behaviour towards Na-
mibia, the Governmers and the people.
They must conform to the will of

law-abiding citizens in thie country.
I also urge CDM to do away with
the ‘two-hospital' system - one for
the so-called migratory employees
in their own country and the other for
whites and ‘permanent’ employees.
The time has come to correct the
wrongs of the past.

On proper leadership

I WOULD like to comment on the |
pew organizations that have recently
been formed, namely, the TUN
(Teachers Union of Namibia) andthe |
NASEM (the Namibian Student
Education Movement).

Firstly, I would like to deal with |
the new student body. In regard to its
claims that it has been formed asa
‘‘seeutt of a leadership vacuum within |
the student community in Namibia"’ |
and, secondly, that the existing stu-
dent organizations have failed to

*‘proper leadership for
students because of their
Hoke with political parties’, I would
ttke to malice the following comments.

Eis no mirprise to me to read such

an atticle because this is the case and

THE NAMIBIAN

bean to mislead and infuse ideas of
the past colonial administrations. In
my point of view, the student! move-
ment has boon formed to foster the
interests and political ideals of their
respective political parties who are
at present on ‘death row’.

They see clearly that Nanso, which
has been a progressive student or-
ganization in the past, has won a
victorious fight against the regimo
thar illegally occupied our country, |
and which suppressed most of the
students and people of Namibia.

There was no leadership vacuum |
in Nanso. This can be proved by its
winning of the objectives it stood for.
Nanso members and supporters have
been harassed, detained and even
expelled from schools because of
their political beliefs and quest for
freedom. To say that Nanso has failed |
to serve student inferests, is mere |
bias. Nanso leadership succeeded in
mobilizing students all over the
country. It made them realize that
their interests were being suppressed
and needed to be fought for. Nanso’s
liberation standpoints, therefore, |
coincided with those of Swapo and |

|

Nantu.

Nanso could not isolate itself from
Swapo because they had common
goals to achieve. To fight a war in
disunity is to give the enemy victory
and therefore students needed to be |
linked in order to be free, get better
education, proper housing, and well-
equipped libranes, etc.

Nanso did not look for or concen-
trate on student issues alone, mainly
because the dignity of the whole naton
was undespinned by the colonial
regime. Asa student body consisting
of intellectuals, ithadtotake account |
of the socio-economic situation in °
the country. Students cannot only be
freo at school and ‘unfree’ when they

go home. Both students and their
parents needed to be liberated.
Tam assuring the leadership of the

this nation from foreign domination
and influence. I appeal to the new
organization not to create confusion
among students countrywide. We
know whose interests they represent
and promote. They must stop swim-
ming in the pool of confusion. Their |
organization was formed to counter-
act Nanso that has stood firm in
opposition to the abuse of bnman
rights.

My question to them is: if Nanso
failed to achieve what it fought for
and a leadership vacuum does exist,
then what have they achieved so far?

If you were serious, why didn’t
you form that organizatian months
ago, lo stand up against Koevoet
elements which used to disrupt les-
sons, beat up students, and erect army
bases al schools?

With regard the formation of the
TUN: it also has political motives in
their formation, which serve the same
purpose as that of the NASEM.

¢ organization has not been
formed to strive for teachers’ umity
and interests but to counteract Nantu.

Tappeal to teachers country wide to
be careful and cautious before join-
ing any altemative union which seeks
to divide the unity which already
prevails in our nation. They should
join the organizations who strive and
work for peace, nationhood and fra-
ternity.

Forward with progresnve people's
organizations.
