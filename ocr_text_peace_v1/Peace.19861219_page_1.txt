"THE ISSUE of the

} increase of water’,
and electricity in the Caprivi is
creating some division among the

for the interests of the majority, then
they can forget about cooperation and
peace of mind among the suffering
majority. |

I would therefore suggest that ir-
ritating things are done away with,
such aa the increase in

Yatea for water and electricity, with
purposeful disregard for the cost of
living; the withholding of workers in-
crements and the ineffective
maintenance work done in the
