they, including a confused Kozonguizi,
have already branded Swapo
responsible.

Why didn't the master of ceremony
at ‘Kandaha’ Dumeni’s funeral repeat
such soothing condolences from Sam
NujomaofSwaporather than wasting
time to read messages from those
nonentities? IfPienaar andde Wet can
heed Bishop Dumeni’s cal] on
February 27 and withdraw their South
African forces from Namibia and im-
plement UNSCR 435 this year, they
will be saved the energy of sending us
their unwanted condolences
emanating from deaths of such a
nature as on February 19.

I strongly believe in the message
from the Roman Catholic Church that
the Oshakati bomb massacre was a
devilish, rather than a divine will. If
that act was a Godly-premeditated
phenomenon, then God has betrayed
his own commandment ‘Thou shalt
not kill’, and has been incahoots with
enemies to kill innocent souls in the
ban.

Although it is hard to understand,
probably one should follow Bishop
Dumeni’s words of encouragement not
to despair but to trust that the
Almighty will one day crush the teeth
of the enemy and rid Namibia of hor- |
rendous deaths in bomb blasts.

May the Bishop and other bereaved
families be consoled. To the people of
Namibia, unity is strength against the |
bloodstained hands of Pretoria.
Namibia will one day explode with
laughter and peace and not with bomb
blasts.
