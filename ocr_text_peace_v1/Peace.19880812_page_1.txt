Message to you because of rumours of

peace.

My dear Namibiana, do you know
that there are eeven chief human
wanta in life? Theee are: air to breathe;
water to drink and for domestic pur-
poses adequate, wholesome and
nroriehing food; land on which to build
our houses; sufficient clothing to keep
us warm and enable us to conform with
accepted standards of decency; fire or
fuel to enable us to cook our food: and
a shelter to protect us from the sun,
wind and rain

If the Namibian nation is deprived
of these needs by a certain greedy
group of people, that greedy grouperrs
against God's will and against the
whole of humanity. So. no government
(nobody) has right to keep away these
natural wants from any individual
Because the youth of today 18 the future
generation, I think itis of paramount
importance for the youth of Namibia
to watch crntically and see if there is
any violation of these wants. If there

Tesistance our youth need to render? If
our air is being polluted. I feel itisthe

youth of Namibia to struggle and

History can prove that the struggle

My beloved youth of Namibia, do you
agree with me that the strugglo is over
the land in the first place? The im-
perialist governments are not in-
terested in Namibis because love
the Namibians They certainly donot
love us but they just fell deeply in love
with the land Namibia because she 1s
very rich. Now they are raping our
motherland. America, Britain, West
Germany and many other European
countries are more interested in
mineral resources our land produces
and not inthe Namibian people.

The South African soldiers and police
killed many Namibians because of the
land not because Namibianscommit-
ted any sin Tho youth must be aware
of this fact that they must struggle, not
for a sce of bread or a loafofbread, but
for the whole bakehouse. We muat free
the whole land of Namibia All evil
powers of colonialism and neo-
colonialism must be resisted. Col-
onialism is violance - oppression is
violence neo-colonialism isbribery or
betrayal which is also violence ands

these must be resisted. To revolt

does not mean cuy.mitting violence as
oppressors tendj.o put it. We revolt

Namubiana, stand upaod fight for your
rights - your country is your rights

Letusbe vigilant and not be confus

and stop the genuine process of the
struggle for freedom Some of us may
say: let us stop a bit and see what will
happen. | say no, because to stop “a bit”
while there is nothing really achieved
is hike putting a horse behind the cart.
Let uscontinue the struggle untilall
uur dreamsand visions become a reali-

Thisstruggle needs a young person's
prayer, mind, brain, energy. blood, tear
drop, and courage in order to achieve
freedom in totality. Thank you com-
