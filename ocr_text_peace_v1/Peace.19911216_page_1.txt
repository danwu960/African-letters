To policepersons

tiny and critkism. However,
accepting that ours is en im-
postant but difficult task, we
have to know whether we have
wronged and if, where. The
Government and the people
have to tell us. They also have
to inform us what they expect
from us. We - all members of
the Police know this - are ecr-
vants of the people and are
loyal to their Government and
thus have to conform to their
responsible and mature expec -
tations.

3. No member of the Na-
muibian Police ie in favour of
lalling or hurting people. We
know, however, that we have
to resort to violence unde:
certain circumstances.
circumstances include the
protection of life and property.
The police is equipped with
weapons (o use when the
circumstances warrant it. [tis
the Government which equips

| the police to enable it to func:

non effectively. Every mem-
ber of the police, however,
knows that there nught be an
occasion where he or sho has
to take a life or to hurt some
other person.

4. Every professional pol-
ceperson accepts the Rule of
Law and will defend the inde-
pendence of our Judiciary. No
policeperson doubts the integ-
rity of our courts of law. A
policeperson knows that our
constituhon guarantees every
person the nght of accesstoa
court. Thus it is clear that no
policeperson will eccept that
any person, individually or in
a crowd, has the right to take
the law into his own hands.

5S. Up to now, not one mem.-
ber of the Namibian Police has

- mand and that is to discredit

evidence proving that I am a
“political spokesman” (whaet-
ever that may mean), and not
with unfounded innpendo and
allegations. No policeman
would have such bith trust
and confidence in his Minister
and the Inspector General to
assume that they would toler-
ate somebody in the Nanubian
Police whois disloyal and who
1s acting 10 violation of policy

| apd instructions.

The person who prenteds to
be spealnng on behalf of
members of the Police, who
hides behind a pseudonym and
who questoans the integnty and
authonty of the Minister of
Home Affairs and the Inspec.
tor General of the Namibian
Police has only one aim in

this Government and its Police
which has to ensure peace,
stabilit; and secunty for all
people living in Nanmbia.
