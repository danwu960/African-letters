Land
conference

I WOULD like to publish this
j moble request in the name of
the fallen owners, heroes and
currently living heirs. May I
also have the privilege to shortly
dwell on the sad history of |
| Namibia. ,

Numerous volumes have
been written on the treachery,
robbery, murder and ultimately
the total colonisation of my
country. The Germans, some
boasting generations here, were
the first, followed by the South

Africans. In the present-day
independent Namibia the South
African and German colonial. |
ists here, misusing the
constitution and its contents, |
inter alia the socalled racon-
ciliation, are of the intent to
manipulate the Land Confer-
ence in their favour.

_ Sight should never be lost
that Namibia historically, cul-
turally and politically belongs
tothe San, Ovambos, Hereros, |
| Namas, Damaras, Caprivians. |
