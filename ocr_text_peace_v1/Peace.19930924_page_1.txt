Peace at last

a es a

PEACE has descended
py} upon Windhoek West

once again. The srudents

celebrated their ‘cul-
| tural’ festival and resi-
Gents were powerless tc
defend themselves from _
the onslaught. :

In case one is accused
of exaggeration, | am
talking about four nights
(I fell askeep by 3am) of
disco music blasting
| over the entire area -
_ | every syllable of every
| song trespassed closed

windows, locks doors,

earplugs - right into the
| furthest crevice of one’s
| | bedroom.

The police were also
powerless to restore
Peace because Vice-
Chancellor Peter
Katjavivi and Dean
Kandetu “had given their
permission”. Acomment
from the Minister of
Home Affairs would be |
appreciated on this point, :
Since when can two in-
dividuals muzzle the
police force from de-
fending peace-abiding
| cituzens?

A strange state of af-
fairs - Vice Chancellor
Katyavivi and Dean
Kandetu held control
over the police and the
Windhoek West taxpay-
crs, rate-payers, rent-
payers - those mere—
mortals who have to
work for a living.

The two University —
chiefs were indifferent |
to residents’ direct ap-
peals as well as police
wamings after the first
night's assault. This
could be due to several
reasons, all worrying:

- perhaps they had in
fact lost control;

- of perhaps they were
trying to ingratiate them-
selves with the students?
Very cheap!

- perhaps they consid- |
ered it an important les-
£0n in democracy for the
future leaders of our
country. Those privi-
leged students are more
entitled to rights than
workers.

Considering this was
not the first rowdy cam-
pus rumpus and thanks
to the two liberal univer-
sity heads, it will obvi-
ously not be the last, per-
haps Windhock West
rate-payers should de-

| mandareductioninrates |
due to a consequent de-

preciation of property in
] the area.
