‘Koevoetura’

OUR residential area, Katutura, is
nowadays patrolled nightly by

members of Swapol, better Sanit as
-‘Koevoet’.” i

While the idea of keeping an eye on
this area with a view to curbing
crime is acceptable, the consequences

of their presence here is such that

many people get assaulted
unreasonably.

In so doing the police are no longer
doing what they are supposed to do.

In a white residential area, no one
ever gets hit with a sjambok or blind-
ed by strong hunting lamps.

It makes one feel that Katutura is
nothing but a game reserve where
people go to ‘hunt’.

I would suggest that the police deal
more gently with the inhabitants of
this town, and if action is to be taken,
then let an arrest be made, rather .
than random assaults. The problem 7
-will not be solved by creating ag-.,.
