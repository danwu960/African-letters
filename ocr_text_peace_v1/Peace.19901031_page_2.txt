Keommanshboop on Tuesday October
23.

As always, President Nujoma, on
nis armival at the Keetmanshoop sta-
dium, captured the minds and spints
of all the people present. Especially
the schoolchildren were ecstatic as
President Nujomia passed the stand-
ing crowd to the stage.

The very first thing that struck him
was the quite obvious attitude of
pupils and teachers of the local white
schools. They were seated separately
from the pupils of the so-called black
schools.

The President immediately called
upon the pupils and the teachers of
the white schools tocome closer, and
mix with pupils of the other schools.
This call was welcomed with great
applause by the people present.

This practical gesture demonstrated
our President's seriousness with the
policy of reconciliation. He again
referred to the children as the future
leaders of Namibia. It is the pupils of
the pre-primary to secondary level
who must learn to live and play with
one another.

The speech by the President per-
sonally gave me hope for the future
and the efforts of our young govern-
ment. The optimistic manner in which
he facee his and our many challenges,
was reassuring, and we must pray for

lasting peace and stability in our
beautiful country.

Our President also proved that he
remains a man of the people, despite
his high position. It gave me great
Joy to see how humble and down: to-
earth he is.

At the end of his address, the Mayor
tried to restore order as the school-
children became so excited. Presi-
dent Nujoma gare them the rest of
the day off.

As] left the stadium I felt spintu-
ally satisfied. As I saw our lads started
to play soccer on the grass, I remem-
bered that 1t was also the 50th birth-
day of Pele, the worldâ€™s greatest soccer

- player.

Who knows, maybe one of them
will one day be Namibia's Pele, with
the opportunities and leadership that
are offered by our great President,
Sam Nujoma.
