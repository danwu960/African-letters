Good question

I WOULD like to share my con-
cerns with fellow Namibians con-
cerning the meaning of the phrase,
‘National Reconciliation’.

J would like anyone, who can pre-
cisely define the meaning of it, to
emphasise what its objectives are?

If know the meaning of ‘National
Reconciliation’, then we can more
easily establish peace, unity and
happiness among us.
