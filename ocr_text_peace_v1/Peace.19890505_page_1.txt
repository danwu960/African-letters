alld like to conclude with the
yotds of a Khomasda! College of
4° Education student: if you discrimi-
1 nate against my religion, I can change
it; if you discriminate against my
politics, I can alsochange; but if you
discriminate against the colour of
my skin - that ] cannot change.

Untag understrength

THIS letter was drafted for Untag
attention by the residents of northern
Namibia. The following are points in
the letter:

1. Restrict all SA forces to base.
With Plan fighters beyond the 16th
parallel, Untag must sec to it that
SWATE and SADF are disbanded. If
Plan combatants arc beyond the ] 6th
parallel, Untag must confine the SA
forces to Oshivelo and Grootiuntein

#6 stipulated in 435. We may not ne

recent investigations by C
Oshikuku. All investigations
atrociuies should be known to the —
public. On April 30, security forces
came out of bases and intimidated
people, tearing down NUNW plac-
ards. Letting the SADF from con-
finement doesn't give peace a chance.

3. Residents are compelled to put
on DTA T-shirts and give DTA signs.
What about democracy?

4. Residents here are threatened if
they demonstrate the black power
salute.

5. We need more Untag offices in
the north to facilitate contact by ci-
vilans. In this way contact with Untag
could be made easier.

6. Untag lacks contact with resi-
dents - they should talk freely to
them and this would solve immedi-
ate problems.

We call upon Untag to improve
and fulfill its responsible task,
