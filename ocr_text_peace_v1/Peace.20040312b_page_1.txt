Thanks To NBC

] WOULD like to publicly
thank NBC Radio in your
popular newspaper and
fearless news disseminator.
On Sunday morning, (7
March 2004) I was
surprised and excited to
hear an American Voice of
Islam, coming out ot NBC
radio. That was between
8h30 to 9h30. The program
was basically focussed on
the “Importance of
Conscience” in bringing
about God-consciousness,
when adhered to properly
by any criucal and nght-
thinking human beine.
The presenter, whospoke
with an American accent,
was talking about the
similarities between certain
Biblical and Quranic

statements on the issue of

conscience and God-
consciousness. AS oa
Namibian Muslim, [ was
naturally happy to hear our
national radio broadcasting

an Islamic message,
moderately, wisely and
scientifically presented. All
I wantto say ts: Thank you
very much NBC Radio!
On behalf of the Muslim
community in Namibia, |
would like tosay, you made
us feel athome and at peace
by broadcasting the etemal
Message of all God's
Prophets over our national
airwaves. For me it was the
first ume I listened to such
a program. It was, indeed,

enlightening, though, Pwas —

already famihar with the
contents. Continue
educating and informing
the nation, without fear or
favour. Proud of you, NBC
Radio and Lam happy to be
Namibian and Muslim!
Thank vou once again!

Peace
