Progressives should
combine forces

! WOULD LIKE to congratulate
the staff of The Namibian on their
success. Keep it up.

Secondly, | would tike to ex-
press my views with regard tothe
political situationin our country.

Namibia has become a politi-
cal object of the international im-
perialists, and itis essential that
we get rid of them.

consider mysett a progressive
and would like to encourage the
progressives in this country to
maintain and tighten the existing
cooperation among us, which
will lead to political unity.

We have a common identity
and common problems which we
Can only solve when we are polit-
leafly united.

Let us stop demanding minor
reforms like open hotels and
bers, and instead strive for total

and national Indepen-
dence of the Namibian people.

Let us also distance ourselves
trom our various political ideol-

ogles. Wecan pursue these after
Independence.

The South African Govern-
ment has embarked on a strate-
gy Of political intolerance and the
suppression of any opposition
from progressives. In order to
counter this, we have to combine
forces so that they give the
government to the peopte.

Let us unite in order to force
South Africa to relinquish her
colonial positionin Namibia. Our
compatriots in South Africa have
setusan example, andthe ques-
tion for us is ‘where is our UDF,
and who are the Boesaks and Tu-
tus of Namibia?’.

The time has come for us to
complete the circte in our strug-
gle against imperialism, tribal-
ism and colonialism.

We must not wait for anyone to
come to our ald. We must not be
demoralised by the MPC who
clalm to bring about peace and
national reconciliation. We have

seen how members of Koevoet
beat up our people in Katutura
and how Mr Dawid Bezuldenhout
called for the continued deten-
tlon of Josef Katofa. All these
deeds confirm the intention of
the MPC which is to silence
everyone who disagrees with
them.

My assessment is that the MPC
is the ‘strong arm’ of South Afri-
ca, used to further its colonialin-
terests in Namibia. The members
of the MPC do not represent the
Namibians but only their coloni-
al masijars.

People of Namibia, let us stand
up and show them we do not
need a further hijacking of our
freedom.

We have many peacetul ways
at our disposal by means of
which we can fight against the
system. Let us rally oursetvesbe-
hind our leaders to achieve the
freedom of this country, Let us
fight for peace, justice and anon-
exploitative society.
