Warren Butfet and Paul

N$156 billion. That 1s
more than the combined
GNP of the world’s 43
poorest countries - of
which some 600 million
live in sub-Saharan Af-
rica. It ts a figure that
almost defies belief.

It ts me for us, the

Our world. Capitalism
has had its day. Whether
run by the state (as in
the ex Soviet Union) or
left to the so called free
market, it clearly can-
not be made to work in
Our interests. And we

don't need Bill Gates

interests itreally works.

let us democratically
strip this parasitic mi-
nority of its exclusive
ownership and control
of the means of living.
Let us make this world
the common property of
everyone in it. Free off
the shackles of the mar-

Create a decent life for

Chaos At Kaudom

I HAVE just retumed from a visit to
Kaudom. I could accept the disintegrat-
ing facilities, the general devastation
and lacklustre attitude of the park offi-
cials. What] could notaccept was that at

lronically, at Etosha the previous week,
dirty linen was collected in the camp
with Land Cruisers!

This is insanity! No one checking?
