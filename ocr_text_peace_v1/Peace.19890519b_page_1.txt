Open letter

MAY 15 was International Con-
scientious Objector Day. On that day
we, the South African conscientious
objectors and their supporters remem-
ber prisoned objectors Ivan Toms
(currently out on bail) and David
Bruce and Charles Bester (both sen-
tenced to six years).

Central to their and our resistance
to conscription into the SADF is the
belief in the illegitimacy and unuust-
ness of the South African colonial
and military occupation of your coun-
try. In our campaigning over the years,
we have called for the right of con-
scripts not to be forced to do military
Service in your country. We have
also called for the implementation of
Resolution 435 as the way forward to
the demilitarisation of Namibia and
the establishment of a just peace
there.

While obstacles will still appear
along the way, the reality of inde-
pendence for Namibiais in sight. We
rejoice with you in the hope of anew

inni . We are glad to have played
Our small part in the struggle for a
free and independent Namibia. We
will join you in the celebration of that
victory,
