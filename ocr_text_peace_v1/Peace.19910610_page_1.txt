Transforming
society
| I GREET you ae
congenic sa friends back
hoene in Nemibla, from Ed-

Seotinnd, in the name

of pence and trues
ation. All of us at this end are

change have been oiled, ready
to tum and transform our soci-
cty in its writing of its own
history.

As we find ourselves envel-
oped in this vibrant situation,
brothers and sisters, we must
be careful that we do not create
a situation where privilege by
virtue of colour is replaced by
privilege by virtue of wealth
and whereby only the ‘haves’
enjoy the luxunes or creature
comforts while the ‘have-nots’
are forced to accept poverty as
their final destiny.

We who are govemed com-
rades must bear in mind that
our new Namibian nation re-
quires of everyone of us to be
a new person, with a new mind,
a new heart and a new spint. I
also believe that the hope for
Namibia does not just lie ina |
political system or with a spe-
cific government. it lies with
us, the people, black and white,
who have come through the
crisis and have had to change.
We need new minds, new hearts
and new spirits, hewn, as they
have been, from pain and
humiliation, from repentance
and forgiveness. Therefore we
must not expect our govermn-
meat to perform muracles while
we ourselves have not begun

the process of attitudinal change.
