Sanctions: Yes

THRE CALL tor total cconomic
sanctions against apartherd South
Atnica is justified. South Africa has
rejected all reasonable demands to
do away with the outdated and
degrading system of apartheid and
oppression of the blacks.

The promoters of economic
sanctions have the real interests of
the oppressed masses of South
Africa and Namibia at heart; and
economic sancuons is the alter-
native to total war. In fact
economic sanctions is a call for
‘peaceful change’ to enable the
blacks to govern in the land of their
birth and creation.

Those who are against economic
sanctions are only trying to protect
their own interests and exploitation
of the blacks. The claim that the
blacks would suffer if economic
sancuions were applied, should be
rejected with the contempt it
deserves. The blacks are suffering
already and additional temporary
suffering won’t matter to us as long
as freedom is achieved.

The blacks have no economic in-
terests to protect and defend - their
main interest NOW is to liberate
themselves at all costs.

The US and British attitude is
Clearly capitalistic and self-interest
aimed at protecting the in-
vestments. The fear of economic
loss is stronger to them than the
freedom and lives of the blacks in
apartheid South Africa. It ig
because of the double standards of
the Western powers that blacks
have lost interest in slogans like
‘democracy’ Blacks lived in peace
and harmony until the arrival of
the white settlers and colonisers.

It fills one with dismay to hear
about blacks saying that apartheid
is dead in Namibia. Apartheid in
Namibia as still alive and kicking,
even the socalled black ‘ministers’
complain about apartheid meted
outto them by secretaries of other
“Mintsters’,

The abolition of apartheid is not
what we are calling for - we are not
fighting for reforms - we want to
GOVERN this country. We are
fighting for the nght to decide our
own destiny and our destiny 1s not
linked to apartheid or neo-
colomalism.

The whites of this country are
not prepared to change or ready
themselves for change. They still
believe in their oppressive doctrines
und dogmas.

Even the Secretary for Finance
is calling for methods to prepare
against economic sanchons, instead
of calling for drastic changes in the
status quo in order to meet the
reasonable demands of the op-
pressed masses.

The whites must remember one
thing: they may be in a temporary
postion to delay independence. Dut
thes cannot present

The whites are shouting that they
ate Hehting on the border (o defend
them rotten sytem of apartheid.
They should femember that we
never invited them here with their
oppressive system, and now they
ure calling on us blacks to defend
and fight to retain oppression and
apartheid.

We hear that the army 1s 80 per-
cent black and 20 percent white -
but who are the 20 percent? They
are the elite, the white officers, the
ones in charge. The 80 percent
blacks are there only to run errands
and to be ordered to kill their own
kith and kin.

If the whites are prepared to die
for what is not theirs, what about
us who have a country to regain
and a people to liberate? Whites
should remember that violence
breeds violence - they have practis-
ed violence since the first white
man put his foot on Namibian soil
and have not stopped ever since. In
fact they have accelerated it. Blame
for any violence or bloodshed
should be placed squarely at the
door of the whites.
