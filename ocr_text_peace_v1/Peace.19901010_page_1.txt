Coup or no coup

IS that really the question?

At one time I believed very strongly
that whoever is responsible for the
Timea of Namibia editorially, has
somne sort of death-wish. I could just
act believe thet axrybody with a sane
sind could write or allow such mb-
bish to be wriftes as appears in the
petitical columns of tho Times. I
oven went to the extent of accepting,
which I still do, that that person went
eat ofhis way to provoke the govern-
meat into against the Times’
rund of ~ thus croating a
“maentyr out of him/her. How long

the democratic government will tol-

erate being belittied and called all
so 8s of names, 1s the question in the
mands of so many Namubians, and let
me assure the Times and DTA that
they are many.

I think now that the Times is cer-
tain that there 1s no action that will be
taken: there are even times when it
revertstonaked racism in its descrip-
ton of ‘black’ African countries, while
reference to South Africa creates the
impression of a docile dog creeping
with ifs tail betwoen its logs in front
of its master. Lest 1 deviate, let me
return to the issue 1 am writing about.

The belief that whatever deliber-
ately negative remarks or unfounded

[

accusations are made against the
govemment will force it to collapse,
borders on insanity. Boasting about
bnnging down the govemment singie-
handedly with such reports shock the
imagination of any human being. Itis
with this in mind that I read of the
‘Evidence on Namibian coup’ in the
October 5 edition of the Times.
The said newspaper reports exten-
sively on evidence given by Josef
Kleynhans, who told the court that
some people tned to recruit him fora
‘coup’ against the govemment. The
concept that itis only armiescapable
of staging coups, as repeatedly said
by the Times, is s0 ridiculous, but
their attempt to create the impression

that the arms theft was only a minor
‘adventure’, is, I fee] an attempt to
downplay the seriousness of the crime.
The thieves will finally, in the cyes
of the Times, be nothing more than
‘youths in search of adventure’.

I] hate to think what would have
happened if such a theft took place in
the previous dispensation and if the
‘adventurers’ were black and not white.

This comes after weeks of specu-
lation in tho same newspaper as to
whether there was really a coup plot
in Namibia or not. It is interesting, to
say the least, that this newspaper
should now have a headline report on
the coup. One wonders about this
paper's sense of journalistic ethics,
for in the past couple of weeks it
decried the coup story which was
broken by The Namibian as a ‘fig-
ment’ of that paper's imagination.

Now the Times of Namibia will
probably become the champion against
the coup. It seems to be trendy for the
Times to, on the one hand, deny the
existence of a coup and on the other
to be the first to report on evidence
given about it.

Whether one calls it an intended
coup or not, is purely academic. In

fact, the academio masturbation about -
coup or no coup does not impress the
majority ofNamiblans. Lat us at
tho facts: numerous arms .were sid
len, surely not to play ‘cowboys apd
crooks’, but to cause irreparable harm.
The simwas eurely to create havocin
Namibia.

Now tho opposition papers can
call it what they want, can even give
dissertations about ‘classical’ can- -
cepts of coups, but we, the Namibi- ‘
ans, know the arms were sjolen to
disrupt our hardwon independance
and democracy.
