injustice and colonialism are
today the people enjoying
the fruits of braveness.
ot Apart from those who have
sacrificed their lives for
national independence,
democracy and justice to
prevail, we have the limp-
w, «| ing injured ones who today,
ks | because of the war for na-
ate | tional independence and
6. | democracy, have lost some

a | parts of their bodies.
of The obvious questions
on | which suggest themselves
on | include whose responsibil-
e- | ity it 1S to succour these
h- | brave sons and daughters

for progress if our
constitution writers would
have dealt with the future
plight of the Plan freedom
fighters in depth.

A distinctive law or act
should have been put in place
to differentiate between the
nationalist fighters, the he-

because of their political
commitment and loyalty to
