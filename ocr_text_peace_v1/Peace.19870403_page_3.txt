What you did will not work, Ms Lister. You
forget that Col Radmore is not Christian Ac-
tion. You. forget that Col Radmore is a
disciplined Christian who does not hesitate
to acknowledge his strong belief in and love
for the Lord in public. You fail to appreciate
the fact that Col Radmore is one of the many
who knows what atrocious and senseless
terrorist deeds Swapo and their puppets
commit among the population. You, Ms
Lister, will possibly not be able to unders-
tand why a person like Col Radmore can be
outspoken for the Lord. You are seriously
mistaken, Me Lister, when you think that
through naive mudslinging against a per-
son, youcan cast suspicion on Christian Ac.
tion, amongst fellow Christians. There are
many Christians, Ms Lister, in this lovely
country of ours, who like Col Radmore are
genuine in their belief. Many are members
of the Defence Force, the Police Force, the
private sector, the state, businessmen, even
newsmen and women.

Ms Lister, you gofurther in your attempt
at casting suspicion by insinuating that
Christian Action could possibly be con-
nected with the Department of INforma.
tion. Forget these tactics, they don't work.
Christians have direction. They know what
the Lord expects of them, and they don't
need to be connected with anyone or
anything other than the Lord. We will sup-
port each other, and jointly we Christians,
irrespective of where we are, will fight Satan
in whatever form he may appear. Ms Lister,
you will be astounded to hear how many
members of Christian Action and other
Christians support this viewpoint, and who
differ with you in this respect.

Hundreds of people support Christian Ac-
tion, Ms Lister. Many, many Christians
havecontributed financially and otherwise
to enable Christian Action to reach out to
fellow-Christians to inform them who the
real enemy is, and to tel] how certain

and their puppets misuse the Bi-

ble and the Lord to promote their own idol
in a fashion foreign to our Christian nation.
