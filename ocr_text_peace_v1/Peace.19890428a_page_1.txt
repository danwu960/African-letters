Rumours are already going around
that the DTA are taking names from
graveyards; and what the intentions
are, only they know.

I appeal to the United Nations to
take care of those ballot boxes in
order to rule out the possibility of any
irregularities. Please ensure that the
South Africans do not handle the
boxes alone.

Mudge and Kaura

. THEDTA Chairman Dirk Mudge,
saust clean his pwn house before he
| -ooks at those of others. We see DTA

- for reconciliation. We notice that the
DTA has chosen to fight against Swapo
rather than South Africa, which has
occupied the country formany years.

Mudge has also been making ac-
cusations about atrocities in Swapo
settlements, something he has no
evidence of. Yet he and his sapport-
ets appear to have Koevoet at their
disposal, who are the culprits as far
as atrocities in Namibia are con-
cerned. Mudge and Kaura are not
happy to see a Namibian nation
marching to freedom. They appear to
be perpetrating tribalism and divi-
sion among the people of this coun-

A few weeks ago K aura was inter-
viewed on the BBC where he claimed
that Swapo leaders were provoking
his supporters and he warned about
‘fights’ which may erupt in Katu-
tura. He also wamed Swapo leaders
that their safety may be jeopardised
if such ‘fights’ break out.

The anti-Swapo propaganda being
carried out by the DTA is the reverse
of the wuth. We have evidence that
the DTA is doing the very things they
accuse Swapo of.

Dirk Mudge and Kaura must real-
ise that in Swapo, they are dealing
with amovement whichis politically
mature. Swapo is not interested in
bringing Namibians into conflict or
the county into neo-colonialism, as
the DTA is doing.

Mudge and Kaura must control
their supporters not to provoke peace-
ful Swapo supporters any longer.
Swapo supporters do not interfere
with the affairs of other groups. Let
us campaign peacefully for the elec-
tions without intimidating anyone.
Mudge and Kaura must know what
the consequences of civil war is - that
is, if they have ready history. We in
Namibia do not want such a situation
here. Our people have suffered for
too long and they need peace and
freedom, which Swapo has and still
stands for.
