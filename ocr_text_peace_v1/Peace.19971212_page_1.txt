ITAKE this Opportunity to challenge the Pente.
costal churches to come out and confess to the
Namibian nation for Collaborating with the apart
heid regime.

These churches supported the
kime directly while cl

apartheid re-
minded and non- polity

miming to be heavenly-
cal.

Some of their members voted
that supported the apartheid repr

Ing Swapo as communist and satanic. Why then
mark others while the SA government which

they supported committed the most horrible
acts?

for the parties
me while brand.

It has now become a habit in Namibia that
these churches just decide to hold their church
services right in front of your house, whether
you hke itor not. They have no consideration
that there may be students studying forexamina-

Hon, old people or persons working might shitts
cle.

Tam not condemnin

& what they are doing and
l suppor them for bringing the g00d news to the
lost and the necdy.

Why do they concentrate
mostly on the black and coloured townships?
Why are the whites left out?

Are the whites in Olympia and Pionierspark
novin need of Jesus Christ? ] want to see a black
Person with cnough guts to rick telling a white

person, “You need Jesus Christ in your \ife'™,
In fact, | was told b

y a colleague that this very
Same group of people were about to preach ina

Cerain white residential area but was told by the
police to stop immediately or face the charge of
“disturbing of peace’.

Jesus Christ came to preach to everyone, red

Breen, yellow, nch and poor. Take up this chal
lenge and get ted of the colonial mentality
