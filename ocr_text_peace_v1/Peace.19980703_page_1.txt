I started this paper by saying Nujoma should go
and not have a third term. Why? The regime that I
have descnbed here is HIS. He is the President! He
has the power to change through dismissal, effec-
uve reshuffling of his cabinet, caforcemen of
policy, maintaining political serutiny of his politi-
cal employees (the Ministers, Deputies, PSs etc).
He had almost eight years to prove that he is not
only from Kahao, but from each part of the coun-
try. That instead of constructing a tarred road to his
own homestead, he coulc have constructed one to
Hosea Kutako's homestead as a gesture of revols-
tionary appreciation and unselfishmess. |: :
