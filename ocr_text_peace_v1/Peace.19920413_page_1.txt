Enemy of peace

AS a patriot and 4 democrat, I

would like to respond to Dr
Petrus J Krige’s letter which
appeared in The Namibian on
April 3.

First I would like to make it
clear that the policy of na-
tional reconciliation was unani-
mously declared asa national
policy and not only the Presi-

tions have to make sure that
the policy goes deep into the
roots of this country and is
clearly understood by all citi-
zens. This is the task of every
Namibian. For that matter, Dr
Knige is not only against the
prevailing atmosphere in this
country, but he is also against
its independence, as such he is
an enemy of peace and justice.

There is no one in this coun-
try who would support his line,
except perhaps a few friends
who are suffering from the same
disease.

When we talk about recon-
ciliation, we mean business,
and we do not judge people by
colour, sex, political affiliation,

ideological differences or be-
liefs.

Tt is untrue to say that the

Government of Namibia does
not allow judges and sport
participants from South Af-
rica while it allows imports
from the same country. J think
you are joking, and are obvi-
ously not a Namibian. If you
are, then you don’t need to get
a job, but re-orientation and
attend lectures to familiarise
yourself with what is happen”
- ing in Namibia. You must be
the first ignorant intellectual
in Namibia.

Regarding culture, the Gov-
ernment of Namibia is ademo-
cratic one, and I can assure you
that it doesn’t limit rights and

freedoms as you maintain. .

Everyone has the nght to en-
joy his or her cultural heritage
provided that this is in keeping
with article 19 of the
Constitution of Namibia.

I think that his theory is
misleading, if not inciting hatred
among Namibians. Since you
are a doctor in musicology,
maybe you need a medical
doctor to cure you of the dis-
ease called a superiority com-
plex and your racism. It is a
pity we still have people in this
country who are anti-progress

dent or Government institu- .

and anti-nation building.

Are you also saying that
Namibians are unable to do
administrative work? And are
you saying that Namubians
should not be appointed to high
positions? I believe that all
Namibians, irrespective of
colour, should have equal
opportunities and be able to
run state machinery. Don’t
underestimate the abilities of
Namibian people, sir. It is not
only foreigners who can do
these jobs.

Neither should you insult our
national anthem. ‘Freedom
fight” has no undesirable or
negative connotations. It is only
your ignorant, anti-democratic
and racist sentiments. Who are
the Namibians who live inside
the country who don't share
the same sentiment regarding
this? You are an autocrat and
cannot talk on behalf of demo-
crats. Who gave you the man-
date to do so?

J don’t think you can pre-
tend not to know why Swapo
opted for the armed struggle.
There is hardly anyone, even
non-citizens of this country,
who do not know, this.

‘You are not only against —

Swapo as the ruling y party, but

also against the Namibian .

people. You do not even honour
people who sacnificed their lives
for the cause of this country
and now you want to be given
a job, probably as a director,
because you think you are the
best and only musicologist in
this country.

I feel sorry for you sir. Be-

sides musicology, you appear
to be totally empty politically.
National reconciliation is our
policy and if you don’t like it
you should go to a place where
there is no peace and justice,
since you want the policy tobe
reversed. Think twice, sir, and
learn from your mistakes.

Prison problems

IT IS not easy to work at
Windhoek Central Prison where
Namibians do not enjoy the
same rights as others in this
country. Many African Namibi-
ans at this institution feel as
though they are working with
the colomialists still.

It therefore goes without
saying that there is hidden
racism in our Republic, and
things are often being run by
people who are in leadershir
positions. It seems some 0
them are placed there to pro
mote Enropean domination, an
promotions are only given |
members who sympathise wi
or advocate white Europe
supremacy. Lee
