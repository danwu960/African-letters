Of breaking the colonial and apert-
heid laws.

_ SWAPO, who led the struggle for
freedom, broke through this apathy
and fear. We gave active expression
to the universal longing to be free.

Our leaders strenghten the peoples’
faith in themselves, and encourgac
them to take part in the freedom
struggle.

I am convinced the unity of the
Namibians outweigh those who di-

Who's monitoring

Which is the monitoring force.

UNTAG or the South African Army?
1. It looks as if Mr Ahtisaari can-
not refuse or argue any request or
move put forward by the South Afn-
can government
1.1 After the security force at-
tacked the PLAN-fighters on April,

he allowed the South African ermy to
leave their bases for a large attack on
SWAPO fighters.

1.2 After the confinement of the
South African troops to their bases
for 60 hours, we find they had al-
ready left the bases before the des-
ignated 06h00 on April 29. They
started to fire allert shots during the
whole night of the 28th. The UNTAG
forces in the north will agree with
me. From 02h00 on the moming of
the 29th their Casspirs and Rattels
were on the road.

Why do they have to monitor the
withdrawal of the SWAPO fighters?
Will SWAPO fighters do the same
when they withdraw? What is the
UNTAG force doing here?

2.So many Koevocypolice are
deployed and moving around m
Northern Namibia in their Casspirs
amongst the people. Why don’t they
stay at their police stations? Is it
because because there is no room for
all of them? The whoke KOEVOET
was just give thename ‘police’. Why
keep such a big police force? Is is just
to distribute DTA pamflets, helping
in their campaign as they did on
April 29 at Othingo, on the west of
Oshakati and elsewhere?

3.Does Mr Ahtisaari know that
South Africa is doing all this to vio-
late Res 435? Does he know thar
South Africa wants to waste time
unt no more time is left and they
will come up with requests to with-
draw the peace plan?

4. For years, rears, South Afrioa hae tokd
us that the people of Nemibla will |
decide on their future. It does got
