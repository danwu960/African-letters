Namibian hero

-I WISH to honour the fallen hero, Im-
manuel Shifidi, who gave his life for
his motherland.

He was killed at the Swapo rally j in
Katutura on Sunday and he died a
peace-loving hero.

The best homage we Namibians
can render to the immortal memory
of Immanel Shifidi is to strengthen
vigilance at all levels of the struggle.
The enemy killed the lion of â€˜our
struggle, but the next day the sun
rose up, which means the enemy can
kill us but they will not stop our
march to the Promised Land.

We appeal to our enemy once
| again. One day we will cross the river
{| of hatred and brutality, and one day
the bright dawn of liberation will rise
in the dark shadows of slavery and
oppression.

Resolution 435 should be im- |
plemented to terminate the bloodah-
ed in this country. Our struggle
needs effective action - the unifica-
tion fo all Namibians. |
