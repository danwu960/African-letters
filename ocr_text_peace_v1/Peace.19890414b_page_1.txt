Gave their lives

AS ONE of the greatest fans of
your newspaper, allow me to air my
views conceming the recent clash
between Swapo combatants and South
Afncan security forces.

First of all, I take my hat off to
those freedom fighters who gave their
lives for us to be free. (Not only
them, but for South African security
forces who didn’t know what they
were doing, may God forgive them).
When I think of those who died, my
blood mins cold. Freedom was so
near and yet so far for them.

Secondly, the members of the UN
who were in favour of the reduction
of Untag from 7500 t0 4650, should
now bow their heads in shame. What
&@ great mistake it was.

According to eyewitnesses, the
security forces fired against the
combatants first. AndI believe them.
One may ask why? Because I cannot
believe someone, who, for 70 years,
has made me a subject of the evil
system called apertheid.
pepe pre Swapo. Why?

blamed because
fought beck in self-defence? Orie
because the US end its allics call

Swapo a ‘terrorist’ organisation?
Swapo is a liberation movement and
we are proud of it. According to
international law and the UN Char-
ter, we have the right to resist South
Afican occupation.

The Untag forces were supposed
to secure peace. Where were they?
The Botha’s are making fools of them.
The UN is now experiencing what we
have experienced for many years.

The Swapo combatants were re-
grouping to be confined to bases
when the security forces fired on
them. Who gave that instruction?
Botha or Ahtisaari?

Last but not least: Untag gives the
green light to South Africa to re-
deploy Koevoet and 101 Battalion to
assist them in their peacekeeping task.
Will a child's heart ever forget who
killed his mother? Will amother ever
forget who raped her ten-year-old
daughter? Some may forgive, but
they will never forget.

We will continue to resist our
occupation: Europe tasted Nazi oc-
cupation and opposed it. We have the
right to do the same.
