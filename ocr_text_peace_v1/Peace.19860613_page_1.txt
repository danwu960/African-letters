Racial purity?

AN OPEN LETTER TO
MR SAREL BECKER
AND FOLLOWERS

OVER THE years, when apartheid
was in its raw stages, it was mark-
ed with doors for ‘Whites only’.
‘Whites only’ could enter these
doors, regardless of their religion,
social standing, tradition or race.

The only precondition was that
the skin colour be ‘white’.

The man with the black skin had
to keep away from ‘your’ regions
and reservations.

1 will not ask what you have
against the colour of my skin, Mr
Becker. By maintaining this rigid
attitude, you have made your
message clear to the blacks of
Namibia. As far as you are con-
cerned, there is no compromise on
apartheid without a colour change.

ironically, the very segregation
you are now seeking, was provid-
ed in the past. Someone was wise
enough to foresee conflicting
nature of the white man and black
man, and kept them apart. Your
forbears were in Holland and there
the chances of keeping vour race
pure, were perfect

On what grounds can you now
fence in the black man to safeguard
the punty of your white race if you,
yourself, have broken the natural
segregation by crossing the ocean?

Of course we dare not overlook
the fact that your forbears brought
the first hight of Christian faith and -
civilisation into the most southern *
part of Africa. This opened our
eyes (o new horizons of education,
civilisation, faith and progress.

Incidentally, the white man also
introduced to us the first spark of
the gun, the very evil he suffers
under today. In fact the mass
slaughter of blacks on December 16
1836, is a testive day for your
government - contrary to the Chris-
Han faith which strives for peace,
love and unity.

You came to Africa, heavily
armed and with apartheid.

Surely you are an advocate of
‘whites only’ churches, a religion
practised, understood and accep-
(able to only a small part of the
community. With the help of God
we have partly outgrown that stage.

Lastly Mr Becker, your thoughts
Jo not justify your existence in
Africa, unless you change them
and bring them into the open. —
