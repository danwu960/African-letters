Meaning of peace

IN THE WAKE of Christmas and my
dealings with The Namibian during
1987 I fee) myself competled to write
you this letter in my personal capaci-
ty in order toset the record straight on
the real meaning of the words peace
and goodwill.

After an in-depth study and research
on the reporting as presented by The
Namibian during the past year | come
to the conclusion that no objectivity
was portrayed by your newspaper con-
earning the South West Africa situa.
tion. Instead, you tried to portray the
enemy, Swapa including all tts wings
and associates as the “peace-seekers”
Nowhere could I find a call to stop ac.
tions by these organisations which are
detrimental to our country and all its
inhabitants, such as boycotts,
sabotage, etc. No, you rather opted to
go for the “alternative view’ of
revolution.

Let me give you only one example:
Justabout every week some kind of ac-
trocity by the security forces was
reported. The security forces spelt 1ot
out clearly that no atrocities by
members of the security forces
would be tolerated. Members who
are found guilty by a court of law will
be punished accordingly. However,
when Swapo claimed responsibility for
the bomb blast at the Gustav Voigts
Centre you reported it to be “a
demonstration of Namibian people's
resolve to shake off the yoke of col-
onialism by all necessary means”. Is
this promoting peace and goodwill?

Swapo opted for the revolutionary
methods some 21 years ago and let us
be honest, they've lost face, both
militanly and politically Although
you portray this organisation tobe the
“true liberatora” of this country, |
guarantee that freedom will be
something of the past IF they should
take over the reins. Howevar, that ia
hardly to be foreseen.

In you socalled “bumper edition’
dated December 18, 1987, to January
8, 1888, you predict another year of war
in your ’polstical perspective” column,
however, in the same breath you cal!
upon organisations and individuals
“to re-agsesa and come up with a con-
crete and effective plan of action to
break the chains in 1988 andreachthe
goal ofa free Namibia’ Thus, 1 accept
that you areatthesametime wishing
for peace and war. This isa contradic.
tion I'll never be able to understand

Please keep in mind: Swapo opted for
war. This is what they got. The securi-
ty forces were in being long before the
existence of Swapo and if you look at
the aim of any defence force in the
world, you will notice that their duty
{s, amongst other, the safeguarding of
life, property and freedom, During

1988 the security forces will maintain
this aim!

May | wish you not a worldly “hap:
py ‘festive season, but my prayers are
that you may also experience the love
of God towards mankind manifested
through the birth of His Son, our
Saviour and Lord, Jesus Christ, in
whom we trust to build the future of
this beautiful country with all its
inhabitants

NOTE: Don't talk absolute rubbish,
Commandant. You should know
better. An in-depth study and
research of the reporting in The
Namibian, and frequent, virtual
weekly reports of security force
atrocities (on your own admission)
should be telling you something.

You would prefer, obviously, that
because the Defence Force has
stated that “no atrocities by
members of the security forces will
be tolerated”, that we should not
report them at all. 1s this what you
define as ‘objectivity’? While on
thesubject, perhaps youcouldtell
ue how many members of the
‘secunty’ forces appeared incourt
for atrocities, and how much, in
claims of compensation, has been
paid out by the military tomembers
of the civilian population in the
past year? We wonder whether you
even keep euch statistics.

Interesting too, to see that you
classify Swapo aa “the enemy”, and
amall wonder ‘security’ forces
target civiian members of the
population who supportthe move.
ment. Have you forgotten that you
are apparently fighting against the
People's Liberation Army of
Namibia (PLAN), and not Swapo,
which is a legitimate and legal
political organisation tn this
country?

The Namibtan neverclaimed the
bomb blast at the Gustav Voigts
Centre was a ‘demonstration of the
Namibian people's resolve to shake
off the yoke of colonialism by all

necessary means”. Your assertion
in this regard is entirely without
factual basis.

The'security’ forces inthis coun-
try have not maintained the aimof
“safeguarding of life, property and
freedom" as you claim. Quite the
contrary, in fact.

And since you have the temerity
to talk about spreading the “love of
God”, perhaps you could explain to
us why a socalled ‘Chrietian’
defence force commits such ‘un-
Christian’ actions and why the ma-
jority of Christiansinthis country
call for the withdrawal of your
defence force? - Gwen Lister.

SADF answer call
Dear Editor

Your comment: latest act of sabotage

1. It iy not normal procedure for the
SWA Territory Force toseek comment
from a newspaper, however, in the light
of your openly anti-SWA Territory
Force cam paign, we feel it necessary to
ask your commenton the incident on
Saturday, December 19 1987, at Pep
Storea.

2, If this act of sabotage would have
been successful. hundreds of people
could have been either dead or maim-
ed or seriously injured. It was only the
grace of God that saved South West
Africa of a disaster, initiated by a ter-
rorist who obviously has no feeling for
human life If, and we are sure they
will, Swapo claims responsibility for
this senseless deed, will it be portrayed
again as ‘an act to demonstrate the
will of the people to free themsel vea
from colonial rule’?

3. We trust that The Namibian witl
react to this in order to show exactly
where it stands.
