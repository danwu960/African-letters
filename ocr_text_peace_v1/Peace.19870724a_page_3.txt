vote election. Therefore population
planning as a form of imperialistic,
capitalistic, racial suppression, has no
logical or scientific basis.

With the present growth curve,
demands on health, housing, food,
education andemployment, are in ex:
cess of supply, and the situation is
worsening. Demand greater than
supply boosts inflation, whichinturn
aggravates poverty even further. It is
a vicious cycle. Only a firm political
statement of intent and action, can
break this cycle. It will require a brave
man to doit, but if successfull, he will
go down in history as the man who
brought progress and prosperity. Peo-
ple will become independent of, rather
than dependent on the State.

B) Farming Methods:

Farming methods must become scien-
tificand conservative. Namibia is vir-
tually only suited to livestock and
game farming. The delicate ecological
symbiosis must be nurtured for future
generations.

C) Political Settlement

’ (AG8 and Resolution 435):

The guerrilla war can only be ter-
minated by a political settlement. It is
often said that Namibia must decide
its own future, but to most who have
followed the political yo-yo game, it is
obvious that outside sources from a
number of sides are manipulating our
future. A settlement will hopefully
bring peace, stability, investment and
prosperity.

D) Good Medical Services:

Good medical services must gohandin |
hand with education and economic ©
progress.

E) Political Independence:

Political independence depends on
economic independence. Namibia’s
resources must be developed by Nami-
bians for Namibia, with help if
necessary. Presently symptoms and
not causes are treated. This only
postpones a solution until it becomes
insurmountable.

Man has been able to control all
other formsofliebut not himself. One
of the few people still inharmony with
nature is the Kalahari bushman. He
sets anexcellentexampleofliveand let
live, unlike the suicidal lemmings of
the Antarctic.

You don't help a poor man by giving
him a fish, but by showing him how to
catch a fish. The aim should be in-
dependence not hand-out nurtured
dependence.
