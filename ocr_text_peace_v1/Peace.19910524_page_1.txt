Jobs at NBC

I would like to air my gnev-
olties at the NBC and I want to
confirm the statement made
by Kakeds ka Nangula in The
Namibian dated May 13 in
which it was eaid that outside -
trained broadcasters are most
affected by the policy of na-
tional reconciliation.

In 1990 I contact the Minss-
try of Information and was told
that the Ministry did not re-
cruit people but that this would
have to be done directly through
the NBC

I would lke to appeal to the
Minister totake this matter up.
Perhaps he could exert pres-
cure on the NBC to connder
already trained retumees for
jobs at the Corporation, rather
than appoint new people.

Lact year there were several
bursanes sponsored by the NBC
and there were many newly-
recruited people involved
