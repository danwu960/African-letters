Atraid of liars

IN Oshiwambo there is a proverb
which says: Omufundji oku vule
omulodhi. It means a har is worse
than a witch. The saying continues: It
is better to accomodate a witch than
a lier.

Lhave been baling to understand
the proverb of my ancestors. My
question has been, why did they look
upon liars with apprehension? (1 pould
be happy if someone could give fur-
ther clarification).

For many years we have been oul-
side our beloved motherland - parted
from our parents, sisters, brothers,
friends and comrades. We havc al-
ways becn dreaming of home.

It also pasned us when we were
told that some of our relatives or
fnends penshed in the bloody 23.
year war. Therefore, we understand
what it meant when some of our
fellow compatnots were told that
their nextof kin were ‘eliminated’ by
Swapo. These lics have caused
immense damage and confusion.

Maybe our ancestors were afraid
of liars because what they said did
not only affect a limited number of
people, but the entre population. A
witch destroys only one or two poople,
and then that is the end.

When liars speaks of death, they
mean life; when they speak of de:
mocracy, they mean tyranny, justice
= injusucc, reconstruction = destruc-
tion, freedom = oppression or captiv-
ity, decolonisation = colonisation,
freedom from South Afnca = de-
pendence on South Afnca.

These are the people who nearly
destroyed the Namibia peace process
by concocting lies that Swapo com-
batanis infiltrated Namibia on Apni
1, while many of them had been in-
side already.

Lies were fabricated again when it
was reported that Swapo combatants
were moving south of the sixicenth

bel to prepare for a big incursion
into Namibia - an absurd statement
indeed.

The Namibian peopie are stil! wit-
messing more lies from the enemy of
the Namibian people in its avowed
efforts to deny Swapo a two-thirds
