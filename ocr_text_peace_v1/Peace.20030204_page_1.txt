was prepanng to bomb Afghanistan, |
said that if tic. acre allowed tw pro-
ceed with the bombine it » ould become
a precedent to attack any nauon if they
have reason to do so.

I want to appeal to al! peace loving
people in the world to oppose this war
by all means. The West always propa-
gated the idea of mediation and dia-
logue to resolve conflicts but they are
failing to uphold this principles.
America should learn from Namibia,
which has demonstrated the ability of
resolving conflicts through dialogue and
by respecting internanonal law. We have
maintained peace, stability and progress
despite threats from Unita rebels,
Caprivi secessionists and other nega-
tive elements such as criminals.

America should stop thefr plansied”
attack on Iraq. They failed during the
Gulf war to defeat Saddam and they are.

cent people who are going to be caught-
up in the centre of a war that does not
really concem them. We all know what
the Americans are after - the weapons of
mass destruction they claim are in Iraq
have not been found by UN weapons
inspectors. The Americans want to test
their mew weapons on Iraq. | always
wonder why they are so afraid of these
weapons when they are the ones who
started to produce them. We know that
they are after the rich oil fields of Irag

‘and nothing else.

History is repeating itself like the
colonialists who came to claim our re-
sources by the use of force! It is in their
wealth but this time they are surely
going to fail!
