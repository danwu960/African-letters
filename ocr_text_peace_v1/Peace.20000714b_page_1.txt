I shall hereby trv and sketch to Mr Daa fiow the Buster
people have come to ulumutely settle ithe Rehoboth ot
today Foam not sure whether Mr Dax can grasp to
fustoncal lacts that Pam vorny lo present but thatis not
any problem During the startofthe 19th century both the
Nama and the Baster people who sprang from cach
other's foins, felt the bad adnunistration of the Cape
colonial government Together they decided to look for
salvation across the Orange River and outside the reach
ol the Cape colonial povernment: There were many
Steams ever mos cop necthe ards hutthe main ones were
the name proups of Wotboor Afmkaner end others
Voxether with them were the Busters under Kapton
Hermanus van Wyk heading northwards while another

Previously the Rehoboth Mission was infiubited by
the Swartboor Nama clan, but by the tine tic Basters
amved, they had abandoned the area for Ogimbingwe
because they were involved with conflicts with Jan
Jonker Afnkaner.

The Basters never took land or anything clse from
anybody in Namibia. The Rehoboth area where they
first settled was totally unoccupied and an open area
devoid of Nama or Hereros. Numencally it was also

Upossble tor small clans like the Swartieans ead
others to hase occupied un urea the size of the onginel
Rehoboth setiet In spite of this, Kaptern Von Wye
Made apreements with Samuel Maherero, Jan Dlaonolh wg
aerial and others to ensure the Peaceful como isto
of the Basters with thei unmediate Herphbours

Since the Busters were of mixed ongin, all ot them
spoke mainly German, Dutch and Nama And thes

preferred to give Nama names to their farms, names that
still exist today
