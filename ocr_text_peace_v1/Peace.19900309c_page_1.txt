yourselves. There are always two sides.
The one who gets oppressed, and the other
who allows i to happen.

Namibians have suffered a lot and they
struggled 10 be free. Now let all Namibians
be free. Try to become open and tolerant of
every group in our society.

Troe freedom is that everybody can do
what he or she wants to do, as long as il
does not hurt or harm any other person.
This is my personal guideline.

A big headache

THE opporunists among Namibians
-could cause a big headache for our future
government,

It seems to me thal most white Namibi-
ans with an opportunistic nature are those
in the ‘pnvate business sector’ and blacks
are mostly former members of SWATF,
particularly 10] Battalion.

It is sad, and at the same time logical,
that some of the 101 former soldiers are
not prepared to terve their country in a
new Namibia defence force, domanding
same of mora money than they got
tha colonial regimes.
this ls ‘Logical’ to me is because if

they were not opportunists they would
have refused to jom enemy forces in the
‘first place.

What salaries were paid to our Namib-
ian heroes, Swapo Plan combatants who
fought for so long to liberate Namibians
from the oppressive South African re-
gime, including the SWATF members?
Do they feel no shame?

If they were in Romania they would
serve life sentences or be executed by
firing squad. If they think they can get
more money elsewhere, they are free lo
look for better paid jobs.

It is their democratic nght to say no.

As far as | know Namibians there are
cnough men and women who are ready at
any lime to secure our freedom, to guard
our borders and protect our peace and
defend our democracy, filled with a spirit
of reconciliation and forgiveness, willing
to work and serve the new-borm Namibian
nation.

Long live Namibian patnots!

Anti-toxic waste

| WOULD like to respond to the article
in the edition of !5 February entitled
‘Namibia ideal for toxic storage’.

By reading the headline alone # be-
comes questionable as to whether the au-
thor and whoever shares his views really
have the interests of Namibia at heart by
advocating and cven promoting this de-
structive idea of dumping nuclear wale
on our soil, for whatever reason.

He argues further that this will provide
employment for Namibians. Who on earth
would accept a job that means digging his
orherown grave, however much they are
psid to do s07

Not even a a fool would do that. The
author speaks of protection, If there is
protection, thén why would anyones want
to dump those poisons in our country and
not ajmply in the countries where they are
