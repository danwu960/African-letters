I WOULD ke to reply to the letter
"Unfair to aliens’ of October 2, by
‘Fed-up Alien’. It is clear from the
detter that the anonymous writer suf-
fers from racism. My concem here,
however, is to put the matter right.

First and foremost, I hope the writer
is aware that every country has a law
relating to ‘aliens’, ‘foreigners’ and
‘illegal immigrants’ or whatever one
prefers tocall them. Such laws serve
a number of purposes. First, they
protect the security of the country.
Second, to keep a record of aliens in
the event of a population census.
Thirdly, to enable law enforcement
machinery to effectively control border
traffic.

In response to your letter, it is my
opinion that many foreigners who
came to Namibia in the past five
years did not do so because they
loved Namibia. Neither did people
from South Africa come here be-
cause they did not agree what was
happening there. After all, at that
time the same things were happening
in both countries.

If they thought what was happen-
ing in South Africa was wrong, they
should have stayed and applied their
“skills and experience’ to exert pres-
sare for change. However, these
‘skilled’ people preferred to come
and tale of the brou
shout by the ‘orkilled labour" of
Namibia.

The government must adhere to
the constitution, which is the su-
prom law of the land. It applies to

' @veryone, whether govemment
omptoyee or not, or whether black,

white, Asian, or African.
‘The govenument cannot give citi-
pots any foteignercisiming

foreigners arrived here for different
reasons. Many of them were not
genuine. Is it not surprising to you
that most people involved in dia-
mond smuggling, rhino and ivory are
foreigners?

You claim that ‘aliens’ and ‘South
Africans’ are the only people with
skills. Many South Africans here came
because they could not be absorbed
in the South African economy. They
did not all come here with skills and
experience - the colonial policy was
to provide job opportunit#s here for
those people at the expense of the
Namibians. Namibia has been used
as a laboratory for upgrading and
training South African unskilled
labour.

The people who yame back from
exile are Namubiaiccitizens. They
were bor here and their parents and
relatives are here.

They were fighting for the inde-
pendence of this country and are
fully qualified as citizens.

We do not see many signs of the
skilled’ the ‘unskilled’ here.
Thope you will take the lead.

You cannot claim to be patriotic to
one country while dual citi-
zenship. ‘Fed-up Alien’,.the south-
ern borders are open.
