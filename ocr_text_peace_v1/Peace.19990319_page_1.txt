Is To Be Done?

__Swapo Has Lost Its Vision For Namibia

TO us young people of

this country during the

years of the 1960s and

1970s, Swapo sy mbolised
the mage of equality. jus
tice and freedom for all
the people of Namibia

The prevailing situation
then was one of oppres-
sion, denial of justice and
human rights for the
greater Majority of the
black and coloured popu
lation of our lund There
acre laws rastituted such
as job resers ations, Bantu

farrly. Jt was a vision
where no one tnbe would

Nason where all
Namubians live in peace
and tranquillity, where no
Namibian would again be
a political refugee or flee
their homeland because of
politcal intimidation and
tear

It was because of this
common vision that the
support for Swapo was so
broad among the Nami-
bian people. It was be-
cause of this common vi-
sion that the support for
Swupo was unwavering.
For many it was a vision
for which they were pre-
pared to sacrifice their
fnends, family and posses-
sions.

For many others it was
a vision for which they
wese preparcd to lay
down their lives. For
many today, however, the

shining vision of Swapo
has become a great disap-

Pointment. Vow muany Unies
vision thes shattered.

Why?

In simpke terms. Swapo
has for the past cight ycars
that it has been in poltucal
power in Namibia, done
nothing but emulate all the
evils of the past apartheid
regimes. Tt has instituted
one of the most corrupt
systems of self cnnchment
by political leaders and
their close friends and
relatives, [thad created an
elite system whereby a
small clique denves all the
benefits atthe detment of
the deprived. poverty
stncken population, [thas
insttuted tnbalism of the
most naked kind in the
civil service and
parastatals.

The Swapo-govern-
ment has squandered our
resources by the mishan-
dling of the national
budget as was again re-
cently pointed out by the
Auditor General. It is ap-
parent that the Swapo
government ts just not in-
terested in maintaining

any fiscal or monetary
discipline.

Vive de the renult of
competent and unquah
fied people being ap-
pointed to responsible
positions merely on the
basis of their ethnic and
tibal ongin. The govern
ment ts using legal means
to achieve illegal ends It
is thus clear that the ac-
tions of the present
Swapo leadership have
deviated drastically from
the capectauions of the
masses of our people

That brings us to the
crucial questions at us
juncture in our histors
WHAT IS TO BE
DONE?

That is the question that
was asked by Lenin when
Mother Russia laid: shut
tered because ot
maladministravon, cor
tuption, cthnte contlicts
and Tsar dictatorship This
question also has to be ane
swered by Nammbians al
this point in history
