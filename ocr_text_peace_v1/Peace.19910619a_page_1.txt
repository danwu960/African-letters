Job well done

TT IS almost fifteen moaths
in-

Namibia. Dr Sam Nujoms, we
thank you for your leadership
and for keeping our people

| together in harmony.

There is no doubt that our
democratic system is working
- politically, we are free. We
recognised that the road tv
economic independence fas
numerous stumbling blocks -
it often requires goods and
services that are not locally

' available and that are bard to

obtain eleewherr.
The government ol this nc»
Republic has done a commend

Trans-Kalahan highs ay a: the
taming of roads in Katutura
and otber townships, are in
decd progress in the nght di-

rection The initiation of aur

links between our neighbours
as well as distant countnes are
highly appreciated.

Your Govemment, sir, has
ombarked upon commendable

housing projects m vanous pasts

i of the country. We know that

in the past the majanty of people,
particularly blacks, were not
kept in mind as far as housing
was concerned.

The ‘development brigades’
imtiated by your government
in order to alleviate unemploy-
men, as well as providing food

| for our people are all well

thought of steps. Incentives
offered toconimercial farmers
have enabled them to produce
bumper harvests of maize (his
scasoo.

Wecommend your Govein-
ment, sir, for recognising the
need to educate our young-
sters. The budget allocation to
the Ministry of Education and
Culture is proof of this. We
know that the allocated funds
to this Ministry will not solve
all the educational problemsio
this country, for they are in-
hented from the apastheid
system, and are complicated
and require evolutionary ap-
proaches.

Many thanks, Mr President,
that our country is for the first
time in history a member of
various international onganisa-
tions. Sir, you have delegated
men and women of high cal-

yeti bre i
mead the work done by the

Prime Minisee and the Speaker
of the National Assembly for
providing the type of feader-
ship that all admire. Both are
pragmatic in their approaches.

Mr President, you pointed
out recently that opposition
parties should not oppose
merely for the sake of oppos-
ing, nor the governing party
defend for the sake of defeod-
ing only. We hope that our
lawmakers wil) reflect national
problems in their parliamen-
tary deliberations instead of
party pohtics.

Now that peace has come to
Angola, we hope that oconomuc
co-operation wath our north-
erm neighbour wil increase

Finally, | would Like to thank
the people of tis nation for

| their unshakeable support to

the goveming party. Let me
remind all those who support

| this party that independence

was hard-won, and itis we the
people, who mual preserve tf.

Let us not be musled by thoee
