I REFER to the letter. which ap-
peared in The Namibian of February
6 1987, written by Mr Clive Algar,
Rossing Uranium's public affairs
manager, accuging Swapo's UN
representative, Mr Helmut Angula,
of making ‘extravagant statements’
about Rossing.

As I looked at Mr Clive Algar’s let-
ter, I quickly realised that this was
@ public relations officer painting a
good picture of his company.

First and foremost I would like to
hear from Mr Algar who has
authorised Rossing to mine uranium
in Namibia. According to my sources,
this company was given a green light
by South Africa in 1970, four years
after the UN General Assembly
revoked South Africa’s mandate to
rule Namibia. Was Rossing ignorant
of UN Decree Number 1 which clear-
ly states: “No person or entity,
whether a body corporate or uncor-
porate, may search for, take, extract,
mine, refine, use, sell, export or
distribute any natural resources
whether animal or mineral! situation
.. within the territorial limite of
Namibia without the consent of the
UN Council for Namibia”.

Were you aware that Ne Namibia is a
“Pry Mk of the UN?
