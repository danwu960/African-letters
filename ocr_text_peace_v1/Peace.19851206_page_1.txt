US scrambles
for Africa

IBELIEVEIN Jimmy Cliff's song,
which says ‘Meeting in Africa’.

lam referring to today’s news me-
dia in which President Ronald Rea-
gan and his Secretary of State, Mr
George Schultz, revealed they back
and support the rebels, as South
Africahas confirmed that tt supports
Renamo with food and ammunition,
in order to stage a coup on the Freti-
mo and MPLA Governments.

[n the face of the world, Ronald
and George have declared war on the
Government of Angola by support-
ing Unita, a rebel movement. Is this
not another Afghanistan-type crisis?

Hardly a week before the meeting
between Gorbachev and Reagan in
Geneva, Reagan openly challenged
Gorbachev with his support for
Unita.

The military position of the
Americans and its Star Wars defence
programme clearly ignores the im-
portance of the Third World.

Were the talks between the USSR
and the USA leading to Armaged-
don, which inthis case is Angola? [f
the Angolan Government calls upon
Russia for support, who can blame
them, but the cowboy administration
in Washington?

Ronald and George's administra-
tion is going to support Unita
through the South African Defence
Force, which is already doing that.

I would liketo inform both Reagan
and Schultz that they have acted con-

trary tothe interests of world peace,
and that they are also violating hu-
man rights,

America, are you scrambling for
positions in Africa? Are you soem-
barrassed by the prospect of world
sanctionsagainst your protege South
Africa? ae
