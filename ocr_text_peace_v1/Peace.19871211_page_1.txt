A military camp

NAMIBIA hasturnedintoa military
camp because the SA regime are
building up the military in our coun:
try. Namibians are conscripted into
the socalled SWATF to fight against
their brothers and sisters. The SADF
uses our country asa springboard for
attacks on our neighbouring states. IN
northern Namibia the SADF and
Koevoet units are committing
atrocities against innocent civilians in
Various Ways.

The Botha regime are not ready to
sign a ceasefire with Swapo to bring
about peace, democracy and economic
stability in southern Africa. The
Botha government also wants to top-
ple the MPLA in Angola and install
the Unita puppets, as they have done
in Namibia.

Inhuman and draconian laws have
been forced on the people of this coun-
try; particularly the oppressed black
mapority: I refer to the curfew regula.
tions in northern Namibia; the check-
point at Oshivello where blacks are il].
treated by the notorious Koevoet:
refusal of passports to progressive
leaders; Proclamations AG 26, 9 and
Section 6 of the Terrorism Act interms
of which police have Virtually
unlimited powers.
