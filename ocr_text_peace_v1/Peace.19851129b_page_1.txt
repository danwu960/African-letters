Unrest has

SINCE THE installation of the ille-
gal and non-supported interim
government, unrest has becn increas-
ing in Namibia.

On the first day of its establish-
ment, the people of Namibia were
shown how they were going to be
treated. Peace-loving Namibians
were beaten and teargassed that day.
Since then people have been detained
without trialand thosein rural areas
have been having sleepless nights be-
cause of intimidation.

[have personally seen how people
are intimidated, and then command-
ed not to report the matter. The per-
petrators of the intimidation claim
they can do what they want because
the people are ‘Swapo supporters’.
Some of the armed men pretend to be
Swapo insurgents when they rob and

increase
1 d
frighten the people.

All these things have been taking
place since the interim government
came into being.

If the intertm government was es-
tablished to bring peace and order
and move the country towards in-
dependence, why don’t they imple-
ment Resolution 435. We know
however, that the aim is to delay the
independence of Namibia.

We sul want the implementation
of Resolution 435. Away with ideas
of delaying our independence. Do
not link our independence to the
presence of Cubans in Angola. An-
gola is an independent country and
we don’t see Cubans inyNamibia.
