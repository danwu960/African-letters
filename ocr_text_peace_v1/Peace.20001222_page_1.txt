Florida county laws Were applicable
to the recount ‘reument during the

document that could resolve the elec-

duplication, disparities and contra
dictions between what the voters did
and what the Electoral College does.
During the election proceedings in
the Florida Supreme Court. | recall
one judge was reported as saying the
US election 2000 fiasco was caused
by people who did not follow young
instructions. This can be an ambigu-
Ous or explicit statement, was it due
to the illiteracy of the voters or the
complication of ballot papers as al-
leged by the Democrats? Prom my

observation people are attributing it
to illiteracy.

According to that judge's state-
ment, it 1s Overt thal the voter's illit-
eracy impelled/incited the whole
election process/ballot counting to
be referred to the court for a verdict.
‘Toe same sentiments/ views were
also teverberated/repeated by our
Prime Minister when he addressed a
Swapo by-election rally at Rundu
this week and he said: “We know
how to count, we are not hke the
U.S”. Obviously this botls down to
illiteracy again.

Conversely, was justice done or
was the citizen's will, voting rights
and voice respected when a clan of
judges took a decision on behalf of
millions of people while their will/

With regard to the change of US
presidents, Africa should not expect
the same favours of the Clinton Ad-

Orities and right from the beginning
operate on business principles/terms
with the Bush Administration.

Finally, voter education should be
made a priority by Political Parties/
Electoral Commissions to ensure a
fair and just victory by political par-
ties in the elections.
