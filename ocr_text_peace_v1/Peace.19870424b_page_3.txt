A dilemma

AN OPEN LETTER to the
Executive Committee of NPP-435
concerning the booklet entitled
The Choice: Namibia Peace Plan
435 or Society under Siege

THE conscientious reviewer of this
weighty essay is confronted with
several dilemmas. Is the pamphlet in-
tended, as its authors suggest in the
to“... present Namibians with
the facts ... and thus to provide them
with with the opportunity of assessing
for themselves the situation and to
draw their own conclusions..." or isit.
as the authors claim, only three
paragraphs lower on the same page “.
to strengthen the commitment of (cer.
tain) churches, parties and groups to
the immediate implementation of
Security Council Resolution 435"

Is it intended toconstitute anal ysis
Or advocacy? The compilers seem
undecided.

Are the authors, ifthey intend to pro-
vide a dispassionate analysis, naive or
disingenuous? If they intend to ad-
vocate a cause, are they merely in-
competent or do they underestimate
the intelligence of their readers?

ps the most distressing factor

of the work is that, despite its gran.
diose claims, exotic style and partisan
tone - even the Namibian Chamber of
is roundly chastised for

having the temerity to seek to have
Namibia excluded from sanctions
against South Africa -it breaks no new
ground. The arguments are al)
familiar, even tired. They, and
numerous others like them - often
more elegantly and persuasively ex.
pressed - have failed to resolve this
dispute, to stop the killing, to bring
Namibians toone another, in the
pest eight years. And how could it be
es the authors accuse those whom they

urpoees.
