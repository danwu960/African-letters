Why Assassinations Don’t Work

ALLOW me some space, please.
to remind some of your readers
that before they write about any
conflict around the globe and the
people involved init, todo some
research first on particular mat-
ters and to have a more realistic
approach.

A letter ta The Namibian
- ‘Condemn the Killers” - 1s an
example where the writer show s
his total ignorance about the
situation inthe Middle Eastand
Us people

The writer claims that Pales-
tinians are forergners inthe Hols
Land and should be expelled by
the Israclis in order to achieve
everlasting peace, He also writes
that Palestinians are not men-
uoned in Phe Bible or recorded
bs historians. In the letter he
cniucised European Union gov -
eramems for condemning the
ussassinauon of Hamas leader
Yassin by Psraclis.

This isn’t the place for me
to write about the 10 000-year
long history of these (vo great
nations which contributed so
much to world cultures in terms
of many discoveries, writings

and science. My sole objective
1s LO COrrecl MIspercepuions on
this particular issue

The fact is that the Arabs
and the Jews believe that they
descend from the same father
- Abraham. No-one is sure who
came firsttothe Holy Land His-
tory only tells us that Palestine
was first peopled by wandering
Stone Age hunters and that per-
manent agricultural settlement
appeared at Jericho about 8000
B.C) According to historical
claims Hebrew (Jews) tribes
arrived from the desert in Pales-
tine between the [4th and }2th
century BoC.and that roughly
the sume time the Philistines
invaded trom the sea,

The name Palestine is in fact
anadaptation troma Greek word
“the land of Philistines” and the
name ismentioned many times in
The Bible. First Book Gen 21:34
“Abraham lived in Philestia for
along me”.

Just for the record | would
like to mention that in 1918 the
Palestine population consisted
of 500 000 Muslim Arabs, 100
000 Arab Christians and 60 000

Jews.

At the time of the 1948 war,
more than 500 000 Palestinians
fled from their country to seck
refuge with Arab neighbours tn
every Arab country where thes
landed, they were treated as
second-class citizens, confined
to ghettos specially created for
them

Why EU governments con-
demn the killing of Hamas
leader Mr Yassinis because thes
believe that the assassination of
political leaders promotes more
violence and does not provide
a solution for either sides. Not
long ago, Swapo was just like
Hamas, on American terrorist
lists,andevervbody wouldugzree
with me that assussmation of its
President, Sam Nujoma, by the
former South African whtte re-
gime, would only have destroy ed
the relauionstip between blacks
and whttes and caused more ha-
tred; but would ulmately never
have prevented Namibia from
becoming independent
