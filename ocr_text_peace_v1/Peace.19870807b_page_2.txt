boss South Africa doing good in
Namibia?

Winterton, when you say that you
feel pity about Swapo because It does
not enjoy majority support from us
Namibians, you are lying completely.
We Namibians have a high regard for
Swapo as the organization which ts
challenging South Africa, and which
wants Resolution 435 to be im.
plemented, and the withdrawal of —
South Africa from Namibia.

We want true independence, and not —
the many little groups which are being
founded by Dirk Mudge and South
Africa, and which are there only tofur-
ther colonize the Namibians.

Mr Andreas Shipanga, look how the
northern part of Namibia is being
made to suffer by South Africa for
whom you are working. How do you feel
when youand Dirk Mudge, travelling
ina Mercedes Benz going to Owambo,
at the Oshivelo gate you are required
to show your ‘kop-kaart’ because you
might be a terrorist? Is that the in-
dependence you wunt or is there any
apartheid that you and Mr Moses Kat-
jJioungua have removed?
