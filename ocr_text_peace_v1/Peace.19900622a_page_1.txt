To the Generals

DURING the years of illegal occupa-
tion by South Africa, J, as a resident
of Suiderhof, had problemis with the
armed forces living next door to me.
The officer commanding the base
lived across the road from my home,
and every time a black person en-
tered my premises, he would give me
a ‘show of force’ and spit in the street
to show his resentment.

Every Friday morning one would
bear sergeant majors shouting at ‘sleg
troepe’ refusing to polish their boots
or behaving ina disorderly fashionin
public. Later a certain so-called
coloured battalion moved in and the
abuse continued. Being a keen gar-
dener in those days at six in the
moming I received a whole run-down
Oo army events for free.

Later still, we have 10-tonne trucks
hurtling down our road (Palm Street)
after someone blew up the SAWI
supermarket situated inside the base.

The main gate of the base was closed

and the side ontrance which leads
NN ee

into suburbia became the main high-
way for the amy.

Then they began to use a siren for
wakiny up the troops

My constan: calls to virally
everyone mn the army led to me be
conmuoy ery unpopular wath the
Windhock-based nulitary. But the
sien system was eveotually aban
doned

On independence | stood in my
garden and spatin the street as the
commander moved out to South
Afnca!

But my dlusions af peace were
shattered when the LIN moved in,
and among others, the Kenyans in-
sisted on being physically fit and
faking the battalion for a run down
Palm Street every momung. Every
white-owned dog in the area went
bananas, as the troops ran past in
heavy boots.

But my story has not ended...

Two weeks ago, after a heavy Fn-
day mght, I fell into bed, and at
O5h00 my nightmare began. Out of
the base came the deep wail of a
bombing siren. I leapt from my bed
and jumped for my pants, images of
Kassinga and Ngiva pounding in my
head. 1 stumbled onto the lawn ex-
pecting chaos, but it was only the
troops being woken up.

Nothing has changed. The base is
still there, slap~bang in the middle of

suburbia. In the early momings, the
air-raid siren goes off.

Could T make a suggestion: that
whoever woes on duty at the base
knocks on bungalow doors to wake
up Loops, of gets the troops to wake
themselves up! Please, this is not
war-tom Angola but good old Suid-
erhof suburbia. As a homeowner near
the base, T ask those in charge to
show consideration for residents.

In the past we canvassed against
military bases in residential areas,
and while the forme: mulers were not
sympathetic, we would have thought
that our new Government would be
more considerate.

Unmarked subjects

THIS is an ajleeal to the head of the
Department of National Education:
to date we have not received our

ten in 1988. We request you to an-
nounce them soon, because we are
tired of writing subjects that remain
unmarked.

If there is no one to mark the
Papers, who were the question pa-
pers drawn up by? Think about the
money we have paid.

We want our marks before July 30
