Hanekom has been re.
Ported as advising the
Hospitality Assoctation
of Namibia (HAN) at the
OTZanisation’s recent
Congress, that jt should
decide Whether it wants
4 “free, Unregulated
market” or a regulated
one. Itis a point that the
Prime Minister made
some time ago. As the
Prime Minister and Min-
ister Hanekom have
both said, HAN cannot
have it both ways.
Minister Hanekom
also requested that our
association and HAN
should try to reach
agreement on the mini-
mum number of rooms
that an establishment
should have to be recog-

mised under new legisla-
tion. We must Point out
that Minister Hanekom
Is essentially advocating
a regulated market, sim-
ply for the sake of what
he hopes will be some
degree of Peace in the
industry. But such a
compromise will not
bring peace, because it
will not address the one
question that we have
always posed: Why
should successful small
businesses be driven out

‘of Business, just because

they are small?

Mr Johnnie Hamman,
the new chairperson of
HAN, is reported as Say-

A

ing that HAN has re-
duced its demand for a
minimum number of
rooms, from ten to five
“to enable new legisla-
tion to be Passed”. In
Saying this, he pretends
that HAN have made a
generous concession.
But it is far from being
8enerous; in fact, it is
cleverly constructed 0)
that, if it were imple-
mented, it would wipe
out the businesses of 95
Per cent of our members,
not to mention the busi-
nesses of many others
who are not members of
Our association. Perhaps
we should share in this

THE NAMIBIAN

Spinit of generous com-
promise, by stating that
although we cannot ac-
cept the wiping out of
the business of 95 per
cent of our members, we
will accept the destruc-
tton of 65 per cent? Or
would 55 per cent be
Sufficient for Mr
Hamman and HAN?
What Mr Hamman
and some members of
HAN are Proposing is,
in fact, much more than
the destruction of, say,
thirty or fifty successful
small businesses. They
are proposing that new
legislation should out-
law the prospect of most

Namibians ever being
able to share in the ac-
commodation imdustry
of their own country in
an cnurcpeneurial way.
They are effectively pro-
posing that no home-
stead in the north of Na-
mibia should be able to
offer accommodation to
tourists. They are effec-
lively proposing that no
resident of, say, Rundu
or Otjimbingwe should
employ the facilities at
her or his disposal to of-
fer accommodation
commercially. They are
effectively proposing
that no Namibian with-
out access to capital re-

» Mr Hanekom

sources of at least half a
milton dollars (at inter-
est rates of above 20 per
cent) should be able to
enter the accommoda-
tion industry. And they
are demanding that the
Namuibtan state should
ratify this discrimination
against its own citizens.

We call upon the me-
dia and the public to rec-
ognise that this issue is
not simply a matter of a
disagreement with HAN
and the Budget and
Home Accommodation
Assocrauion. It is a mat-
ter of principle: and that
principle involves the
question of whether or

not the majority of
Namibians, who were
denied meaningful ac-
cess to economic activ-
ity under apartheid, will
continue to be denied it
under new legislation of
the type proposed by
those who benefited -
and stull benefit - under
the outdated Ordinance
20 of 1973. If members
of HAN are successful
in their demands, then
economic reactionaries
in other sectors will be
encouraged to attempt
the same.
