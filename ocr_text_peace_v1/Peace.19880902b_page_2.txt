1 is how it is done at all schools under
these situations. ‘According to your
report, pupils were disappointed at my
actions. Those were not my actions.
But I was very much disappointed at
the behaviour of my pupils, because
they did not ask the “foreign” pupils
not to use abusive language towards
me.

I did not and do not deserve that
treatment frompupils,andthehonest |
pupils of my school can testify this. =
wanted to address thecrowd but seem.
ingly the only response pupils know ig
“Down, down and once again down”,
clapping handsand dance-running. To
my shock and surprise, “foreign”
pupils took the fire brigade hoapipers
chased me away with water and stones.
Even my pupils who participated in
these actions did not even try to stop
the others from doing it.

The police are on patrol all over
Katutura and more especially around
our school because you made it a soft
target in order to either discredit me
or to put members of my staff under
scrutiny, and they can see for
themselves what is going on at the
school. Why don't you give all schools
as tough a time as you do with us: why
do you concentrate on two or three
schools only? Do you have some
motives or are you bribed to discredit
some schools?

As president of NAMTA (Namibia -
Teachers Association), I want to
reiterate my organization's point viz.
that we do have understanding with

- most demands, but we can't condone
endless boycotts. We admire those who
continue with it but salute the others
who want to continue their studies.

Tocometothese ‘foreign’ pupilson
our soil - it is unfair that they leave

. their schools in peace and come now
and again toharass us. Those who say
] gave away thechildren have toreason
realistically because] readthenames —
of my school pupils, and those who re-

_ mained were not of my school. And how
can these “foreign” pupils expect me
to “protect’’ them when they gave me _
such rough treatment by shouting me. |
“down”, by wetting me, throwing —
stones, and inaulting me for things 1 |
did not deserve or commit.

Let us havea direction, let'us listen

to. one another and let us rei
