It is clear from the Western Pro-
posals, although not explicitly stated,
that in effect the elections will be held
under the joint supervision and contro!
of South Africa and the UN: paragraph
4 states, “In carrying out his respon-
sibilities, the Special Representative
will work together with the offical ap-
pointed by South Africa (the
Administrator-General) to ensure the
orderly transition to independence.

Paragraph 5 states: *... the United
Nations Special RepreBentative will
have to satisfy himself ai each stage as
tothe fairness and appropriateness of
al] measures affecting the political pro-
cess...’ and‘... may himself make pro-
posals in regard to any aspect of the
political process. ’

Furthermore, paragraph 6 states:
‘‘Theimplementation ofthe electoral
process, including the proper registra-
tion of voters and the proper and timely
tabulation and publication of voting
results, will also have to be conducted
to the satisfaction of the Special
Representative.’

In other words, the Special Represen-
tative does not directly conduct the
electoral process but has joint control,
through his proposed recommenda.
tions and supervisory role. This fact is
attested to by the Assistant Secretary.
