Lutheran prayers

I AM moved to prayer and action
every time I read about the Namibian
struggle for independence, peace and
justice. Please know that I and many
other Americans are watching the
developments in Namibia closely.
We pray for your freedom and for a
peaceful Namibis. Many of us are
calling and writing letters to the United
Nations and US Government offi-
cials to ensure the safety of Namibi-
ans.
Thanks to The Namibian for pro- |
viding Namibians and the whole world
with vigorously researched stories
that shed light on the truth.
