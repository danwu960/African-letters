Guilt On His Mind After Death

YES. thisishow we have

atl fourned of the death

Of Moses Garocb. Now
hat he as dead, Moses
Gurocb will be a differ:
ent man. Different from
the Moses Garoeb who
lived during the libera-
tion movement. On the
occasion of his death,
may I convey, through

this newspaper, my con-
dolences to those who
loved and appreciated
him as father and hus-
band.

May the “unusual” re-
avuion to his death make
them an exception. At
this ime of sorrow f do
Not want to add insult to
injury of Mr Garoeb’s
fumily.

Mfoses Garoeb dies as
inan with guileon fis
mind. He has totally

failed to openly admit
thathe was, together with
others, responsible for
murdering many inno-
cent sons and daughters
of the country. Although
he died a troubled death,
he is in his motherland.
He was buried as a
“hero” in disguise.

fam bitter. Moses
Garoeh has left his Po-
hitroal successors to in-
berst blood stained

“files”,

In that sense his death
isunumely. They are left
with unanswered ques-
tions about the Lubango
genocide.

I have always urged
Swapo leaders to clear
this dark part of our re-
cent history, but with no
SUCCESS.

Will we have to wait
until the last butcherdies
and been afforded a he-
ros funeral before we
find answers to this ques-
ton?

Today many families
are cry ing for their loved
ones who were murdered
by the notorious Swapo
security menin Lubango

of which Moses Garoeb
made a part. He has never
been and will never be a
hero as far as I am con-
cemed. I have seen him
victumising us. Lucky
enough, I have survived
to tell the tale. For as
long as the fate of the
Lubango victims is not

cleared | will die with a

troubled hean and Na-
mibra wall never know

genuine peace.

I know just as every-
one does, that anyone,
good or bad, can be
named a hero as long as
his/her comrades are in
power. That is why the
“heroes” of the apartheid
era are now removed
from the face of Na-
mibia. Streetnames have
been changed because
friends of the apartheid
“heroes” are no longer
In power.

For those who glorify
Moses Garoeb as a hero
of the Namibian people,
Justremember that he di-
rectly participated in the
brutal killings and exter-
mination of my brothers
and sisters in Lubango
and Zambia.

We are still mourning
their deaths. Our parents
did not have the privi-
lege tobury their beloved
children and husbands.
