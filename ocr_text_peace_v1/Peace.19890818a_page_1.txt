Chief and returnees

THERE are unbearable restnctions
imposed on Namibian returnees to
their homesteads and areas by cer-
tain tnbal chiefs. One of them is
Stefanus Comelius Weyulu in the
area of Kongo. He must remember
that the people he 1s restnctung are
owners of the land he pretends to
own.

They are poopte who have struggled
for many years for change and peace
in this country, Kongo included.

You say you have no room in the
area for us. Your future resis on your
bad faith towards these peopk.

Also bear in mind the fact that the
notorious Koevoet squad and socal-
led home guards have becn operaung
in your area, so you had better change
your attitude.

We come beck to the land of our
birth, m which we were bom, not to
be colonised and intimidated again.
A misled person like yourself should
not prevent us from coming you, and
you are wasting your time by trying
to do 80.

Do not try and harm the returnees,
they are here for peace and not for
war. If you do not know what is
happening in the country now, then
ask your more politically -conscious
friends or ettend a Swapo rally and
learn that we are not hostile

You mrust now reconcile with the
offended, and do not

_ in the country.

again about your actions. You will
harvest the products of your labour,
your former stance now. Tomorrow
may be too late.

_ Allow Namibians to exercise their
rights in the land of their birth and
stop recruiting Namibians as body-
guards and those who search homes
al night for returnees.

ASA is more agfanised that the NNSL
