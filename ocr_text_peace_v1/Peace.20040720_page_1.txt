Down With Hate Speech

PROMPTED by the publication of
“instances of hate speech” by the National
Societ) of Human Rights tin our media
allow me to pass some comments, and
e\press my personal opinion on this very
SCTIOUS Issue.

} don’t think it would be necessary to
write or explain more about the grave
consequences of hate speech. Its all
well Known and documented in places
like Bosnia tthe country of my births and
Rwanda

Phave to mention that for many vears |
used to live under to, which Pwould call
“evil systems). being communism and
apartheid respectively,

Howeveresil the 40 were. none of the
two allowed hate speech to be directed
towards other nationalities orraces: Under

the communists, hate speech even heavily
puntshable by the law.

Here in Namibia where the building of
“one Namibia one Nation” and reconcill-
ation should be the priorities for the sake
of peace and stability.

We have destructive clements amony
the democratically elected publie figures,
like some government officials and upton
leaders. who ure by their speeches finding
it very difficull to connect ther mouths
with their brains

What makes matters even worse. (heir
speeches are broadcasted, over and over,
momost of our spoken languages

Even winning by 99% OF votes, no
government can cham: for ttself to be
transparent and democratic it it allows
the nghts of minorities to be disrespected

and violated.

However, NBC and other instigators of
racial hatred in our society didn tachieve
anything so far and hopetully this will be
so in the future Tas a white Namibian,
ean stl walk freely tn-any of the “black
residential areas without fear of rachal
MoU ated allacks.

It Namibian fallen heroes, who died tor
a mulliracial society and justice im this
country, could now hear whatcomes outed
the mouths of Rapendaand Rapia. believe
me. thes would turn in there graves.

My sincere congratulation goes to all
peace loving Namibians on their shown
maturity and tolerance.
