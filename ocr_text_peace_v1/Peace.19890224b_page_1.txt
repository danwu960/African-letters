pitted a job in 24 hours, whereas
myself sod an assistant completed
a similar task in 12 hours. Still,
we as semi-skilled employees are
unequally compensated. At
Rossing there are approximately
118 Grade 8" $s with an average of
more or less 10 years of experi-
ence. So - can the grievances of
roughly 118 employees be ‘‘indi-
vidual grievances”’ as claimed
by Rossing?

According to Rossing, they
normally require NI and N2 to
recognise employees as artisans.
| This is a requirement enforced
about four years ago. How is it
possible for a white person from
Holland to be employed i in a Skilled
position without a qualification?
Why is it that the mentioned for-
cigner was transferred from the
workshop to another work area
Only after the stasement on Rossing

discnminatory practices appeared
in The Namibian (10/02/89)? Why
was the position frozen and not
filled with a Namibian? Is Rossing
preaching more than practising
their so-called Namibianisation
programme and only using it as
propaganda?

answered, will prove that at
Rossing not all is praise.

Lost manhood

A WORD or two to all Namibi-
ans, black and white, who want
democracy and peace in this
country.

To a large extent the evil-doers
have succeeded in producing, at
the output end of their machine, a
kind of black man who is man
only in form. This is the extent to
which the process of dehumanisa-
uon has advanced. The type of
black man we have today has lost
his manhood. In the privacy of
his ‘pondok’ his face twists in
silent condemnation of white
society, but bnightens up in sheep-
ish obedience as he comes out
hurrying in response to his mas-
ter's impatient call. Sometimes
he joins the chorus that roundly
condemns the white masters, but
is first to praise the South African

Goverment and puppet govem-
