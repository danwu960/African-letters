Tell the truth :

ALOT of: confusion is dsliberately be-
ing created about Resolution 435.The
only way todemystify the said Resolu-
tion is to publish Resolution 436, the
Contact Group's plan for Namibia and
other subsequent documents for all
and sunary to see w i i

sddreesed.” | hat is being

The honourable Administrator
General is adding to the confusion by
repeating issues that were long since
dealt with. Are his pronouncements
aimed at shipwrecking the present
negotiations, or are they an indication
of South Africa’s unwilling participa-
tion in the talks?

The question of the socalled ‘UN par:
tiality’ was addressed to the satisfac.
tion of the SA Government from 1978
to 1982. South Africa wae satisfied to
such an extent that at one point the SA
Minister of Foreign Affairs went on
record saying the “Cuban issue’ was
the only obstacle to the implementa.
tion of Resolution 435.

It is however, important to state that
itis not only the UN that must be im.
partial, The same impartiality 18 ex:
pected from the office of the Ad.
ministrator General. Both the Special
Representative ofthe UN's Secretary
General and the SA representative -1n
terms of 436 - are meant toobserve im.
partiality during the implementation
of 435.

| It is thus quertionabie:

“! for a South African Government

representative to tell Namibians who
their enemy 18, thus pushing them to
unite. IsittosafeguardSouth African
interests? Would anybody whoclaims
to be a true Namibian really want to
be directed by a South African Govern:
ment official in his aspirations? This
is ample proof that the AG really can-
not lay claim to impartiality.
(] what about South Africa’s support
for the socalled internal. arties, both
moral and material? Wil that stop or
would be have another financially

-up Muzorewa in Namibia, at-

tempting to win the hearts of Nam.-
bians - with money?
[ what about the impartiality that —
needs to be shown by institutions like |
SWABC radio and television; by the
Post Office? What steps is South Africa
taking in respect of this? We cannot
forget the non-availability of
te andtelexes for the Patriotic
Front at the time of electionsin 1980.

The double talk: peace and in-

dependence on the one hand and a

of obstacles in ts road to peace

ndependence- to more con:
anon More important, it makes it dif.
ficult to believe that South Africa ia
