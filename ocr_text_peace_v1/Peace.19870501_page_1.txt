Reply to Kozo

WE HAVE read, with interest, a letter
received from Minister Kozonguizi
typed on a letterhead of the Depart
ment of Information, indicated that
even such letters are done at the tax
payer's expense

Minister Kozonguizi’s epistle is
what hecallsa “review” ofour booklet

“The Choice - Namibia Peace Plan
435 or Socrety under Siege”

The booklet attempts to present
Namibians with the facts and by the
proviston of these facts and the
analysts of these facts, to strengthen
the commitment of ali these who call
for immediate impiementation of
Resolution 435 of 1975

Itconstitutes analysis as weil asad
vocacy Itstands however in stark con
trast tothe typeofadvocacy anddistor
tion of facts by the Honourable
Minister and all those institutions,
parties. groups, persons and
mouthpieces with whom the
Honouruble Minister, his yovernment
andthe South African Government. ts
closely associated

It presents the truth in rebuttal of
the propaganda daily poured out for
Mr Kozonyuizi s cause and financed by
millions. if not billions of Rand from
the pockets of the South African and
Namibia taxpayers, andin the case of
Namibia without the consent of the
taxpayers and without the consent of
Namibians

If ever there was denigration
without facts and without reasen, vou
seertin the Minister's letter which ts
typical of the massof propaganda com
ing from that source

According to the learned advocate
who has never practiced in this coun
try, advocacy a ounethie i or un

quately in our booklet and readers are
referred to it

We can all agree thata constitution
isone ofthe most important pillars of
a stable democratic state -1f not the
very foundationof it, But surely such
an important basic document must
represent the will of the people of
Namuibra otherwise it will have to be
imposed andthenit will not be worth
the paper on which it is written To
represent the will of the people, it
follows that only truly elected
representatives of the people can
represent the will of the people

Andtoelect such representatives of
the people who will thendraw upacon
stitution for Namibia. in the exercise
of their self-determination and right
to independence, 1s the very aim and
essence of Resolution 435 of 1978

After the constitution so drawn up by
the elected representatives, there
could be a further election forthe first
government of Namibia in terms ofthe
agreed constitution That willineffect
meanaconstitution before anclection
for a Namibian government

In the case of Namibia. however.
there already exists an international
ayreement.on the inclusion of certain
specified constitutional principles and
fundamental human rights in the
future constitution of Namibia and
also safeguards for the protection of
minorities in the form ofa provision for
proportional representation and for
the further details of the constitution
to be decided upon by at least a two
thirds majority

So itis clear that even here a com-
promise hus already been reached
between those who want a constitution
first and those who want an election
before a constitution

Swapo hasconsistently stood by the
peace plan and the democratic elec:
tions provided for in it, whereas
Minister Kozonguiz:. Minister
Shipanga and others show no sign of
suggesting anv sort of country-wide
elections to legitimise their appoint
ments by the SA Government Have
vou redefined democracy, Minister
Kozonguizi? If 30, please let the ‘in
telligent” readers have vour definition
and your government's planof action
for democracy. self-determination and
internationally recognised
independence.

If vour vague allegations ayainst
Swapo ure trut, you should welcome
elections in termsof Resolution 435 of
1978 because then vou can attack and
denigrate Swapo in their presence in
front of the Namibian people The
peace plan provides for the return of al!
refugees and one can imayine the
many witnesses then becoming
available to substantiate these
charges. iftrue, Why miss such an ex
cellent opportunity to free the tortured
refayees and confront Swape face to
face? The Namibian peuple can then be
the judges When the Honourable
Mirusterdeniyrates Swapo, he should
rememberthat he himaelf{sct out the
options for Namibian resistance after
the 1966 World Court decision on
Namibia, when in anarticlein African
Forum, he declared: “In fact. the deci

whether political or muilttary, are only
four. Inthe political realm the choices
seem to be three (1) capitulation » by
which 1 mean that South West Africa
may bow to fate by accepting the South
African settlers and abiding bv the dic
tates of the Pretorta government, (2)

negotiation - tn the hope that the SA
Government may modify its position
which would amount to capitulation:
(Srindifference inthe hope thatother
countries, other powers, may take up
their struggle and attain freedom for
them. None of these, especially the first,
seems very likely

The fourth 1s armed struggle
whichis alwayseasier todiscuss than
toplan, easertoorganise than to carry
out, for it must be pursued with
ruthless determination to win and
it must be reinforced by a principl-
ed dedication to the cause. From
thier public pronouncements, iLseems
clear that the leaders of South West
Africa are moving in the direction of
armed struggle”

ft appears that the Honourable
Minister has since 1966 accepted the
firstoption above viz “Capitulation. ”

What basis do Namibians have for
beheving that the interim government
willabide by whatever constitution it
might draw up, when itis responsible
tonoclectorate having never faced an
election?

Excuse of UN Partiality: We
acknowledge tn our booklet the fact of
UN partiality, but we explain whys it
will not have any effect on the judge
ment of Namibians ina 445 election
But why don't you acknowledge South
Africa’s partiality? Why not?

The Honourable Minister of Justice
has often inthe past reiterated thatin
Africa power comes from the barrel ot
agun, and we suspect that he and some
of his associates have accepted this
credo.

It seems futile to argue with the
Minister about free and fair elections
Ifinterested in elections at all.it will
have to be elections which he can be
guaranteed to win- and free and fair
elections are unlikely to lead to that
result
