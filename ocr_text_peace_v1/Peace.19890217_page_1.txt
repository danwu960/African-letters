Reply to Shipanga

THIS letter follows one by Mr
Vezera Kandetu (The Namibian
Jamuary 14 1989) and to the reply by
Mr Andreas Shipanga. I was going to
stat my mouth al this ume, and merely
hope that the future would bring me
and fellow Namibians the best.

When Shipanga joined the TGNU
he knew very well that they would be
tesponsible to the Government of
South Africa, and he chose to fight
for freedom, liberty and self-deter-
mination with the South African
Government, with Botha ‘leading the
revolution’ and the Administrator
General es the man in charge of the
socalled ‘defenders’ of the nghts of
Nanubians.

What does Shipanga mean when
he says ‘It is just this sort of hubns
which has hampered the struggle for
truc liberation in Namibia forsolong
and encouraged the armchair revolu-
lionaries to waste their words and
deeds on irtelevancies’.

To tell the truth, Shipanga is one of
those who hampered the struggle for
true Liberation if he remembers what
he did in 1978: he divided the froe-
doen fighters. And the description in
question fis him very well. Lei me
say, he has been an annchair revolu-

tionary who hes been wasting his
words and deeds, by way of
tb Namiblen people along nie
Eeeets, Th potio of he and his

colleagues made the South African
Government realise that they could
not enforce its rule through Namib-
ian intermediaries, and so they went
to the negotiating table.

The TGNU never had the power to
decide, and the South Afncan Gov-
emment got what it wanted from the
interim government.

Swapo would like united people as
itis their mMouo to unite the Namibian
people. But how can it succeed in
uniting the people if there are those
hike yourself who are always divid-
ing the nation. Swapo will unite and
join hands with fellow Namibians in
order to build up the nation you dis-
appointed, and the beloved land you
betrayed.

On the question of your call on
Swapo to release the detainces it is
holding, that is none of your busi-
ness. After all, some of these things
are already provided for in accor-
dance with UNSCR 435 (1978) and
629 (1989), and all dates and events
are based upon the Annex to the
settlement Proposal S/12636 of Apni
10 1978, just in case the South Afri-
can Government hasn't bnefed you.

Why didn’t the intenm govern-
ment repeal laws such as AG 26:
many Namibians have been detained
without trial, and the interim govern-
ment did not question this.

There are no atrocities in Swapo
camps; and it was you who started
Organising brother to stand against
brother, and sister against sister.

Just look ef the man who likes
pease and who socs himself as the
nation’s Liberator, praising the Koevoct

unit (The Namibien, May 1 190¥)"/
One may forgive, but not feupes

On AWB leader

ALLOW me to air my views in the
people's newspaper andelire my
feelings with true Nasfibians about
this man (HendgeX van As, leader of
the AWB),

This As looks like an adult
m but I wonder ... H hibits
discrimmanon end racism gr seems
to hate the Ovambos. bi€ talks about
crimes but he capw6t prove that the
Ovambos bryaif the record with re-
gard to rpp®, theft and killings.

WB always complain about
cripfes but they have people who
clgim to be members of the terrorist
g OUD a a) and what
about their influence in the’army in
northern Namibia.

Van As calls

Ovambo's ‘un-
civilised’: bu atever their state it
is duc to policies of racism and
ap 16 imposed by the South A fri-

can Qovarnment, who have also denied

emtheir findamental human rights.

] want to let peogle like van As
know thal the South/Africans gave us
bantustan-type pducation; once we
are responsibi€ for educatng our-
selves, we run this country with-

out Van As and his kind. We don't
want sodalled ‘white wolves’ here
anyway.

Neither can Van claim that
Hereros and Bastepe’don't want a
Swapo gov fi. He is merely
talking on behsff of the stooges of the
South Afripdn Government, and aot
the peoplé.

ther Van As likes it or not, im
this dountry we want to get rid of
d South Affican ocon-
pation and we wish to gain
ence. Down with he AWB Wh
Wolves’. Up with oof Nesibie.
