: â€œIn spite of all predictions, the
guerrilla fighters do not practice in-
timidation at the pomt of the gun
and maintain a rather strict disci-

tended to Swapo for its restrained
reaction to the assassination of An-

escalate to an unmanag({able level.
Election result: Most parties have
resorted to an anti-Swapo election

often based on lies. The shocking
incidents of April 1, and the un-
solved question of Swapo dissident
camps have put oil on the flames of
general accusations. As much as we
would like to put a finger on certain
issues and condemn certain acuons,
we should not become blind to the
fact that for the majority of Namibi-
