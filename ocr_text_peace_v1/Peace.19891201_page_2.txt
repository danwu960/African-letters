tile forces, whereby they can march
in and out of our country at will. In
order for Namibians lo live in peace,
there musi be a sense of security.
Moreover, those gains that we have
made must be protected. We have to
protect our peace, democracy and
natural resources. Without a defence
force, our country 15 casy prey. The
concept of demilitarisation can only

be realistic if it encompasses all
neighbouring countries, especially
South Africa. There also must be
democracy and peace in South Af-
rica and Angola for this Utopia to be
realised.

Lastly, a defence force does nol
necessarily have to be destructive. It
can be constructive especially if itis
defensive in nature rather than offen-
sive. While a deterrent force, its
personnel and infrastructure can be
employed in development projects.

Therefore a defence force should
not be perceived as an anti-develop-
ment force or a threat to Namibians
but rather as a source of pride and
security to our country and all ats
citizens.
