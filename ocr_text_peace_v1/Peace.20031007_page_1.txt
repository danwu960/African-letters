‘Batfy’ Gets A Bashing

ALL I can say is thank God The
Namubian didn’t accept Batfour
Ankomah’s challenge to reprint
his entire lecture in full. Pm allin
favour of fantasy fiction but after
reading Baffour’s lengthy,
obscenely self satistied and
patronisingly racist letter in The
Namibian (not to mention
watching him in person blathering
away on Talk of the Nation), Pd
have to say that Namibia has
suffered enough,

Begone, Batfour! Go back to
your cruel exile in) your
comfortable London flat with its
potholed road (not to mention
fancy restaurants, political
security and snappy boutiques)!

Or better sal, if you think that
potholes are a serious indictment

of Western values, cut the poor
British some slack, hop ona plane
and leave them 1n peace as well.

Take your mercenary little rag
of a magazine with you. Open a
newspaper office in Zimbabwe,
perhaps.

I hear there’s one currently
vacant in Harare and you've got
the Zanu-PF government line
down pat. Lassume thatMugabe’s
people pay you. Or at the very
least fly you around showering
you with free hotel rooms and
bodyguards. Baffy, my little
exiled buddy, tell me I’m wrong!
Can't. Can you?

One final suggestion.

How about returning to your
native Ghana? You can’t still be
inexile surely? Not after all these

years? Not when you love Africa
so much and know so much about
this great continent. Not after all
the political change that has taken
place in Ghana? And you, Batfy,
stl in exile?

Or perhaps you are. Given your
morbidly turgid prose, your
depressing dictatorial arrogance,
your inability to write a simple
letter without giving a moderate
newspaper reader (me) dyspepsia,
and the sheer lunacy of your stance
onissues suchas HIV-AIDS, how
wonderful it ts to live under
Mugabe, and the evils of press
freedom, perhaps you are.

Yes, perhaps you are.
