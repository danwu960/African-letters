On Matijila

This is an open letter to the so-
called Minister of Education, Mr
Andrew Matjila and I refer to his
shameful speech on the Radio —
Qwambo in the Okambiya
Kamahola programme.

He was speaking about boycotts in
the north as well asin Katutura, Win-
dhoek. What upsets me is when Mr
Matjila said that the students have
nothiny todo with the implementation
of the future plan, Resolution 435.

This arose from the time students
wrote placards demanding the im-
mediate implementation of the peace
plan.

How can he say we students are too
young todemand the implementation
of the plan?

I personally say to him that we
students are not children and foolish.
He has allowed himself to be used by
South Africa.

I warn Mr Matjila to tell his
Makakunyas to end the tear gas and
rubber bullets as the way of suppress-
ing the strikes. We studenta are the
leaders of tomorrow and we are not
mistaken to demand the implemen-
tation of the 1978 peace plan.

We are tired of colonialism.
