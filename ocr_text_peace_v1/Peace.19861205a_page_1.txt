Objective view

ASA socalled white South African, liv-
ing in Johannesburg, and not a
member of any one of the great number
of political parties in Namibia, I feel!
have the right to try and objectively
aseees the incident of November 30
where the supporters of Swapo were
routed by what is generally known
here as Koevoet.

I was invited to the peace rally (sic)
by friends. I went there because, being
a South African, I thought ‘How
wooderful. I always thought Swapo
was a banned organisation’ (At least
that is the way | was indoctrinated by
the press in South Africa). So! went

It was quite an experience. People
singing and dancing, a group of
children splendidly dressed in Swapo
colours, dancing to the tune of a whia-
tle, blown by a smal! boy. And the
Swapo police! Dreesed resplendently,
some with wooden AK-47 rifles,
painted blue, green and red. Tradi-
tional kieries and spears (covered with
cooldrink cans to make gure the sharp
points cause no incidental harm).

The peace rally was opened with o
prayer. An old black man, praying in
Afrikaans, for the rally to be peaceful
and in the name of God. There were
some speeches and then a group of
socalled vigilantes started injuring
people and damaging cars in the road.
They were chased away by the Swapo
police and we all started singing again,
determined to allow peace to get the
upper hand.

The next moment Casspirs arrived
Much too s00n to have been summon-
ed from the police station. They were
close and ready. The hatches flew open
and the firing started. Horribly sud-
den. A terrible and unecessary act of

ked violence.

The air was thick with teargas and
rubber bullets. We all ran, blinded and

Then they came again. I crawled
wormlike under the car. [knew I would
be at the very least injured ifthey saw
me, a white person, there.

By now they were firing teargas at
random into houses. Houses of people
who weren't even at the rally. Houses
with emall babies, screaming and
choking.

Eventually I reached safety through
rides with other reporters. That was
yesterday (Sunday). Today (Monday)!
read the news: “People started fighting
among themselves .. the police
endeavoured to bring peace ..”” and
worst of all, this line in an editorial col-
umn: “This time Swapo will have todo
much more than the traditional ac-
cusation that the police are responsi-
ble for the violence’ (Translated from
Afrikaans).

What can I say, except, that ifthese
are the workings of democracy, Nami-
bians should wake upto reality. Do not
allow your future, and the future of
your children, to be placed in the hands
of demented perpetrators of violence,
acting under the cover of reality. I beg
you, wake up.
