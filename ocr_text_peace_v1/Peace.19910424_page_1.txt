'Mbotsotsos'

[WOULD hke to air my views
regarding the statement by
Police Commissioner Siggi
Eimbeck in which he criticised
residents of Katutura of hav-
ing killed two members of
“mbotsotso”.

I make state categorically
that it is regrettable that the
Commissioner made such a
statement, regarding people
taking the law into their own
hands.

Even though Namibia is an
aay arene state, people are
not fee to move here and there.
They remainin a stato of panic

and feer when moving around,

y at night.
exe being robbed, killed
end harassed by gangsters.

Yet the police accuse people
who live among bad elements,
for killing them in defending
an elderly man. You should
not blame people whose aims
are to do away with cnminals
in this cuyatry. Rather take
steps again the cnminals

The houses where these bad
elements are staying are well
known to everybody, the po-
lice included. The “mbotsotso”
should not be allowed to lake
the law into their own hands
and disturb peace and stability
in Uus country. Moreover, we
are aware of those who col-
laborate with the “mbotsotso”’.

The reason why Katutura
residents decided not to fold
their arms and watch their
beloved fellow citizens being
killed by “mbotsotsos” is
because if they are brought
before justice they will proba-
bly be granted bail or acquitted
by a count of law.
