Namibians have never invited the
presence of South Africa, nor protec.
tion of anv kind for that matter. None
of our real elected leaders did (lipum-
bu, Maharero, Witboo:, Kutako ete).

Andsoitcontinues that thecry of the
Namibian masses still vanishes into
the annalsotboguscommunist mars
ist threats and makeshift supremacy
of the minority.

For how longis:nnocent Namibian
blood going toovertlow the aridanddry
riverbeds of this piace? For how long
now have the presidents and prime
ministers of Trans-Oranje preached
that the inhabitants of this country
will decide their own destiny?

But still the colonial master 1s rul
ing withan iron fist; their companies
still rummaying the distant hills for
our natural resources; their police still
brutally assaulting our innocent peo-
ple, not because of what they say. but
because of their black skins.

Still our children are deprived of
basic education - they are not - unlike
the whites, forced legally to attend
school up to acertain age; the creation
of a semi-skilled black society to
hamper the revolution of the skilled
majority; the stealing of our fish under
the pretext of development; the legalis-
ed system of plundering and assault of
unarmed civilians; the hes of many of
those engaged in the system, the im-
position of an unelected puppet govern-
ment. These and others, are the order
of the day. ; ,

But still the ‘Capi du tuti Capi’ of
racism speaks, in contradiction to
what he does, of reconciliation and
peace. Pretoria ignores, with pro.
vocative contempt, thecry ofthe Nam):
bian people: implement Resolution
