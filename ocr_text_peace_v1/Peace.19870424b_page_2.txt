past eight years. And how could it be
otherwise, when thoes arguments -just
asthe authors accuse those whom they
attack of doing - gloss over or sidestep
uncomfortable facts and bend reality
to suit their limited purposes.

Toturn instead to a few substantive

points raised in the text:
Why a Constitution before elec-
tions? So that you know what you are
going to get. A constitution is the
skeleton of a country’s political
system; the set of parameters within
which the political contest between
parties espousing different ap-
proaches, is regulated. Constitutions
reflect common values, not the
political preferences of a (temporary)
mapority.

Building on the constitutional prin.
ciples and guidelines of the Western
Five - adopted at the instance of the
much-maligned Reagan Administra.
tion - set out in Annexure J to the
NPP-435 study, all that 1s necessary
now, is to agree on a constitution em-
bodying these principles, before
elections.

Can the members of NPP-435 really
be so gullible as to wish to rely on the
possibility that Swapo - a most
undemocratic organisation, as all
Namibians with any experience of it
know - wil] abide by abstract principles
limiting its power, if it is under no
obligation to do so.

Constitutions, in setting limits on
the freedom of majorities to work their
unfettered will on others in society, are
the best guarantee of civilised govern-
ment yet developed. They are best con.
structed so as to be acceptable - as the
rulesof the political game - toal]in any
national society, not just to a tem-
porary majority. Perhaps this is the
point the authors have missed.
Exeuse of UN Partiality The pro-
tagonists of the present arrangements
in the UN are often least comfortable
when addressing this point.

The facts are that SWAPO has been
declared repeatedly since 1973, by the
Genera! Assembly, tobe the ‘sole and
authentic representative of the people
of Namibia’. As a consequence of this

and other actions of the Assembly, it
enjoys the status of ‘permanent
observer’ throughout the UN system.

Those who have had the opportuni.
ty todiscussing these matters with UN
Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, can testify to his personal
discomfort and embarrassment at the
