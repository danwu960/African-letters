A Resolution was adoptedinthe UN
callingontheSADFâ€™s withdrawal from
Angola. The SA representative
responded that they would not
withdraw unless foreign troops were
withdrawn from Angola. This is unac-
ceptable and stubborn because the
MPLA Government has never
declared war against South Africa;
Fapla troops have never attacked or oc-
cupied SA territory; Angola is a
sovereign country which hastheright
to choose its own friends. |

Namibiansshould unite; both black
and white, and raise their voices in pro-
test against theSA regime. Enough is
enough. We want to taste the fruits of
peace, nationhood, national unity,
human dignity and justice.
