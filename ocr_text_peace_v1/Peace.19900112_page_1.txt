used to light up schools. If Namibia

Therefore, after independence.
Namibia should change its clocks to

Not a negative force

THE assessment as to who our
enemics currently are by the Director
of the Association for the Hand:-

“ERO SOTIJIVANJA.

“RE GL MARI KOTOKA.

*FOTSIUANA.,

capped is currently more or iess correct.
This siteation should give us the few
years of peace we noed in order to
build a truly professional military
establishment.

However the future is unknown to
humans and we are unable to deter-
mine now what the situation wall be
in fifteen years. Military cxpens
throughout the world agree on their
assessment conceming Africa south
of the Sahara It is a dangerous un-
stable power keg ready to be touched
off by the smallest spark. Inresponse
lo this situauuon Amenca, France,
Bntain, Russia (and soon Italy) have
Organised specially trained and
equipped forces to conduct military
operations in Africa.

Contrary to the Director's appar
ent belief, amuilitary establishmentis
not a ncgauve force in the develop
ment of a country. It can, if struc
tured in the proper way. achicve all
the objectives outlined by the Direc
tor for the Development Force

Tn addition it can serve as achan
nel for technological wansfer, devel
opment and expansion of our indus:
unal infrastructure, our off shore
fishing industry (three of the world’s
largest ship budding Companies agree
with me on this) and intemal and
extemal transport networks. Itcan be
a positive force in raising the educa
tional level of future generations,

, effect posiuve changes within our

society and itis the only vehicle that
has the potential of being a melting
pot to change our diversified people
intopne people onc nation while also
serving as a shield of protection of
our freedom.

For four years | have been study-
ing how our new military establish-
ment should be organised, structured
and equipped to achieve these goals.
Tt can be done within our financial
means.

The military profession through-
at the world has ands working hart

forces thas are a
tive foros in their society and a force
for peace not war.
As we look back ai history we find

The very high levels of adtvance-
ments made in the last (wanty years
in the rehabilitation of the handi-
capped is adirect result of work done
by the world’s major military estab-
lishments.
