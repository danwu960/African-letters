SA encourages division among us

FIRSTLY, | WOULD like to con-
gratulate the local journalists who
are trying to bring news to the coun-
try as a whole, in the form of news,
and not one-sided propaganda. But
we must allow readers to express their
opinions in the people’s paper.

We have seen in the past that
progressive forces have been fighting
for our rights which have been, and
still are, denied to us.

We want to show the people of

come together and live as one.

Peace in the region will only be
achieved when neighbouring coun-
tries do not attack one another, and
the rights of people are considered,
with reference to self-determination
and national aspirations.

We the Namibians, reject the use
of our country as a base and buffer

against neighbouring, peaceloving
countnies.

We also appeal to those inthe Tin-
tenpalast to note the activities of Un-
ita, who claim ‘Red’ involvement in
the region. We are aware that they are
not a threat to our peace.

appeal to all Namibians to realise
and make themselves aware of who
is fooling whom, and to support the
immediate implementation of UN
Resolution 435.
