Multipartyism Disappoints...

A LOT has been vad
about multi-party de
Mocracy and the need
for a strong opposition,
especially in Namibia It
ts thus worthwhile to

consider a few important

'Ssues in this regard

Worldwide, bul par-

teularly in Africa, his-
tory has shown that, un-
fortunately, most new
Parties are fueled more
by personal ambition
and by hatred of the 1n-
cumbent leadership than
by a proper analysis of
the real structural issues
Such pasties thrive ¢s-
pecially during eco-
nomic hardships Exam-
ples are plentiful, but for
the sake of brevity, only
two will do for now
* The Movement for
Mult)-Party Democracy
(MMD) in Zambia, was
a loose alliance of

strange  bedtellows

whose only claim to

fame was hatred for

Kaunda and UNIP The

MMD capitalised on the

economue hardships to

oust Kaunda and propel
themselves (o power

Now that the MMD are

incumbents, and noting

that they (oo can now be
unseated easily because
the economic maladies
did not disappear despite
their earher promises (o
the contrary. by the same
Kaunda they ousted,
they decide to pre-empt
the electoral battle by
declaring him persona
non grata.

* In the Soviet Union,
Bons Yeltsin was shout-
ing from the rooftops
about the new free mar-
ket system he was going
to introduce. Almost ten

vears later Russia is in

its deepest economic on
sts, they hase moved
from being a super
Power to being the
world’s largest and most
sophisticated beggar
One may ask ‘but
what has this got to do
with Namibia?’ Well,
everything. Namibia got
its independence on the
morrow of the new
monopolar world domi-
nated by the USA. The
Western countries first
regarded themselves as
midwives of Namibia’s
independence, now they
have gone further and
granted themselves the
rights of a parent! They
forgot the Namibian
Goverment has a mind
of its own. Swapo set out
to create a Namibia en-
trrely in its own image
and to re- integrate it into
mother Africa

To top it all, Swape ts
seen to love the things
that Westemers hate, and
vice versa

* Swapo started op-
Posing homosexuality,
like Mugabe. In the West
homosexuality 1s a fash-
1on statement

* They started to be
vocally pro-Afnca.

* They started to
amend the Constitution
to allow for a third prest-
dential term The West
fumed, even though in
Germany Helmut Kohl
was running for his
fourth, wrong. fifth
term. The UK still does
not have a written con-
stitugion while ours ts in
cyberspace.

* Worst of ali, Na-
mibia defied America by
sending troops to the
DRC, again with
Mugabe.

... And So Do Liberation Movements

WHY as it that fiberation movements, whenever they ing ground for lazy. unaccountable, non-transparent,
come into power over Afnca, tum out to be quite a

uademocratic, unresponsible, complacent : and ha
disappointment after a pernod of time?

Dunng the stroggle and after independence, the ex- 4
pectations of the masses run very high. Leaders are ¢
regarded as heroes who would deliver the long-awaited . extied
treedom and socio-economic uplifument.

* Now Namibia is op-
posing Nato’s killing
spree in Yugoslavia

So Namibia must be
punished. But how?
There ts no economic
CTISIS, NO military insta-
bility On the contrary,
there 1s peace and stabil-
ity, in fact too much of
it! How about creating a
‘wirtual crisis’ Yet the
influential newspapers
write about corruption,
self-aggrandisement,
megalomania etc Let
there be headlines about
deaths 1n the Congo, in-
stability in Zimbabwe,
about a resurgent Unita,
fictitious human rights
abuses in Namibia. In
short, target the middle
class and create in them

a hunger for change
There is plenty of
money in the Western
world for any projects or
activities that purport to
protect and promote de-
mocracy, human rights
and environment. So
any of you guys can cre-
ate a party, just make

sure words like democ-

fecy and human rights
feature strongly.

So, will the new par-
ties in Namibia make an

unpact? Well, ume wall
tell We must, however,
remember that culing
parties develop enviable
Strategies to remain in
power and because there
isno real crisis in Na-
mibia apart from the vir-
tual paper crisis it is
much simpler for the rul-
ing part to counteract

any ‘euphoria’ created was

by the new party
The 1999/2000
budget can be regarded
as the opening shots for
the ruling party Even
the staunchest critics of
goverment are ata loss
for words. The problem
of Plan fighters, which
the new party wanted to
tide on, seems to be
tackled once and for all
There is a tax breeze for
everybody, and both la-
bour and corporate cit-
zens are all happy. in-
cluding the fact that they
were consulted!

Swapo will now fire
more shots: His Excel-
lency donatedN$5 000
to kick start a fund for
the aged; he even danced
with senior citizens and
was praised lavishly by
the WHO regional direc-
tor for Africa

* The government do-

nated the cultural house
to the OvaHlerero,

* The Presidential

Commission on Educa-
tron wall table its report
in September and imple-
mentation can only en-
hance the image of the
Bovcrament.

* The gender policy
unanimously

adopted in parhament
and Namibia has in any
case been hailed as a
torchbearer far women’s
emancipation,

* the government can
arrange the troops with:
draw from the DRC after
secunty peace in Kinshasa
and the western comdor,

* the National Youth
Service will be launched
soon:

* the Government can
now intensity the land
reform programme

Virtually all the things
the government needs to
do to stay tn power can
be done well before the
elections.
