How onearthcan they gointoa place
where people are sleeping, wake them
and beating those who want to move,
even to go tothe toilet. Is it because the
people of the socalled compound are
blacks?

Security forces blame Swapo for us-
ing AK-47’s, but what happens to all
the arms they claim to have con-
fiscated from guerrillas? Where are
those AK-47’s you have confiscated?
We are not all children and cannot be
fooled. Perhaps those in the Tinten-
palast and Pretoria can be fooled, but
not us.

The subsequent police press con-
ference was a total distortion of the
truth. There the police claimed that
“we have no knowledge of any assaults
committed by members of the police or
security force members during the
operation. That is rubbish and we have
evidence that people such as Linus
Shipingana and others were assaulted
while looking at police from the cor-
ridors of their room when they were
awakened.

I also wish to condemn in the
strongest of terms the confiscation of
property of compound residents. How
can they confiscate things like knives
or kieries. We are allowed to possess

these things, and nobody needs a per-

“mit to buy or keep the abovemention-
ed items either for household use or self
defence. Let the police chieftell usthat
he has no knife or any other ‘weapon’
in his home.

J appeal toall affected comradesand
the oppressed of Namibia to stand
together andtototakethe authorities
to court over these issues, because
these deeds happen only in Katutura
and never in ‘white’ Windhoek.
