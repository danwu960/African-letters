the old man was permanently disabled,
and later he died.

Many of our people found them-
selves without homes, many had been
buried in unmarked graves, many were
also in detention, and some have been
missing for fifteen years.

It can be that some of you were
wrongfully detained, or wrongfully
suspected of being spies, but it is now
time to forget and to reconcile in the
interests of peace.

Lastly to the parents of those de-
tained, don't defect from Swapo - think
of all those fellow countrymen who
died at Cassinga - an attack that could
have resulted from the information of
spies.

Let us join hands and forget what
happened in the past. We must fight the
_ Teal enemy - South Africa - through the

liberation movement Swapo.
