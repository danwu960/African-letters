Are commiee eo bed?

INTHE last edition of The Nemib-
ion and some other newspaper, I had
the opportunity to read what some
ssembers of the SADF were saying
about comnasenian. Before I say
anything about the subject, I would
like to mform readers that I was born
and brought up in the communis!
state of Yugoslavia. I might add that
while living and working m mry home
town I had always refused offers to
become a member of the Communist
Party.

According to what these army
members say, which can also be taken
as the gencral opmion of Namibian
whites, particularly farmers, com-
munism means dictatorship which
includes the killing pf polincal oppo-
nents, oppréssion, exploitation, pov -
exty and others abuses of human nghis.

Many of them regard anyone who
opposes the apartheid system and
white mmonty rule as a communist
or even, terrorist. I belseve that these
that this socio-political system in
which we live, or have been forced to
live, 1s one of the best. Onc thing is
sure, it is some kind of capitalism.

It is as unwise to say: Chnstianity
is better than Islam or the other way
around, as it is to say or think that
capitalism is better than communism
Or vice versa.

Of course any soci-polincal struc-
ture benefits someone profitably. If
we compare communismos and capt-
talismos, let's say according to the
number of private-owned cars and
television seis, we will have the
impression that capitalism is much
better. But if you look at other things
m the capitalist society, like the number
of suicides, drug seddicts, kidnap-
pings and terrorist attacks, then we
have another picture. It seems to me
that people in the capitalist world are
not so free and happy. Life under
communism is safer and better.

We must also not fail to give atten-
tion to job security in communist
states where it is very difficult to fire
workers from their jobs. Here in
Namibia the firing of workers is

‘normal

If we wanttoleam the facts we will
notice that communism by itself is
not some kind of poverty-maker. In
many communist-ruled states, living

standards are much higher than in
non-communist states; take for ox-
ample Latin America or the Phillipi-

1 nes. None of them are ruled by the

communists but there ero so many
