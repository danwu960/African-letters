Happy birthday

I TAKE pleasure in associat-
ing my Ministry in the joy of
your staff on the occasion of
your newspaper's birthday.
The Namibian has always
been associated with the jus-
tice struggle of the Namibian
people. It has been one of the
papers known for its objective
reporting in our country. The
aims and objectives that your
newspaper stands for has
immensely contnbuted to na-
tional reconciliation and peace
in our country. Indeed, given
this remarkable record, which
patriotic citizen of this coun-
try would not wish your news-
paper perpetual existence!
