DTA and 435

ALLOW me to be an ethnicist at this
moment by introducing myself as a
Caprivian amd a proud ‘Mafwe' for that
taattez. | wish to cxpress concern about
my fellow ‘Mafwes’ who are support-
ocs of the DTA. I am prood, and do not
heaitate to mention thet the Mafwe are
people with « definite culture who
strive for good mora! norms aad codes.
Theeefor what the DTA is doing is not
-in secopdance with oer morms and val-
ton, Chat is, beating other poopie, chal-
lengiog them with dangerous woapons
ae.

_ This is aot only a crime but also
panlabable in ow tribal cours. | am
selecring to tnatences Like those which
took place ot Mekangs, Sinywebuna,

otc. | wonder what it moans when oar
respected Mafwe tribal authority toler-
ates such actons | wonder
whether the Tealises the reper-
cussions for itself.

However, let me sound a warning to
fellow Namibians, particularly the
DTAs. Just as God liberated the Leraelis
from the bondage of slavery to the
Egyptians, God is now going to liberate
His sons, the Namibians, from the yoke
of bondage from SA colonial rule.
Never mind how stubbom Pharaoh
was, the fact remains thai the Israelites
were liberated from Egypt as God de-
cided. Never mind how stubbom the
South Afncans/DTA may be, the fact
remains Namibia will be free.

I have a strong conviction that any-
one who stands in the way of God will
be drowned in the Red Sea This isa
good warning to the DTA.

Mr Martti Abtisasri and his team
represent Moses in the peace process:
“History repeats itself’.

Fellow Namibians and fellow Ca-
privians, fellow Mafwes and the DTA:
““T kanda ka i li twikiwe’': thas is, you
Cannot put the country on your bead. It
is beavy and will break your neck.

We know the DTA was totally
against the implementation of Resolu-
bon 435. We call on this organisation
ot to involve itself in the peace proc-
ess with a manner of pretence, aiming
to disrupt and cause the process to fail.
It must not come owt with dirty ticks
and strategies of using the sadicals of
the community and school dropouts to
prevent the process from being run in
the letter and spirit of 435.

Itis a good sign of ignorance to see a
person showing the ‘two-finger sign’,
shouting ‘demo’ and at the same time
beating, harassing and hindering others
from holding meeangs. It ia time the

DTA holds seeniners enc peaches is

aging them and the pupils present to
take action against teachers belonging
to Swapo. Is this what the DTA will do
when it comes to power?

On the other hand people are ques-
tioning why Swapo does not retaliate. It
has been directly involved in the proc-
css that has brought Namibia to the
present political situation, it knows and
understands what is happening and
where it is heading, and it
wrong elements like DTA and Koevoc
as lost sons. It is ready to receive and
work with both good and bad elements.
A parent socepts all its children. So let
us all come together under Swapo; jet
us avoid fighting ome another, let us
know who the real enemy is.

Finally I want to call on the Mafwe to
sec to it that poople are disciplined and
that they respect and love one another.

Why do we not experience similar
things in the Masubia arcas? Does this
moan they heve a better understanding
and are more cultured than us Mafwo?
T realise there are more political groups
in Masubia than ia ours. We Mafwe
most realise that we will sever have oer

Our ancestors, the Sobiewama, Selal-
ctu, Imataa, Simatas, Lifsel and Si-
tasiloa did not bebave in this smsmer.
