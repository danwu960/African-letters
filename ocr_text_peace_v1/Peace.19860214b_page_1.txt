THE DTA-MPC newspaper seems to

No-one in Namibia can believe MPC supports Resolution 435

be trying once again to destroy any
attempts by the blacks in this coun-
try to get together anddosomething
for their country. ] am referring toits
recent paternalistic reporting on the
attempt by Dr A Shejavali, General
Secretary of the Council of Chur-
ches, to get together all parties which
are honestly supporting Resolution
435.

Only a fool would expect this Party
Newspaper to show anv support for
a move lo unite the oppressed Nami-
bians, but the arrogance of its Editor
can no longer be ignored. Inthe edi-
tion of February 3 the ‘wise guy’ of
Namibian ‘journalism takes up issuc
with what he refers to as the ‘e1enaar-
dige inisiatief of Dr Shejavali.

Firstly he decides on what grounds
this initiative will enjoy the support
of all of them. Namely if the aim is

to get the parties outside the ‘puppet
show’ more approachable. The ques-
tion is: approachable for whom? His
group?

He actually has the cheek to
assume that these parties want to be
approachable to the surrogates of
South Africa, when allone has todo
isto deal with South Africa itself. He
then advises Dr Shejavali which par-
ties he should have approached fhe
were interested in reconciliation -
namely the little groups inthe MPC.

The poor manis such a victim of
hisown propaganda that he actual:
iv believes thes want ‘rcconuhahon
while they are beating up people at-
tending a peace rally and detaining
people under AG 9 and 26.

The writer of the editorial is upset
because Dr Shejasali ignored the
people inthe puppet show. If he had
read the invitation he would have

realised that itis not Dr Shejavahi, but
the agenda of the planned meeting,
which excludes thosein the MPC. It
1s Clearly stated in the invitation that
parties will discuss Resolution 435 as
it stands. Nobody in Namibia can
sull believe the MPC supports
Resolution 435. They have proven
their opposition $0 often.

Who remains for Dr Shejavali to
speak to, he asks: T would like to in-
form him a litle. Not to Justus
Garoch, buttothe Damara Counel,
which has openly stated its support
of Resolution 438 and which has
more support than Shipanga, kat-
jluongua, Mudge andthe rest of the
Bevryders, Arbeiders and NP put
together. Not to Peter Kalangula, but
to the CDA whose leeitimacy has
oeen adequately proven by the
dismal tailure of elements in the ar-
my and government to topple him,

and which supports Resolution 435.

Not the Swanu ‘dissidents’, but
Swanu under the leadership of
Kuzeeko Kangueehi, Swanu which
never dissented from its constitution
and pohcy, Swanu which supports
the implementauon of Resolution
435,

Other parties of which this ‘jour-
nalist is unaware are the Mbanderu
Council, the NIP, Nudo Pro-
gressives, Nanso and Namibia
Women’s Voice.

The soothsayer of Namibian
pohucaljournahsm predicts that i
will be impossible to get these parties
together. He obviously already has
information about this. Is it Koevoet
or the security police who will stop
the meeting?

He predicts that inthe event of uni-
ty being formed, it will Be unity in
dissension. Surely thisisthe business

of the parties involve}, and not his,

Surely it is only4olaries, cars,
houses and other benefits which
keeps the MPC together? Or is the
writer trying to tell us that the MPC
is united on AG 8, the Education
Teport, or a policy for developing
Namibia? [f so, the time has come to
give concrete evidence of it.

Why are the whites worried when
the CCN wants todo for the oppress-
ed what the NG Kerk has been doing
for the whites for years? Why is this
‘journalisy’ worried when the CCN
starts a unifying process but not
when Mr Cleary, working for South
Africa, started the MPC? Must any
initialive start with whites, must it be
pro South African?
