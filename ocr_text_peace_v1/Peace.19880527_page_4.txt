It is clear from the documentation
which is attendant upon Res 435 and
its accompanying resolutions, thatthe
Administrator-General and his
department wil] administer Namibia
during the transitional period, but
under conditions in which he will have
to repeal before the elections ‘‘all re-
maining discriminatory or restrictive
laws, regulations and administrative
measures’, which may inhibit the
holding of free and fair elections
(paragraph 7A of Western Proposals).
The arrangements for the release of all
political prisoners will also be the
responsibility of the Administrator.
General (paragraph 7B of Western Pro-
posals). These and al] other necessary
procedures to attain the object of free
and fair elections, will be overseen by,
ratified by, the UN Special Represen-
tative with the assistance of the
civilian component of UNTAG.

On the question of whether the
South African Police/SWA Police will
maintain law and order during the
transitional period: It should be noted
that the United Nations Transitional
Assistance GroupiUNTAG) is not in-
tended to be a police force. Thisisclear
if reference ts made to paragraph 9 of
the Western Proposais which state.
“Primary responsibility for mamtain-
ing law and order in Namibia shall rest
with the existing police forces.” This
Proposal was accepted by the
Secretary-General in his Explanatory
Statement which outlined the Special
Representative’s explicit respon.
sibilities to oversee the existing police
forces. Inthisregard, animportant role
of the Special Representative, assisted
by the civilian component of UNTAG,
will be to take measures against in-
timidation or interference with the |
electoral process, to accompany the ex-
isting police force and to ensure the
good conduct of these forces(paragraph
29 of the Secretary-General’s report
Document $/12827 and the Ex-
planatory Statement S/12869).
Earlier, the Western Proposal had
stated that the exiating police force
would be limited to “the carrying of
small armsin the norma! performance
of their duties” - acondition to be over-
seen by the UNTAG civilian/police
component (paragraph 9, Western
Proposals).
