Take It seriously

RECENT weoks have witnessed
Various revelations about the
extent af SA involvement in
the 1989 Namibian elections.

These revelations have once
more contimted the remarks
by Swapo betore and during
the process of elections that
South Afnea iad 2
agenda for Nanubia.

These revelations have once
more strengthened the belief
of many Namibians that SA
Nypged the elections in favour
ot the DTA.

(Tntal such time as the DTA
wand ats leaders prove ta the
Nation that they no longer re-
ceive money and advice from
SA, we will continue to doubt
their integrity and dedicanon
to peace and secunty in the
country.

Peace and independence has
cost the lives of many Namubi-
ans.

It is my belief that 1n inter-
national commission of inquiry
must beset up to investigate
the extent of SA involvement
in those elections.

Namibia's lasting peace,
independence and good human
relationships cannot be achic ved
without examining the root
cause of the war we fought and
ensure that it will not happen
again.

Ongandjera reply

WE as Ongandjera teaching
staff would like to request your
Newspaper to alr our comments
avis urticte in The Namibian
of May 17.

We disapree with the water
of the article who said that
teachers at Ongandjera are not
turning up for their classes.
And they (the teachers) are
also said to be distributors of
books.

I, as the Principal, know my
teachors and it is my duty to
see to it that they are doing
their work faithfully. I there-
fore want to correct the writer
ofthe article, and would liketo
pose to him/her the following
questions: |
- how many teachers are there
