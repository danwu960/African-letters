" ple. Its purpose should be the protec-
tion of life, property, and not based
on force and authority. We need a
higher standard of living and social
security in Namibia. We need ade-
quate food, shelter and medical ser-
vices, We need education for personal
growth and happiness. We need a
strong government.

In Namibia each ethnic govern-
ment has an education minister. The
purpose of this education is to equip
the African child for his place a5 a
labourer in Namibia. The ministry of
education is given unrestricted
powers to decide what schools should
exist, service for teachers and the
content of black education. It plans
{o separate one race from another.
Economically, politically and social-
ly, whites are at the apex and blacks
at the bottom. The emphasis is on
quantity and not quality. The educa-
tion of blacks is inferior and teaching
is done through the medium of ver-
naculars up to Standard Six, then
there is a sudden switch to learning
English and Afrikaans. The standard
of English in particular has dropped
disastrously. The black student is in
a terrible dilemma for he either ac-
cepts such education or gets no
education at all.

It is my contention that there is a
need for a clear national educational
policy in Namibia, and a compulsory
and unitary education system.

Blacks and whites should govern
the country in harmony; we share
many things and should share the
land under one government. We
share a common history and culture
and we can speak to one another in
our national languages. Namibia
needs a national symbol to give usa
sense of belonging og a nation.

Education should not separate
black and white; and children should
not be taught that blacks are lazy, in-
ferior, stupid and 80 on.

Education for black children is
scarce and inadequate. It is the cause
of all the political unrest in Namibia.

Namibians do not see ethnic
governments as their governments;
or the constilutions as their constitu:
tion; they have become politically-
divorced and frustrated,

In the final analysis, we need a
strong unitary government againat
external forces, because unity is
strength. We need new methods of
organisation, new skills, new in-
sights, new dreams and visions. We
need a climate in which Namibia can
keep peace with the world.

It is the time now to transform
Namibia into a better nation. It ia
time to put political differences asdie
and form one Namibia, one nation.
