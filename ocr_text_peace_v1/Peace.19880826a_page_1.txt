Reply to Kavari

ALLOW me tocomment on the letter
which appeared in The Namibian of
August 05, under the heading
“Pallacious’ written by V T Kavari.

I've been present al the Nanso con:
yrcsses since 1986¢ second congress) up
to this year with the fourth congress.
where I've experienced a spirit of
brotherhood.

What I have observed is that after &
speaker has delivered a speech, oppor:
tunity was given to the house for
discussion, questions, correction, ad.
dition, clarification, comment, etc.

I believe this was done so that with
the departure of the congress no com:
rades could go to their respective
places with unsolved problems as it ap
pears to be in your case.

I'm just wondering whether you
never got the opportunity to air your
viewsand to gopersonally tothe NEC
Members, instead of doing it in the
newspapers and to create a tasteless
spirit among the students, which 1s
totally unnecessaFy.

If you were at the congress you will
remember that comrade Shihwamen!
was the last person to clarify on this
issue. |

He explained that people have to
make the difference between 4 pro
gressive parly and a liberation move-
ment. He went on saying that pro-
gressive parties are mostly concerned
with ethnic issues, while Swapo which
‘sa liberation movement, is aimed at
liberating all the peace loving people
in Namibia irrespective of their col-
ours, ethnic groups, etc.

This is a fact that we, in Namibia
have to accept that Swapo is the only,
only armed movement that isfighting
(uniess, a8 Shinwameni said, “there is
another armed movement that 1s
hiding underground’)

Whatcomrade Steve saidat the con-
gress on this issue was positive and I,
with the majority accepted it, although
you differed as you said, in your letter.
Of course, minorities always differ!
That we have learned from history in
this country.

Lastly, let the truth not hurt ua,
please!
