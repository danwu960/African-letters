I BELIEVE IN Jimmy Cliff's song,

which says ‘Meeting in Africa’.

Iam referring to today’s news me-
diain which President Ronald Rea-

gan and his Secretary of State, Mr
George Schultz, revealed they back
and support the rebels, as South
Africa has confirmed that it supports
Renamo with food and ammunition,
in order to stage a coup on the Freli-

mo and MPLA Governments.

In the face of the world, Ronald
and George have declared war on the

Government of Angola by support-
ing Unita, a rebel movement. Is this
not another Afghanistan-type crisis?

Hardly a week before the meeting
between Gorbachev and Reagan in
Geneva, Reagan openly challenged
Gorbachev with his support for

Unita.

The military position of the
Americans and its Star Wars defence

programme clearly ignores the im-
portance of the Third World.

Were the talks between the USSR
and the USA leading to Armaged-

don, which inthis case is Angola? If

the Angolan Government calls upon

Russia for support, who can blame

them, but the cowboy administration
in Washington?

Ronald and George’s administra-
tion is going to support Unita

throughtheSouthAfrican Defence

Force, which is already doing that,

[would liketoinformboth Reagan
and Schultz that they have actedcon-

trary tothe interests of world cace,

Women and youth exhorted to unite against aparthe

AS WE usher ja this year of peace
and harmony, Swapo must assist the
women to take an active role in the
political fe of oar country. Nocoun-
try in which women do not have
equality with men, can be truly
democratic.

Women of our country and all the
whites who identify themselves as
truc and sincere citizens of Namibia.
who are yearning for a change,
should be accomodated in higher of-
fices and responsibilities in the party.

We must continue tenaciously
with the struggle. consistentls
demanding the prinaples of one man
one vote to be applied.

The first stepistopiveesery adull,
irrespective of race or creed, the right
to vote. When citizens enjoy equali-
ty of status with others, then the bar-
riers of race and colour will disap-
pear and people will mix freely
together and will work for the com-
mon good of society.

Our peopk are the masters of their

own lives, designers of their own
future, and dictators of their own
destiny. The illega! rule in Namibia
must be brought to an immediate
end.

No government can continue to
impose its rule coercively in the face
of the conscious defiance of the over-
whelming majority of its people.

L appeal to all progressive forces
which are fighting to establish ge-
nuineand democratic institutions in
the country to unite and form a
strong blog. No minorities, whether
they be BMlack or white, can fear a
united people.

While Swapo and all progressive
parties and institutions in ts coun-
try are intensifying the struggle for
emancipation and human dignity.
Swapo must not turn down honest
and authentic talks which could lead
toaceasefire. Swapo must talk to the
apartheid regime and not tothe self-
proclaimed government of national
unily.

LETTERS

Women of Namibia! The hour has
passed when women were made to be
mere spectators of events. Your
husbands are not paid adequate
wages. Your children are walking
around with empty stomachs and
they do not receive a proper educa-
tion. They are taught in segregated
schools and you do not have decent
houses and recreational facilities.

You do nat have equality. with
men. The voke of oppression is hur.
ting vou and sou should naw de-
mand vour rights

Youth ofthe country! Do not give
into intimidation. Wedo not havea
legaladministration inthis country.
Those whe proclaim power do not
have the mandate. You are the
citizens of today and tomorrow and
the salt of this nation. It is to you we
are looking for new values. Come out
resolutely. Stand up for justice to

prevail in Namibia.

Remember apartheid is hike cancer
inthe body politic of the country. It
is repugnant with the symptoms of
hatred, fear and relentless violence.

To draw up a constitution at this
juncture without the participation of
all the parts concerned, is fraudulent
and an indignity to our very ex-
istence, Regard it as null and void.

Close your ranks in the spirit of
peace and harmony Surmount your
problems with vigour and determin.
edefrors, discharge your duties with
honour and fulfill vour obligations
promptly. Eradicate the abominable
policy of apartheid from the face ot
our country.

The State. President of South
Africa ty not sincere in his proposal
for the implementation of Resolu-
tion 435, and he has no right to link
the independence of Namibia with
the withdrawal of the Cubans from
Angola.

The Cubans are in Angola at the
invitation of the Angolan Govern-

ment, and ever since they went to that ;

country in 1975 to date, they havenot
attempted to violate the territorial
boundaries of Namibia or. South
Africa.

I see no logic m the proposal of the
State President. One would have ex-
pected Mr Botha to be more realistic
and practical on this desperate issue
of Namibia. An issue which took so
many years to discuss inthe interna-
tional forum.

Angola is a sovereign member
state of the United Nations and
under the present Charter of the
United Nations. No government or
individual has the right to impose
dictates on that government.

JP W Botha, as the leader of South
Africa, can only have the Cubans
withdrawn from Angola through
peacetul negotiations and not
critical and enipty proposals based
On malicious intrigues.

YOU HAVE GIVEN Vice Bishop
Kamecta space in your newspaper to
volce his opinion. I request thesame
Opportunity since you call yourself
achamplon for freedom of speech.

Mr Kameceta claims that the in-
dependence of Namibia is an in-
alienable right, and that itisdemand-
ed without conditions attached. He
iscight, but why does he, and his par-
ty, Swapo, refuse to acknowledge any
other political opinion in this de-
mand for independence?

Why doesn't Mr Kameeta use his
high office to ensure justice, peace
and freedom for eery Namibian?
He is aware of the fact that Swapo
does not tolerate opposition. He
knows that everybody opposing
Swapo will be subject to arbitrary
punishment or even execution
without a fair trial. Mr Kameeta
should support the call made by The
Namibian on Swapotoensurea fair
hearing for those who are accused of
being spies for South Africa.

Mr Kameeta should be aware of
the fact that many political parties in
Nainibia have urged Swapoto be an
equal partner in their opposition to
South Africa. He should also know
that Swapo refuses to drop the adjec-

tive ‘sole and authentic represen.

tative of the people of Namibia’. Ms
Lister should inform Mr Kameeta of
what her experiences are concerning
this imposed status on Swapo. Mr
Kameeta, who has vowed to preach
love, peace and righteousness,
should be inthe front to ensure that
every Namibia be granted the right
andthe opportunity to work towards
independence of this country.

Mr Kameeta knows that Swapo
regards violence as the only viable
means of allaining independence tor
Namibia, but does he consider the
fact that the majority people in this
country are peaceloving Christians
and thus prefer a negotiated
settlement?

Mr Kamecta calls for boycotts and
disinvestment and calls the potential
suffering of the majority of people
‘empty phrases’. Simullaneously this
Vice Bishop demands that ‘all peo-
ple must have the right to decent
housing, and bring up their families
incomfort and secunty. Free medica!
care and hospitalisation must be pro-
vided for all, with special care for

senior citizens, mothers and small
children. The aged and disabled must
be fully cared for by the State’,

Has it occurred to Mr Kameeta
that foreign investment is vital to
achieve these aims” Mr Kameeta ts
fully aware of the fact that Swapo
and the CCN regularly call on inter-
national financial support to
alleviate the plight of the people.
Why then should only his party and
is followers benefit from financial
aid and not the majority of the
people?

Will Mr Kameeta care to tell the
public how much he earns and how
much he pays i taxes? Will Mr
Kamecta be prepared to inform the
people of this country about the
lifestyle of those who profess to fight
tor independence and liberation
about ther contribution towards the
alleviation of the suffering peaplein
the form of financial contributions?

Can Mr Kamectainform the publicof

whathe proposes shauld be done to
obtain sufficient funds to attain what
all the people in Namibia desire?
Mr contention is that Swapo is
guilty of the most atrocious
discrimination against people. Mr
Kameeta is actively engaged in
Swapo's political activities, this
inakes him guilty of discriminating
against his own people too, Accor-

ding to the Oxford dictionary,
discrimination means to ‘make a
distinction, to give unfair treatment,
especially because of prejudice’.
Swapo and Mr Kameeta call
everybody who does not comply with
their conditions and with their opi-
mons, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pels etc. Everybody who dares to
speak against Swapo is threatened
and intimidated. Every person who
does not support Swapo is being
discriminated against. This ts
definitely not what the majority of
Namibians will support: this is what
the majority ofthe Namubians want
eradicated,

Mr Kameecta claims his fame and
right to speak about political matters
on his attest and detention. For any
law-abiding citizen, especially for
devoted Christians, defiance of the
lawis detestable. If Mr Kamectaasa
Vice Bishop and even more as a
Swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
ahenable right to self-determination,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not suppartan
organisation which sees only
violence as a moans of achieving

what they desire, namely, to take over
power of this country.
Mr Nujoma has declared more

than once that Swapo is not in-
\erested in powersharing, but onlyin
power itself, During his recent pro-
paganda tour for Swapo in West Ger-
many, Mr Kameeta has proven that
heis against any form of opposition
to Swapo and that he disputes the
right of freedom of speech of a Ger-
man citizen in his own country. With

this act added to his political antics

against the people of this country, Mr

Kameeta has disqualified himselfof

freedom, justice and peace.

especially because of prejudice’.
Swapo and Mr Kameeta call
everybody who does not comply with
their conditions and with their opi-
nions, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pets etc. Everybody who dares to
speak against Swapo is threatened
and intimidated. Every person who
does not support Swapo is being
discriminated against. This is
definitely not what the majority of
Namibdians will support; this is what
the majority ofthe Namibians want
eradicated,

Mr Kameeta claims his fame and
right to speak about political matters
on his arrest and detention. For any
law-abiding citizen, especially for
devoted Christians, defiance of the
law is detestable. if Mr Kameetaasa
Vice Bishop and even more as a
Swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
alienable right to self-detesmination,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not support an
Organisation which sees only
violence as a means of achleving

what they desire, namety, to takeover
power of this country.
Mr Nujoma has declared more
than once that Swapo {fs not in-
terested in powersharing, bux only tn
power itself. During his recent pro-
paganda tour for Swapo in West Ger-
many, Mr Kameeta has proven thal
heis against any form of opposition
to Swapo and that he disputes the
right of freedom of speech of a Ger-
man citizen in hisown country. With
this act added to his political atsties
against the people of this country, Mr
Kameeta has disqualified himself of
claiming to be a champion for
freedom, Justice and peace.

It you try to be objective and

False statement

PLEASE permit me to answer to
the embarrassing statement
Swapo does the same, but nobody
complains .... in The Namibian of
May 16.

The angry residents and their
tribal chief, in and around Om-
balantu in northern Namibia, are
totally against the actions of the
South African Police and Defence
Force and not against Swapo.

Obviously the people in the
north are annoyed by the South
Afncan Police and Defence Force’s
“systematic and cleverly planned’
manner of waiting until the
harvesting period before these units
come in and destroy their many
months of hard work.

In Windhoek, the Police
spokesman’s comment on the in-
cidents, in my reasoning, is alarm-
ing. His words ‘... Swapo does the
same but nobody complains ..’ are
absurd and embarrassing and
perhape deliberately said to ignore
the complaints and the truth of the

The statement ‘Swapo does the
same’ is patently false since Swapo

has no military vehicles, which ac-
cording to the complaints, the
SADF drove through mahangu
fields and homesteads. How can
someone from the north be ex-
pected to believe such a statement?

While the police and army claim
to be the defenders of the people,
the Namibians themselves have re-
jected this claim, since Namibians
have experienced untold crimes at
the hands of these forces. These

We do fear the action of these

NAMIBIAN independence is
delayed by the entire western world
with their intentions of exploiting
our country's natural resources and
promoting the iNegal occupation of
Namibia by the South African
Government.

In 1978 the United Nations pass-
ed a Resoluuon (UNSCR 435)
which was to pave the way for our
independence through UN-
supervised elections.

Both Swapo and South Africa
had agreed to the implementation
of Resolution 435, but when
Reagan came {0 power in
Washington, he and South Africa
brought in the linkage issue. This
is NOW made a precondition to our
independence.

The Cuban Internationalists
have been in Angola almost three
years prior to the introduction of
Resolution 435. They were only
found to be a threat after six years.

This is a feeble excuse and ploy
by western capitalists regarding
Namubia.

We in Namibia have tried on-
three occasions to bring and end to
the shedding of blood and the suf-
fering of our people, but all were
in vain. In Geneva in 1981, Swapo
was ready to sign a ceasefire and
put Resolution 435 into operauion,
and this was repeated in Lusaka in
1984 and on Cape Verde later that
year, but the South African
Government turned a deal ear.

Mr P W Botha told the world
that Swapo was the one delaying
independence and opting for
violence, whereas Swapo had stated
often that a ceasefire was the only
way to end the war.

If Mr P W Botha could just tell
us openly that he is afraid of a
Swapo victory if Resolution 438 ts
implemented. Swapa would win
the elections overwhelmingly,
which 16 why the Reagan Adc-
ministrauon is backing Pretoria on
the Cuban tssue.

The South African Government
Is again playing with us by saying
that Swapo must talk to the interim
government in Windhoek. Why
should Swapo talk to their sur-

NAMIBIAN independence Is
delayed by the entire western world
with their intentions of exploiting
our country's natural resources and
promoting the illegal occupation of
Namibia by the South African
Government.

In 1978 the United Nations pass-
ed a Resolution (UNSCR 435)
which was to pave the way for our
independence through UN-
supervised elections.

Both Swapo and South Africa
had agreed to the implementation
of Resolution 435, but when
Reagan came [to power in
Washington, he and South Africa
brought in the linkage issue. This
is now made a precondition to our
independence.

The Cuban Internationalists
have been in Angola almost three
years prior to the introduction of
Resolution 435. They were only
found to be a threat after six years.

This is a feeble excuse and ploy
by western capitalists regarding
Namibia.

We in Namibia have tried on-

three occasions to bring and end to
the shedding of blood and the suf-

fering of our people, but all were |

in vain. In Geneva in 1981, Swapo
was ready lo sign a ceasefire and
put Resolution 435 into @peration,
and this was repeated in Lusaka in
1984 and on Cape Verde later that
year, but the South African
Government turned a deaf ear.
Mr P W Botha told the world
that Swapo was the one delaying
independence and opting for
violence, whereas Swapo had stated

often that a ceasefire was the only —

way to end the war.

if Mr P W Botha could just tell
us openly that he is afraid of a
Swapo victory if Resolution 435 is
implemented. Swapo would win
the elections overwhelmingly,
which is why the Reagan Ad-

ministration is backing Pretoria on |

the Cuban issue.

The South African Government

is again playing with us by saying
that Swapo must talk to the interim
government in Windhoek. Why
should Swapo talk to their sur-
rogates? The country is not oc-

cupied by Mudge-Shipanga- —

Katjiuongua, but by Pretoria.

They talk of reconciliation, but —

AN OPEN LETTER TO
MR SAREL BECKER
AND FOLLOWERS

OVER THE years, when apartheid
was in its raw stages, it was mark-
ed with doors for ‘Whites only’.
‘Whites only’ could enter these
doors, regardless of their religion,
social standing, tradition or race.

The only precondition was that
the skin colour be ‘white’.

The man with the black skin had
to keep away from ‘your’ regions
and reservations.

1 will not ask what you have
against the colour of my skin, Mr
Becker. By maintaining this rigid
attitude, you have made your
message clear to the blacks of
Namibia. As far as you are con-
cerned, there is no compromise on
apartheid without a colour change.

ironically, the very segregation
you are now seeking, was provid-
ed in the past. Someone was wise
enough to foresee conflicting
nature of the white man and black
man, and kept them apart. Your
forbears were in Holland and there
the chances of keeping vour race
pure, were perfect

On what grounds can you now
fence in the black man to safeguard
the punty of your white race if you,
yourself, have broken the natural
segregation by crossing the ocean?

Of course we dare not overlook
the fact that your forbears brought
the first hight of Christian faith and -
civilisation into the most southern *
part of Africa. This opened our
eyes (o new horizons of education,
civilisation, faith and progress.

Incidentally, the white man also
introduced to us the first spark of
the gun, the very evil he suffers
under today. In fact the mass
slaughter of blacks on December 16
1836, is a testive day for your
government - contrary to the Chris-
Han faith which strives for peace,
love and unity.

You came to Africa, heavily
armed and with apartheid.

Surely you are an advocate of
‘whites only’ churches, a religion
practised, understood and accep-
(able to only a small part of the
community. With the help of God
we have partly outgrown that stage.

1 was told I could get a job i in the
building construction industry in
Tsumeb, and had to see a man at
the Tsumeb Municipality. He told
me to come back the following
morning at 07h00, which I did, and
he made me wait all day. I was
eventually told I could not get the
job, and then after a friend of mine
again requested, I was told to go
to the Municipality once again.

When | did so, the man told me
there were no jobs for Ovambo-
speaking people, but only
Damaras, Namas and Coloureds.

Some of our brothers in govern-
ment offices treat others on a tribal
and discriminatory basis. While the
Ovambo-speaking people are those
who are suffering the most, one has
to hear that they are ‘thieves and
terrorists’, and they are
discriminated against in job
situations.

| had used my own money to go
to Tsumeb for that job, and had no
place to sleep and nothing to eat.

Blacks always blame the whites
for discrimination and racism, but
some of our own people, like the
one who dealt with me at the
Municipality, are oppressing their
own people.

We should learn from these
mistakes so we should not make the
same mistakes tn the future.

Our country is torn by war and
this situation will only be resolved
if the people of the country can
work hand in hand for peace. This
peace will only come through love,
and an understanding of our duty
to the nation, and if we forget the
differences among ourselves and
see one another as brothers and

Sanctions: Yes

THRE CALL tor total cconomic
sanctions against apartherd South
Atnica is justified. South Africa has
rejected all reasonable demands to
do away with the outdated and
degrading system of apartheid and
oppression of the blacks.

The promoters of economic
sanctions have the real interests of
the oppressed masses of South
Africa and Namibia at heart; and
economic sancuons is the alter-
native to total war. In fact
economic sanctions is a call for
‘peaceful change’ to enable the
blacks to govern in the land of their
birth and creation.

Those who are against economic
sanctions are only trying to protect
their own interests and exploitation
of the blacks. The claim that the
blacks would suffer if economic
sancuions were applied, should be
rejected with the contempt it
deserves. The blacks are suffering
already and additional temporary
suffering won’t matter to us as long
as freedom is achieved.

The blacks have no economic in-
terests to protect and defend - their
main interest NOW is to liberate
themselves at all costs.

The US and British attitude is
Clearly capitalistic and self-interest
aimed at protecting the in-
vestments. The fear of economic
loss is stronger to them than the
freedom and lives of the blacks in
apartheid South Africa. It ig
because of the double standards of
the Western powers that blacks
have lost interest in slogans like
‘democracy’ Blacks lived in peace
and harmony until the arrival of
the white settlers and colonisers.

It fills one with dismay to hear
about blacks saying that apartheid
is dead in Namibia. Apartheid in
Namibia as still alive and kicking,
even the socalled black ‘ministers’
complain about apartheid meted
outto them by secretaries of other
“Mintsters’,

The abolition of apartheid is not
what we are calling for - we are not
fighting for reforms - we want to
GOVERN this country. We are
fighting for the nght to decide our
own destiny and our destiny 1s not
linked to apartheid or neo-
colomalism.

The whites of this country are
not prepared to change or ready
themselves for change. They still
believe in their oppressive doctrines
und dogmas.

Even the Secretary for Finance
is calling for methods to prepare
against economic sanchons, instead
of calling for drastic changes in the
status quo in order to meet the
reasonable demands of the op-
pressed masses.

thing: they may be in a temporary
postion to delay independence. Dut

They should femember that we

We hear that the army 1s 80 per-

but who are the 20 percent? They
are the elite, the white officers, the
ones in charge. The 80 percent
blacks are there only to run errands
and to be ordered to kill their own

If the whites are prepared to die

should remember that violence
breeds violence - they have practis-

Dear Mr Cleary

YOU too have done some ‘remarkable’
pieces of writing, most recently in
Leadership (Volume $ 1986 Number 2),
in which you measure the success of ihe
interim government by means of the
vague generaltsation of ‘inclusivity’.
This ‘government’, you say, seeks to in-
volve all parties and also to draw to
these same parties, the support
previously enjoyed by those outside it.

May we remind you that there are six
parties (some in name only) which en-
joy membership of the interim govern-
ment. Membership of ‘other parties’,
however minor their support, who have
shown interest in the interim govern-
ment, has been turned down, and I refer
in particular to the recent HNP request
for membership of the ‘Constitutional
Council’.

‘Inclusivity’, therefore, hardly seems
to be the goal of this interim
government,

You have not explained why the DTA
prefers to operate outside your con-
sultancy service, and it has been wide-
ly reported (not only in The Namibian)
that there has been a breakdown in
communication between yourself and
Mr Dirk Mudge, an interim government
miniMer you claim to represent,

What is perhaps of note, is your
— geference to the ‘Transitional Govern-

| ment’, rather than the ‘Government of

National Unity’, Even you can no-

longer claim that there is “unity” in their
ranks, any more than you can claim that
there is ‘consensus’ on the question of
AG 86 despite socalled mnanimnous

resolutions concerning the removal of —

ethnic and racial discrimination.

As to ‘marketing the truth’, I believe
bia does: just that ‘

“that The Na
whereas you are spending a lot of tax-
payer's money on marketing what !
believe is a myth - mamely, that an in-

terim government such as we have at

demned violence and atrocities commit-
ted by Swapo and therefore | take it for
granted that vou condone one form of
violence and condemn another suiting
your own political whims and
aspirations.

As the majority of my countrymen
I condemn violence of any form to
achieve political aims. Nobody denies
that members of the security forces do
commit violence against members of the
local population. Such members are
however brought before court and | can
substantiate this statement with a list of
trials. | do however assume that you
doubt the impartiality and in-
dependence of our courts of law.
However it may be there is not one case
Swapo has brought before a couriof
justice to try one of its members czaxn-
mitting affocities against innocent
civilians.

On the’ contrary: Swapo cold-
bloodediy murder a mother and young
child in Grootfontein. The same peo-
ple killed two parents in front of their
two daughters on a farm near Okahan-
dja. After one of them was sentenced
to death and subsequently hanged,
Swapo hailed him as a martyr.

, Swapo assassinated Chief Kapuuo
And Headman' Tolvo Shiyagaya and
‘fem Nujoma’ praises them for their
a ‘ ic ctur ke Elifas, Pastor saat and
in most of Swapo’s publications
which are circulated as widely as possi-
ble, this organisation lists the numbers
of landmines they have laid. Often the
mames of people who were murdered
also appear on these documents. Swapo
also acknowledges abductions of young
men and women. These atrocities are
lauded as acts in the struggle for in-
dependence. Mr Katjavivi says people
are not abducted, but only taken to be
re-educated.

Neither you, Dr Shejavali, nor any
of your colleagues have ever condemn-

ed these senseless atrocities against in- —

nocent civilians. On numerous occa-
sions, internally and abroad, you have
publicly called for support for Swapo
in its struggle against the ‘oppressors’.
Not once have you called on Swapo to
cease the atrocities against civilians.
Power pylons, electric installations,
water pumps, reservoirs and telecom-
munications links are being sabotaged

by Swapo. These acts of sabotage are

pot aimed. at the security forces, but
vagainst the local population. How can
‘a christian like you, Dr Shejavali, re-
main silent when Swapo sabotages the

3 ter'supply to innocent civilians who
have.no bart. in the war? a

i a el if ih
H tp
Is my assumption justified that you
support Swapo’s numerous calls and
statements for the increase of violence;
that you reiterate threats made by
Swapo leaders that Swapo will
demonstrate its power if her
unreasonable demands are not being
met; that you know Swapo has in-
timidated inhabitants of this country by
threatening to step up their acts of
violence which includes specifically
bombings?

The murderous attack on civilians in
Walvis Bay on August 2 was one of
those bombings which Swapo threaten-
ed to execute. If this is not the fact, then
you Dr Shejavali, should request Swapo
to deny responsibility for this atrocitiy
and those recently committed in
Katutura and Khomasdal as well as
those numerous acts of terrorism
against our own people.

You are in favour of the implemen- |
tation of Resolution 435, so am [| and |
the majority of our people. But we de-
mand this be on the basis of a fair
democratic election. Swapo’s President
has on several occasions stated
categorically that Swapo is not in-
__ terested in democracy in Namibia, but
_only'in the total cratrol and power over,

j this country andJour people.
-Swapo has repeatedly demanded that

the control and power over Namibia

and our people should be handed over

directly to Swapo, Swapo consistently

rejects the democratic gestures of

_ leaders of the transitional government

to deliberate with them to find an ac-

‘ceptable, peaceful and lasting solution

to our political problems. Swapo claims
to be the ‘sole and authentic represen-

‘tative of the people of Namibia’.

Nobody else, not even the rest of the
/Ai-//Gams group, but Swapo, has a
say in the future of our people and you,
paradoxically, support this atrocity.
You, Dr Shejavali, have a calling and
an obligation as a Christian to search

in the name of God for righteousness,

justice and peace for all men irrespec-

_ tive of their race, sex, creed or colour
' ~ or political aspirations - and yet you

""AN OPEN LETTER TO DR
ABISAI SHEJAVALI

NEITHER YOU, Dr Shejavali, nor any
of your colleagues of the Council of
Churches (CCN) have as yet reacted to
the barbarous bomb attack on innocent
civilians in Walvis Bay on August 2.
Nobody expects you as a Christian to

should condemn all forms of violence.
You did not and have never before con-
demned violence and atrocities commit-
ted by Swapo and therefore I take it for

and acoused him of being
Swapo convert, and even:

spokesman.

I want to ask Mr Shipanga

propagate in the Bill of Rights if he
does not want Professor Lombard to

education is given unrestricted
powers to decide what schools should
exist, service for teachers and the
content of black education. It plans
{o separate one race from another.
Economically, politically and social-
ly, whites are at the apex and blacks
at the bottom. The emphasis is on
quantity and not quality. The educa-
tion of blacks is inferior and teaching
is done through the medium of ver-
naculars up to Standard Six, then
there is a sudden switch to learning
English and Afrikaans. The standard
of English in particular has dropped
disastrously. The black student is in
a terrible dilemma for he either ac-
cepts such education or gets no
education at all.

It is my contention that there is a
need for a clear national educational
policy in Namibia, and a compulsory
and unitary education system.

Blacks and whites should govern
the country in harmony; we share
many things and should share the
land under one government. We
share a common history and culture
and we can speak to one another in
our national languages. Namibia
needs a national symbol to give usa
sense of belonging og a nation.

Education should not separate
black and white; and children should
not be taught that blacks are lazy, in-
ferior, stupid and 80 on.

Education for black children is
scarce and inadequate. It is the cause
of all the political unrest in Namibia.

Namibians do not see ethnic
governments as their governments;
or the constilutions as their constitu:
tion; they have become politically-
divorced and frustrated,

In the final analysis, we need a
strong unitary government againat
external forces, because unity is
strength. We need new methods of
organisation, new skills, new in-
sights, new dreams and visions. We
need a climate in which Namibia can
keep peace with the world.

It is the time now to transform
Namibia into a better nation. It ia
time to put political differences asdie

in the interim government propagan-
da mouthpiece of November 3, which
criticised church-run schools in the
territory.

Mr Andrew Matjila, Education
Minister, said that we were disad-
vantaged hecause we were
undernourished.

Church schools are contributing
much to our country, and our eves
and minds are kept open in these
schools. We have a fair system of
education, and we feel at home.

Coming to Mr Matjila’s point that
we are locked into our hostels: this
is not true. Everyone has the right
to go home with the permission of
staff members, and this is a sign of
order. We are protected by the church
as future leaders of this country. .

Truly speaking, we are thankful for
the good we are getting. We eat in
order to survive and not to get fat as
he is doing. If he wants to make us
fat, then they have to implement a
system of equal education in this
country.

Mr Matjila should also not confuse
himself about Swapo and the Coun.
cil of Churches. They are using the
money for peaceful means, while he
and his colleagues have grabbed
possession of the country, including
the education system.

The things mentioned in that
report are occurrences at schools
resorting under National Education.
Many of them are undernourished,
and they are also locked up, like at
the Augustineum, where students
are afraid of the Koevoet security
guards.

When | look at what happens at
State schools, I do not fee] bad about
the situation in which myself and my
colleagues at church schools find
ourselves. What happened at the
Augustineum, Mr Matjila? There
they are locked up and are forbidden
from participating in student
organisations, such as Nanso.

This is a sign that their rights have
been taken away. We are happy to be
at church schools, because our minds
are free, and we have the opportun)-
ty to air our political views.

Mr Matjila, think before you speak.
Leave the church schools in peace.

Myself and fellow Namibian
students dream of the day when
equal and fair education will be
granted to all. Education without
liberation is worthless.

The things mentioned in that
report are occurrences at schools
resorting under Nationa] Education.
Many of them are undernourished,
and they are also locked up, like at
the Augustineum, where students
are afraid of the Koevoet security

When I look at what happens at
State schools, I do not feel bad about
the situation in which myself and my
colleagues at church schools find
ourselves. What happened at the
Augustineum, Mr Matjila? There
they are locked up and are forbidden
from participating in student
organisations, such as Nanso.

This is a sign that their rights have
been taken away. We are happy to be
at church schools, because our minds
are free, and we have the opportuni.
ty to air our political views.

Mr Matjila, think before you speak.
Leave the church schools in peace.

Myself and fellow Namibian
students dream of the day when
equal and fair education will be
granted to all. Education without
liberation is worthless.

painted blue, green and red. Tradi-

The peace rally was opened with o

| 1986. OAME .and faded away as
qitickly.as the rainbow and 1967 has
For us, the
masses of Namibia, i it is now time to
reflect on the happenings of the past
year. Waa it a successful year as far
_ as the struggle is concerned? Did we
achieve what we set out to achieve,
and if not why?

First of all we must find answers
to these questions before we can plan
for the new year. The aim of our plan-

should be to make a success out
of failures of the past and to
achieve our independence. It is aleo
now time for us to state our aims and
purpose as clearly as never before.
We should state our views without
fear or favour.

Our aim was and is and always
shall be the independence of our
country. It must be every Namibian’s
wish and desire to be free ... and |
mean free in the real sense of the
word.

Our independence is not
negotiable. We have negotiated for
too long hence the long delay in ob-
taining our desired independence.
Our direction should be very clear ...
independence now and at all costs.
We should stop these half-hearted ef.
forts. We should go all out to liberate
our country.

The call and onus is on us to unite
the divided people of Namibia into
one cohesive liberation front or
movement.

The unity I am talking about is not
unity for the sake of shouting that we
are united ... 1 mean unity of purpose
and action ... the purpose being our
liberation. We must have the purpose
of fighting the common enemy and
even more ... to defeat the enemy. We
have nothing to lose but our chains.

We must learn from our mistakes
and those of our forefathers and rec-
tify them before it is too late. We
should also learn from other African

HH

2 time for talk about unity is
overdue. It is now time to act
. It is time to involve all the
amibians in the unity of purpose

ive
The time for talk about unity is
long overdue. It is now time to act
unity. It is time to involve all the
Namibians in the unity of purpose
process.

The masses must ask their leaders
to unite them for the sake of our in-
dependence and beloved fatherland.
We should not give the enemy the
chance of further dividing our
already divided people. The enemy
did it by creating eleven ethnic
governments. He did it by buying
and bribing some of our people. He
did it by his political ideology - ter.
ming some of us terrorists and com.
munists. He ts still doing it with his
radio and TV broadcasts. Finally he
is doing it by taking some black
money: mongerers into towns to
create a black middle class-cum-elite.
The irony is that these blacks think
they are destroying apartheid. The
truth is that they are being used to
strengthen apartheid.

Multiracialism and liberalism have
never been the friends of those under
oppression. All these terms tend to
create divisions in the liberation
movement and some confused blacks
tend to think that by associating with
whites, they are better than other
blacks. History has proved that white
liberalism is an enemy of the strug.
gle for freedom. Whites cannot
enslave us and at the same time
claim to be our liberators. Freedom
is not a gift, its a victory, and that
victory will only be achieved by the
blacks themselves. History has pro-
ved that whites in the ranks of the
liberation movement tend to be spies
and informers. Whites tend to be in
control or to contro! whether they are
in the majority or minority.
Wherever the whites went, they went
to control.

Socialism is the basis of the African
culture and also part of the African
revial and struggle to regain the lost
glory and freedom. Socialism is a way
of life for the African and not a
foreign, imported ideology as claim-
ed by white capitalism. Blacks own.
ed everything commonly, even the
moet powerful kings did not claim or
own private land or waterholes.
Socialism should not only be preach-
ed, but practiced ... in fact it should
be lived. We as socialists should put
the example of being true socialists.
We should stop living as capitalists
= _ aaa lUUlUlUler ll

while preaching socialism. The peo-
ple should be prepared for the Great
Socialist Revolution which is going
to tranaform the entire Namibian
society.

Namibian masses must stand
together and ca]] and end to the op-
pression meted out to you. If the
leaders are not taking any initiative,
then you are at liberty to take actions
to liberate the country. Let us make
1987 the final year of our struggle for
independence.

We have been hearing about peace
and reconciliation in Namibia ...
what a misuse of words and terms.
The fact is there is no peace in
Namibia and there won't be peace in
Namibia unless the enemy is driven
out and we resume our rightful place
and control of our country. There
won't be reconciliation in Namibia
between the oppressed and op-
pressors. What are we reconciling?
Oppression? No way. The real peace
and reconciliation will come when
the black man has come to his rights
and power. We cannot talk about
peace and reconciliation in Namibia
unless we are trying to bluff
ourselves as the white liberals are do-
ing today. To the white liberals we
aay: you cannot achieve or solve
anything by working with your pup-
peta or tamed blacka. The key to the
solution of the Namibian problem
lies with the true blacks ... the
revolutionaries, We are holding the
key to speace, freedom and tranquili-
ty in Namibia. —

| anbkly-a th and faded away as
the rainbow and 1967 has
ratte For us, the struggling
masses of Namibia, it is now time to
reflect on the happenings of the past
year. Was it a successful year as far
_ as the struggle is concerned? Did we
achieve what we set out to achieve,
and if not why?

First of all we must find answers
to these questions before we can plan
for the new year. The aim of our plan-

should be to make a success out
of failures of the past and to
achieve our independence. It is aleo
now time for us to state our aims and
purpose as clearly as never before.
We should state our views without
fear or favour.

Our aim was and is and always
shall be the independence of our
country. It must be every Namibian’s
wish and desire to be free ... and |
mean free in the real sense of the
word. -

Our independence is not
negotiable. We have negotiated for
too long hence the long delay in ob-
taining our desired independence.
Our direction should be very clear ...
independence now and at all coats.
We should stop these half-hearted ef.
forts. We should go all out to liberate
our country. |

The call and onus is on us to unite
the divided people of Namibia into
one cohesive liberation front or
movement.

The unity I am talking about is not
unity for the sake of shouting that we
are united ... 1 mean unity of purpose
and action ... the purpose being our
liberation. We must have the purpose
of fighting the common enemy and
even more ... to defeat the enemy. We
have nothing to lose but our chains.

We must learn from our mistakes
and those of our forefathers and rec-
tify them before it is too late. We
should also learn from other African
countries.

The time for talk about unity is
long overdue. It is now time to act
unity. It is time to involve all the
Namibians in the unity of purpose
process,

The masses must ask their leaders
to unite them for the sake of our in.
The time for talk about unity is
long overdue. It is now time to act
unity. It is time to involve all the
Namibians in the unity of purpose

The masses must ask their leaders
to unite them for the sake of our in-
dependence and beloved fatherland.
‘We should not give the enemy the
chance of further dividing our
already. divided people. The enemy
did it by creating eleven ethnic
governments. He did it by buying
and bribing some of our people. He
did it by his political ideology - ter-
ming some of us terrorists and com-
munists. He is stil) doing it with his
radio and TV broadcasts. Finally he
is doing it by taking some black
money-mongerers into towns to
create a black middle class-cum-elite.
The irony is that these blacks think
they are destroying apartheid. The
truth is that they are being used to
strengthen apartheid.

Multiracialism and liberalism have
never been the friends of those under
oppression. All these terms tend to
create divisions in the liberation
movement and some confused blacks
tend to think that by associating with
whites, they are better than other
blacks. History has proved that white
liberalism is an enemy of the atrug-
gle for freedom. Whites cannot
enslave us and at the same time
claim to be our liberators. Freedom
is not a gift, its a victory, and that
victory will only be achieved by the
blacks themselves. History has pro-
ved that whites in the ranks of the
liberation movement tend to be spies
and informers. Whites tend to be in
control or to control whether they are
in the majority or minority.
Wherever the whites went, they went
to control.

Socialism is the basis of the African
culture and also part of the African
‘revial and struggle to regain the lost
glory and freedom. Socislisnis a way
of life for the Afriean at not a
foreign, imported ideology as claim-
ed by white capitalism. Blacks own-
ed everything commonly, even the
moet powerful kings did not claim or
own private land or waterholes.
Socialism should not only be preach-
ed, but practiced ... in fact it should
ba lived. We as socialists should put
‘thy exaingls of being true,socialiste.

while preaching socialism. The peo-
ple should be prepared for the Great
Socialist Revolution which is going
to tranaform the entire Namibian
society. 7

Namibian masses must stand
together and cal] and end to the op-
preasion meted out to you. If the
leaders are not taking any initiative,
then you are at liberty to take actions
to liberate the country. Let us make
1987 the final year of our struggle for
independence.

We have been hearing about peace
and reconciliation in Namibia ..
what a misuse of words and terms.
The fact is there is no peace in
Namibia and there won't be peace in
Namibia unless the enemy is driven
out and we resume our rightful place
and control of our country. There
won't be reconciliation in Namibia
between the oppressed and op-
pressors. What are we reconciling?
Oppression? No way. The real peace
and reconciliation will come when
the black man has come to hia rights
and power. We cannot talk about
peace and reconciliation in Namibia
unleas we are trying to bluff
ourselves as the white liberals are do-
ing today. To the white liberals we
say: you cannot achieve or solve
anything by working with your pup-
pets or tamed blacka. The key to the
solution of the Namibian problem
lies with the true blacks ... the
revolutionaries, We are holding the
key to peace, freedom and tranquili-
ty in Namibia, ee

First and foremost I would like to

this company was given a green light
by South Africa in 1970, four years
after the UN General Assembly
revoked South Africa’s mandate to
rule Namibia. Was Rossing ignorant
of UN Decree Number 1 which clear-
ly states: “No person or entity,

ACCORDING to a report published
in the Republikein of March 6 1987,
interim government Minister, An.
dreas Shipanga, ‘sharply criticised’
and expressed his ‘disappointment’
about certain statementa the Vicar
General of the Roman Catholic
Church, Father Bernhard Nor-
dkamp, had allegedly made during
an address given at a youth seminar,
which, again according to the report,
is said to have been organised by the
Council of Churches. The report
relates to what Mr Shipanga 1s alleg.
ed to have said during a meeting of

the National Assembly on March 5

1987.

Mr Shipanga, according to the
report, bases his claim about what

the Vicar General had said during

the youth seminar held at Dobra, on

a letter by an unidentified “Win-

~ dhoek student'’ which letter was
- published in the Windhoek Observer

of February 28, 1987. The “student”
alleges, inter alia, that Father Nor-

- dkamp had said that “law and order
are sin”. For the purposes of this

statement it is sufficient to state that
the letter contains further very
serious distortions and outright un-
truths. It represents nothing but a
very ill-considered attempt to amear
the Roman Catholic Church and to
discredit the Vicar General, whose
commitment to bringing about
justice with peace in a truly Chris-
tian society in Namibia is well

| known

Against this background, Mr
Shipanga's criticism ie evidently un-

| warranted and uncalled for. Yet Mr

Shipanga, who holds hia high office
by virtue of an appointment by the
Routh African Government, sean fit

to simply repeat these untrue allege:
tions of what the Vicar General is

taken to have said, relying on
nothing more than an anonymous |

Cabinet minister can simply accept
serious allegations without further
verification. Mr Shipanga’s failure to
check his facta is even more frighten-
ing in view of the extremely wide ar-
bitrary executive powers which are
vested in him. and his colleagues in
the Cabinet of the interim govern-
ment by virtue of numerous socall-
ed security laws, which would clear-
ly require the greatest measure of —
restraint and responsibility. These
laws not only offend against fun.
damental human rights, but alsoin- |
vite serious abuses of due process and |
the Rule of Law. .

It is most disturbing that Mr
Shipanga, at the taxpayer's expense,
and protected by a statutory immuni-
ty against possible legal action,
repeats unchecked allegations by an
obecure letter writer and then, on the
basis of those slanderous allegations
proceeds to ‘sharply’ criticise a senior
and respected Priest of the order of
the Oblates whose dedication
towards the protection of Christian
values in this territory can hardly be |
questioned. !

Mr Shipanga has chosen Father |
Nordkamp as a target of severe |
criticism. At the same time Mr |
Shipanga however chooses to remain
silent about the Police’s admission
under oath in the Heita trial present-
ly before the Windhoek Supreme
Court, presenting a picture of brutal
violations of the most elementary
human rights and an alarming
disregard for law and order by the
police. : -

In view of the aforesaid, this order
wishes to record its strongest objec: |
tion to Mr Shipanga’s criticiam of |

SEVENTY -five percent of the Herero
people were killed by Germans dur
ing their brutal colonial rule over
Namibia. The Nama people were
reduced to 50 percent. The problem
we have today, which is South
African colonialiam, is built up on the
foundation created and cemented by

German colonialiam. Germany has a

historical responsibility and role to
play in the decolonisation of Namibia
because she opened that colonial door
through which South African col-
onialism entered Namibia.

As a Namibian, a victim of that
German colonialism, I was shocked
to read in the Windhoek Advertiser
of November 21 1986 that the Etango
movement received 30 000 Rand
from West Germany. This was an-
nounced by the socalled chief coor.
dinator of Etango, Mr Andre van der
Kolff.

Etango (like Koevoet which is link:
ed to the police) appears to be part of
the South African Defence Force, and
therefore linked to it. “Donations”
from West Germany mean to every
Namibian: the financing the killing
of Namibians, prolonging the col.
onial rule they started, prolonging
the suffering of Namibians.

We also know that West Germany
supplics SA with military technology
and about 90 percent of the SADF
means of transport is from West Ger-
many. Now it is again ‘‘donations”
and we don’t know what the next will
be.

Soon Namibia will be free and the
independent Namibia will draw up
a list identifying our friends and
those who supported liberation.
Thosé who are financing colonial
forces and their squads, such as
Koevoet and Etango, are already
creating their grounds not to appear
on that list where all freedom and
peace-loving countries in the world
will appear.

Our message to them is: support
the liberation of Namibia and. the
abolition of apartheid in South Africa
and Namibia, instead of reviving the
colonial past which has already
many other historical mistakes and
crimes 10t only against the Nami-
bian people, but against other Euro-
pean countries just 40 years ago.

THE NAMIBIAN of March 27
published an article attempting to
throw suspicion on Christian Ac-
tion asa front for the Defence Force,
because an officer of the SWA Ter-
ritory Force is a member of Chris-
tian Action. This open letter is sub-
mitted for publication toinform in-
terested persons and the public at
large of the true facts of the
controversy.

MS GWEN LISTER:

YOU apparently have serious problems
with any person or event that 1s not 1n &<or-
dance with your figments of the imadina.
tion regarding situations and related events
in our country. You chose to ignore Chris-

tian Action’s request that you submit in
writing your questions about CA to us. In-
stead, your action was to attempt to cast
suspicion on Christian Action in public
Christian Action will therefore follow your
example in using the public media to afford
all interested persons the opportunity to
read what Christian Action stands for as op-
posed to what you stand for. We consequent.
ly challenge you to consider investigating
Christian Action, and to publish your fin.
dings. We, in turn, will definitely not
hesitate tokeepthe publicinformedof CA's
activities,

Ms Lister, you and your accomplices were
requested in no uncertain terms to submit
in writing your queries about Christian Ac-
tion, to ensure that Christian Action if not
victimised by a person's own, possibly incor-
rect, understanding of the true meaning of
comment made by Christian Action.

You however considered yourself too
elevated to correspond with honest people.
You even went to far astotwist the little we
did say. Christian Action’s request that was
that you put your questions in writing so
that we would have aclear understandiny:
of your inquiry, and you would have an ab-
solutely clear understanding of our reply
The material would then have been very
useful to both you and ourselves should a
misunderstanding have arisen. Would such
action not have been more responsible and
professionally journalistic?

You, Ms Lister, really have nothinp
against Christian Action assuch Youhave
a tremendous amount to say about the fact
that Christian Action vehemently objects to
socalled clergymen who are more involved
with politics(and not even objectively)than
with their spiritual tasks It is no secret that
Christian Action identified the fact that cer-
tain socalled clergymen attempt to mislead
their congregation so that anti-christians,
communists and suchlike can force their
own ideology which contradicts the Bible,
on their people. Therefore, all you could do,
Ms Lister, was to attempt to cast suspicion
on the strong point of view made by a
member of Christian Action.

What you did will not work, Ms Lister. You
forget that Co] Radmore is not Christian Ac-
tion. You forget that Col Radmore is a
Qioernliinad Chrietian whondner not hesitate

member of Christian Action.

What you did will not work, Ms Lister. You
forget that Col Radmore is not Christian Ac-
tion. You. forget that Col Radmore is a
disciplined Christian who does not hesitate
to acknowledge his strong belief in and love
for the Lord in public. You fail to appreciate
the fact that Col Radmore is one of the many
who knows what atrocious and senseless
terrorist deeds Swapo and their puppets
commit among the population. You, Ms
Lister, will possibly not be able to unders-
tand why a person like Col Radmore can be
outspoken for the Lord. You are seriously
mistaken, Me Lister, when you think that
through naive mudslinging against a per-
son, youcan cast suspicion on Christian Ac.
tion, amongst fellow Christians. There are
many Christians, Ms Lister, in this lovely
country of ours, who like Col Radmore are
genuine in their belief. Many are members
of the Defence Force, the Police Force, the
private sector, the state, businessmen, even
newsmen and women.

Ms Lister, you gofurther in your attempt
at casting suspicion by insinuating that
Christian Action could possibly be con-
nected with the Department of INforma.
tion. Forget these tactics, they don't work.
Christians have direction. They know what
the Lord expects of them, and they don't
need to be connected with anyone or
anything other than the Lord. We will sup-
port each other, and jointly we Christians,
irrespective of where we are, will fight Satan
in whatever form he may appear. Ms Lister,
you will be astounded to hear how many
members of Christian Action and other
Christians support this viewpoint, and who
differ with you in this respect.

Hundreds of people support Christian Ac-
tion, Ms Lister. Many, many Christians
havecontributed financially and otherwise
to enable Christian Action to reach out to
fellow-Christians to inform them who the
real enemy is, and to tel] how certain

and their puppets misuse the Bi-

ble and the Lord to promote their own idol
in a fashion foreign to our Christian nation.

We believe more people read the newslet-
ter of Christian Action than those reading
your little newspaper. However, you are
more than welcome tocontinue publishing
names of members of Christian Action, and
what Christian Action stands for. We have
nothing to hide. We are proud of the fact that
we can serve the Lord, and that we are not
dependent on the whims and woes of Swapo
politicians and their puppets, interested on-
ly in power and whodon’t hesitate to murder
and maim thousandsof people in their quest
for power.

Christian Action will not cease to keep
fellow Christians informed to what degree
socalled clergymen are involved with
recruitment and incitement of youth to sow
death and destruction as young terrorists,
and of how socalled clergymen are
manipulated by Swapo to proclaim and
often preach, that Swapo is the only
representative of the people of this country.

We will also continue to indicate how
socalled clergymen are involved with inter-
national terrorist groupe to prevent Chris.
tians from serving the Lord. Christian Ac.
tion will also continue giving people like
you, Ms Lister, the opportunity to meet eye
to eye with genuine Christians who per.
sonally experienced how Swapo and their
allies persecuted people who refused to ac-
cept and support an anti-Christian ideology
We will go to extreme efforts to show how
false certain ‘clergymen’ and their imitators
are in their preservation of basic human
rights You, Ms Lister, know that we are
referring among others to the socalled
‘Swapo 100"". You yourself have appealed to
Swapo to give these people a fair trial, and
to advise their next-of-kin and to permit
legal representation for these people. You
Ms Lister, have done this, but noclergyman
has made such an appeal.

There are many more aspects that Chris-
tian Action will convey to you and the in.
habitants of this country. You will be plac-
ed on our mailing list in future. We do,
however, reapect the feelings of every per.
son, and enjorse the Charter of Fundamen.
tal Rights as is expected of true Christians,
and therefore don’t mind if you ignore our
newsletter. You know that the truth often
hurts. Don't fear that Christian Action will
force anybody to accept what we say. We tell
what we know. Christian Action does not in-
timidate. Christian Action does not require
anybody to move from door to door to
threaten people will death ifthey will not ac-
cept what westand for. Christian Action will
not plant mines, or plant bombs in butcher
shope and service stations, or destroy the
homes of innocent people with explosives.
Christian Action will also not call on
clergymen to open their churches to
political parties and socalled freedom
fighters so that they can promote heresy.

No, Ms Lister, we champion peace. We
serve the Lord, and we will continue tofight
and to get politics out of the churches and

NOTE: Unfortunately of the four
signatures ontheletter(with the excep-
tion of those of Col Desmond Radmore
and Mr George Yates) two are in-
decipherable, so the public is as much
in the dark as ever about socalled
‘Christian Action’. Neither did the
lengthy missive serve to shed more light
on this mysterious organisation. It con-
sists primarily of waffling on your part,
Colonel Radmore, and references toor-
dained priests as ‘socalled clergymen’
shows that you yourself are involved in
senseless mud-slinging and politicking
on behalf of certain instances. You may
well serve the Lord, but you serve the
SADF as well, and the First Command-

correspondence of your organisation,
you also claim that you are able to |
monitor the comings and goings of
clergymen at military bases, which
would seem to indicate you convenient

‘Christian Action’ propaganda.

Presumably also, in “fighting to get

Dutch Reformed Church as well as the
Council of Churches groupings. But I
doubt that. Yours is a highly selective
morality.

standard practice followed by
reputable journalists. I have found in
my lengthy journalism career(army in-

people who make these sort of requests
are usually attempting to conceal or

evade the issue.

In conclusion: I have published the

themselves (ifthey are able to figure out)

myself cannot establish who you are
and what you are trying to do, except to
join the chorus of anti-Swapo pro-

Obviously churchleaders are our
guides in the struggle. They are the
ones who can truly solve problems,
especially regarding the “beatings
and torture” by Koevoet in northern

Namibia.

Churchleaders must be involved in
politics because they are true
peacelovers of Namibia who are strug-
gling for peace and freedom; because
they love their people and country, they
must try to defend their people by tell-
ing Koevoet members to stop their
intimidation,

I WOULD like to refer to an announce-
ment in a recent radio programme
stating that churchleaders should not
be involved in politics. Why is this the
case?

Obviously churchleaders are our
guides in the struggle. They are the
ones who can truly solve problems,
especially regarding the “beatings
and torture” by Koevoet in northern

Namibia.

Churchleaders must be involved in
politics because they are true
peacelovers of Namibia who are strug-
gling for peace and freedom; because
they love their people and country, they
must try to defend their people by tell-
ing Koevoet members to stop their
intimidation.

Churchleaders, keep it up! Do not be
intimidated.

TAKE note that the people of Otimb-

noted critically the undesirable
medical care service that your health

However, after almost a month your

siderate towards the rotten medical
service and the lives of the people your
government claims to protect and
govern. To be sure, your department
has not moved even an inch torespond
to the demands of the people. Dr

Minister Kozonguizi’s epistle is
what hecallsa “review” ofour booklet

The booklet attempts to present
Namibians with the facts and by the
proviston of these facts and the
analysts of these facts, to strengthen
the commitment of ali these who call
for immediate impiementation of

We can all agree thata constitution
isone ofthe most important pillars of
a stable democratic state -1f not the
very foundationof it, But surely such
an important basic document must
represent the will of the people of
Namuibra otherwise it will have to be
imposed andthenit will not be worth
the paper on which it is written To
represent the will of the people, it
follows that only truly elected
representatives of the people can

Andtoelect such representatives of
the people who will thendraw upacon
stitution for Namibia. in the exercise
of their self-determination and right
to independence, 1s the very aim and
essence of Resolution 435 of 1978

After the constitution so drawn up by
the elected representatives, there
could be a further election forthe first
government of Namibia in terms ofthe
agreed constitution That willineffect
meanaconstitution before anclection
for a Namibian government

In the case of Namibia. however.
there already exists an international
ayreement.on the inclusion of certain
specified constitutional principles and
fundamental human rights in the
future constitution of Namibia and
also safeguards for the protection of
minorities in the form ofa provision for
proportional representation and for
the further details of the constitution
to be decided upon by at least a two
thirds majority

So itis clear that even here a com-
promise hus already been reached
between those who want a constitution
first and those who want an election
before a constitution

Swapo hasconsistently stood by the
peace plan and the democratic elec:
tions provided for in it, whereas
Minister Kozonguiz:. Minister
Shipanga and others show no sign of
suggesting anv sort of country-wide
elections to legitimise their appoint
ments by the SA Government Have
vou redefined democracy, Minister
Kozonguizi? If 30, please let the ‘in
telligent” readers have vour definition
and your government's planof action

internationally recognised
independence.

If vour vague allegations ayainst
Swapo ure trut, you should welcome
elections in termsof Resolution 435 of
1978 because then vou can attack and
denigrate Swapo in their presence in

peace plan provides for the return of al!
refugees and one can imayine the

seem to be three (1) capitulation » by

may bow to fate by accepting the South
African settlers and abiding bv the dic

negotiation - tn the hope that the SA
Government may modify its position
which would amount to capitulation:
(Srindifference inthe hope thatother
countries, other powers, may take up
their struggle and attain freedom for
them. None of these, especially the first,
seems very likely

The fourth 1s armed struggle
whichis alwayseasier todiscuss than
toplan, easertoorganise than to carry
out, for it must be pursued with
ruthless determination to win and
it must be reinforced by a principl-
ed dedication to the cause. From
thier public pronouncements, iLseems
clear that the leaders of South West
Africa are moving in the direction of
armed struggle”

ft appears that the Honourable
Minister has since 1966 accepted the
firstoption above viz “Capitulation. ”

What basis do Namibians have for
beheving that the interim government
willabide by whatever constitution it
might draw up, when itis responsible
tonoclectorate having never faced an
election?

Excuse of UN Partiality: We
acknowledge tn our booklet the fact of
UN partiality, but we explain whys it
will not have any effect on the judge
ment of Namibians ina 445 election
But why don't you acknowledge South
Africa’s partiality? Why not?

The Honourable Minister of Justice
has often inthe past reiterated thatin
Africa power comes from the barrel ot
agun, and we suspect that he and some
of his associates have accepted this
credo.

It seems futile to argue with the
Minister about free and fair elections
Ifinterested in elections at all.it will
have to be elections which he can be
guaranteed to win- and free and fair
elections are unlikely to lead to that
result

Reply to Kozo

WE HAVE read, with interest, a letter
received from Minister Kozonguizi
typed on a letterhead of the Depart.
ment of Information, indicated that
even such letters are done at the tax-
payer's expense.

Minister Kozonguizi's epistle is
what hecalisa “review” of our booklet
- “The Choice - Namibia Peace Plan
435 or Society under Siege”.

The booklet attempts to present
Namibians with the facta and by the
provision of these facts and the
analysis of these facts, to strengthen
the commitment of all those who call
for immediate implementation of
Resolution 435 of 1978.

It constitutes analysis as wellasad-
vocacy. It stands however in stark con-
trast tothe type of advocacy and distor.
tion of facts by the Honourable
Minister and al! thoee institutions,
parties, groups, persons and
mouthpieces with whom the
Honourable Minister, his government
and the South African Government, is
closely associated.

It presents the truth in rebuttal of
the propaganda daily poured out for
Mr Kozonguizi’s cause and financed by
millions, if not billions of Rand from
the pockets of the South African and
Namibia taxpayers, and in the case of
Namibia - without the consent of the
taxpayers and without the consent of
Namibians.

If ever there was denigration
without facts and without reason, you
see it inthe Minister’s letter which is
typical of the mass of propaganda com.
ing from that source.

According to the learned advocate
who has never practiced in this coun-
try, advocacy is unethical or un-
professional conduct for an advocate.
Does he not know that lawyers, ad-
vocates and judges do not only
analyse facts, but also come to con-
clusions, make submissiona and
reach judgements on the facts.

Why aconstitution before anelec-
tion? This matter is dealt with ade-

quately in our booklet and readers are
referred to it.

We can all agree that aconstitution
is one of the most important pillars of
a stable democratic state - if not the
very foundation of it. But surely such
an important basic document must
represent the will of the people of
Namibia otherwise it will have to be
imposed and then it will not be worth
the paper on which it is written. To
represent the will of the people, it
follows that only truly elected
representatives of the people can
represent the will of the people.

And toelect such representatives of
the people who will then draw upacon-
stitution for Namibia, in the exercise
of their self-determination and right
to independence, is the very aim and
essence of Resolution 435 of 1978.

After the constitution so drawn up by
the elected representatives, there
could be a further election for the first
government of Namibia in termsofthe
agreed constitution. That will in effect
mean aconstitution before anelection
for a Namibian government.

In the case of Namibia, however,
there already exists an international
agreement, on the inclusion of certain
specified constitutional principles and
fundamental human rights in the
future constitution of Namibia and
also safeguards for the protection of
minorities in the form of a provision for
proportional representation and for
the further details of the constitution
to be decided upon by at least a two-
thirds majority.

So it is clear that even here a com-
promise has already been reached
between those who want a constitution
first and those who want an election
before a constitution.

Swapo has consistently stood by the
peace plan and the democratic elec-
tions provided for in it, whereas
Minister Kozonguizi, Minister
Shipanga and others show no sign of
suggesting any sort of country-wide
elections to legitimise their appoint-
ments by the SA Government. Have
you redefined democracy, Minister
Kozonguirzi? If so, please let the “‘in-
telligent”’ readers have your definition
and your government's plan of action
for democracy, self-determination and
internationally recognised
independence.

If your vague allegations against
Swapo are trut, you should welcome
elections in terms of Resolution 435 of
1978 because then you can attack and
denigrate Swapo in their presence in
front of the Namibian people. The
peace plan provides for the return of all
refugees and one can imagine the
many witnesses then becoming
available to substantiate these
charges, iftrue. Why miss such anex-
cellent opportunity to free the tortured
refugees and confront Swapo face to
face? The Namibian people can then be
the judges. When the Honourable
Minister denigrates Swapo, he should
remember that he himself set out the
options for Namibian resistance after
the 1966 World Court decision on
Namibia, when in an article in African
Forum, he declared: ‘In fact, the deci-
sion of the International Court of
Justice has had one positive result: It
has underlined, for the people of South
West Africa, thata direct confrontation
with the Government of South Africa
may be inevitable Unless the South
West Africans are prepared to work
from within, to rely primarily upon
themselves, to mobilise their own
physical and moral resources, it is dif.
ficult to see how, in the forseeable future,
South Africa can be uprooted from its
entrenched position within the Ter.
ritory. Since experience has taught
Africans that external intervention in
a struggle for liberation has never pro-
ved decision against an organised in-
ternal force ltke that of South Africa,
final victory in South West Africa can
be guaranteed only by a disciplined
resistance movement, abovue-or
underground, within the country
self""

“Hf this ts the case, then the choices
before the people of South West Africa,

whether political or military, are only
four: In the political realm the choices
seem to be three: (1) capitulation - by
which I mean that South West Africa
may bow to fate by accepting the South
African settlers and abiding by the dic
tates of the Pretoria government; (2)
negotiation - tn the hope that the SA
Government may modify tts position -
which would amount to capitulation,
(3) indifference - in the hope that other
countries, other powers, may take up
their struggle and attain freedom for
them. None of these, especially the first,
seems very likely.

The fourth is armed struggle -
which is always easier to discuss than
to plan, easier to organise than tocarry
out, for tt must be pursued with
ruthless determination to win and
it must be reinforced by a princip}-
ed dedication to the cause. From
thier public pronouncements, it seems
clear that the leaders of South West
Africa are moving in the direction of
armed struggle”.

It appears that the Honourable
Minister has since 1966 accepted the
first option above viz. “Capitulation...”

What basis do Namibians have for
believing that the interim government
willabide by whatever constitution it
might draw up, when it is responsible
tonoelectorate having never facedan
election?

Excuse of UN Partiality: We
acknowledge in our booklet the fact of
UN partiality, but we explain why it
will not have any effect on the judge-
ment of Namibians in a 435 election.
But why don't you acknowledge South
Africa’s partiality? Why not?

The Honourable Minister of Justice
has often inthe past reiterated that in
Africa power comes from the barrel of
agun, and we suspect that he and some
of his associates have accepted this
credo.

It seems futile to argue with the
Minister about free and fair elections.
If interested in elections at all, it will
have to be elections which he can be
guaranteed to win - and free and fair
elections are unlikely to lead to that
result.

Negotiation and Reconciliation
before Independence: There is
nothing wrong with this aim in prin-
ciple. But this aim must be bona fide
and the opportunities for negotiation
and reconciliation not abused as hap-
pened in 1961 in Geneva and 1984 in
Lusaka.

Itis not a requirement of of the peace
plan for Swapo to “sign a ceasefire
document with South Africa” even
though it may be useful if they do. All
that is required is that both SA and
Swapo indicate their willingness toim-
plement a ceasefire So the alleged
disadvantage to ani-Swapo parties in
that Swapo will gain ‘prestige’ by
signing a ceasefire document withSA,
does not exist.

Minister Kozonguizt’s government's
existence isin breach of its own socall-
ed BillofFundamental Rightsinthat
the said Bill provides that a govern.
ment derives its power and capacities
from the consent of the people Such
consent it never obtained and Minister
Kozonguizi also shows no intention to
face the electorate.

In conclusion we note that Minister
Kozonguizi has, despite his long
treatise, not told us whether his
government wants to stop the war
and if so how it will achieve this, in
view of the fact that it has no con.
trol over defence, security and
foreign affairs.

We undertake to be constructive and
even handed. We will the Minister and
his colleagues will in future do the
same. We can begin with a televised
debate on the issue ifthe Honourable
Minister can arrange this with the
Government's television station in
Namibia.

I WISH to air my disappointment
about the issue of permits to the
travelling public between Rundu and
the Caprivi.

Fellow Namibians, it hurts tosee the
travelling public suffering likethey do
inthe country of their birth. Ever since
the introduction of the issue of permits
by the SADF eight years ago, it seems
that Namibians are not much concern-
ed about it.

The permits in question is not a
statutory law ofthecountry butrather
an imaginary law introduced by the ar-
my to cause severe hardship to Capri-
vians and the travelling public.

The army should immediately and
unconditionally do away with the issue
of permits, for if not, Namibians will
be left with nooption than tochallenge
the validity of the permits in acourt of
law. Members of the travelling public
are checked and their clothing left in
the dust road, after every 50km stretch
from Bagani to Kongola.

A poor Caprivian motorist with his
family, was travelling from Katima
Mulilo to Windhoek and at the
Kongola army checkpoint was ordered
todrive 120km back to Katima to have
his provision of fish written on the
socalled permit. He had torefill hiscar
with petrol for a second time although
the permit in question does not
stipulate the inclusion of provisions of
any kind. Though you are in possession
of the permit, it does not offer you pro-
tection of any kind, because it is
stipulated that youtravel at yourown
risk. What is the use of carrying
something that does not give you any
protection? What is the use of iden-
tification cards issued to Namibians
and residents? The behaviour of Up-
ingtonians and people trom the Cape
is intolerable and they must be sent
back to where they came from.

I appeal to all peaceloving church
organisations, progressive political
parties, and Namibiansboth and
white, to stand up and apeak out
against the issue of permits between
Rundu and Caprivi. .

KILLING won't help Namibians,
especially those Swapol members in
Windhoek.

It is our plea for those peace-loving
Namibians to try and look at the
political struggle with some common
sense.

Many people, especially members of
Swapol, also known as Koevoet, seem
to believe that physical violence will
change our views as Namibians in this
country.

I and two comrades, living in the
Katutura compound, were assaulted
by drunk membersof Swapol on April
15(a Wednesday) after midnight at the
Rasta Funk Disco.

Why do members of these forces at-
tack innocent Namibians? Were they
appointed to maintain law and order
or not?

Are they trained in the right way? Or
are they trained to hit and kick inno-
cent people? Shouldn't they be helping
us against trespassers of the law?

It seems that many of those people
are cowardly rather than brave, and
this is why they attack innocent
civilians rather than delinquents.

Whatever they do, apartheid will one
day be abolished and the racist, apar-
theid followers in our country, should

On anti-Swapo

ON JUNE 9, I received anonymous
anti-Swapo literature. I have learned
that the literature has ‘»een circulated
tomany people who are suspected ofbe-
ing members of Swapo in the Kavango.

What surprised me is that this
literature is the act of a coward, since
the documentation is not attributed or
named. The literature is full of mixed
texts extracted from various unknown
newspapers accompanied by a poor
Rukwangali version. It is also full of
anti-Nujoma statements such as ‘Nu-
joma het geslaan’, and ‘Vuishou 'n
akok’, to mention but a few.

Some Swapo executives in Kavango
were warned about what they were do-
ing. There is also a page of pictures of
eight people, probably emanating from
the socalled Parents Committee, with
question marks. These eight people
are those they believe have been ex-
semted by the movement.

According to news reports around
25 000 people are benefiting from an
emergency feeding scheme. The
Department of National Health and
Welfare, and private welfare organiza-
tions, like the Red Crogs are involved.
While having sympathy with
hungry people, and supporting the ef:
forts to help, we have to ask ourselves,
“Why are these people starving”. The
following problems are contributing to
the problem viz:
A) Population Growth:
The annual population growth hovers
around three percent. Fifty percentof
the population is 15 years or younger,
and therefore unproductive. Between
© to 10 percent are retired and no
longer make a contribution. Present-
ly only 20 percent ofthe population are
gainfully economically employed, and
of this group, one quarter works for the
State. The balance 20-25% are either
subsistence farmers or unemployed.
The population growth ou tstrips
food production, housing resources,
schooling, Health services and job crea-
tion. As @ result the population
becomes poorer and poorer, and the
economically active group smaller in
proportion. It is always tempting in an
effort toredistribute wealth, to heavi-
ly tax this group. Care must however
be taken not tokill the goose that lays
the golden eggs.
B) Drought:
Namibia isasemi-desert country and
droughts are part of life. The problem
arises when the odd few good rainfal]
years are taken asthe norm and no pro-
vision is made for the inevitable bad
years in nature's cycle.
C) Farming Methods:
Farming methodsaresometimes very
destructive, especially in the com-
munal areas. There, no rotation graz-
ing is implemented and very little con-
trol is exercised over stock numbers.
Traditionally the number of cattle iB
a symbol of wealth, irrespective of their
condition. Owners are alsooften loathe
to sell their cattle, even in times of
drought, with resultant destruction of
grazing and death, as witnessed a few
years ago in Kaokoveld. The result ig
the same as in the Sahel region in
North Africa. Man has totally upset
the delicate balance of nature for short
term gain, with longterm destructive
results, |

D) Guerrilla War: | |

BVO US SO

-D) Guerrilla War:

The war, especially in Owambo, con-
tributes tothe misery ofthe locals. As
-aresult ofthe political uncertainty and
‘lack of international recognition, in-
vestments are not readily made in
‘Namibia, with resultant meagre job
creation. The spill-over of the war in
Angola, streches our limited resources
with refugees.

E) Good Medica! Services:

As a result of good medical services
more people survive in an otherwise
often hostile environment. There isa
sense of fatalism and the beliefthat the
State will provide for all needs. This 1s
often demanded as a right which the
State has to satisfy. Unfortunately this
demand is not matched by responsibil.
ty or contribution. In order to try and
solve the problem, and to avoid an
ecological and biological disaster, the
problem must be tackled with political
will.

A) Population Planning:

Namibia isnyt arichcountry. Many of
its resources are transient cy.
diamonds(CDM), base minerals(TC1.),
uranium (Rossing), gas(KUDU), and
gold(Karibib). When the mines close,
this source of income is gone. The
resources remaining will be farming,
fishing, tourism and human. If the
human resource is planned and nur.

tured it will be the most important.

One Just has to look at Japan, a coun-
try with virtually no natura!
resources, but an incredible human
resource.

Due to the population explosion,
China has taken drastic steps aiming
at one child per family. Parents who
want more will have to pay and forfeit
free services and free schooling. This
may sound very radical but one hasto
he cruel to be kind. The alternative is
another Ethiopia. Here the initial
worldwide enthusiasm and Bob
eldoft waned as 400n as the TV im.
ages faded and aid mismanay
became known gement

Population planning can also not be
seen in the white/black political con-
text. Already blacks outnumber
whites by more than twelve to one.
Whether it is two to one or 12 to one
makes no difference in aone-manone-

~
*
vote election. Therefore population
planning as a form of imperialistic,
capitalistic, racial suppression, has no
logical or scientific basis.

With the present growth curve,
demands on health, housing, food,
education andemployment, are in ex:
cess of supply, and the situation is
worsening. Demand greater than
supply boosts inflation, whichinturn
aggravates poverty even further. It is
a vicious cycle. Only a firm political
statement of intent and action, can
break this cycle. It will require a brave
man to doit, but if successfull, he will
go down in history as the man who
brought progress and prosperity. Peo-
ple will become independent of, rather
than dependent on the State.

B) Farming Methods:

Farming methods must become scien-
tificand conservative. Namibia is vir-
tually only suited to livestock and
game farming. The delicate ecological
symbiosis must be nurtured for future
generations.

C) Political Settlement

’ (AG8 and Resolution 435):

The guerrilla war can only be ter-
minated by a political settlement. It is
often said that Namibia must decide
its own future, but to most who have
followed the political yo-yo game, it is
obvious that outside sources from a
number of sides are manipulating our
future. A settlement will hopefully
bring peace, stability, investment and
prosperity.

D) Good Medical Services:

Good medical services must gohandin |
hand with education and economic ©
progress.

E) Political Independence:

Political independence depends on
economic independence. Namibia’s
resources must be developed by Nami-
bians for Namibia, with help if
necessary. Presently symptoms and
not causes are treated. This only
postpones a solution until it becomes
insurmountable.

Man has been able to control all
other formsofliebut not himself. One
of the few people still inharmony with
nature is the Kalahari bushman. He
sets anexcellentexampleofliveand let
live, unlike the suicidal lemmings of
the Antarctic.

You don't help a poor man by giving
him a fish, but by showing him how to
catch a fish. The aim should be in-
dependence not hand-out nurtured
dependence.

a vicious cycle. Only a firm political
statement of intent and action, can
break this cycle. It will require a brave
man to doit, but if successfull, he will
go down in history as the man who
brought progress and prosperity. Peo-
ple will become independent of, rather
than dependent on the State.

B) Farming Methods:
Farming methods must become scien-
tificand conservative. Namibia is vir-
tually only suited to livestock and
game farming. The delicate ecological
symbiosis must be nurtured for future
generations.
C) Political Settlement
' (AG8 and Resolution 435):
. The guerrilla war can only be ter-
minated by a political settlement. Itis
often said that Namibia must decide
its own future, but to most who have
followed the political yo-yo game, it is
obvious that outside sources from a
number of sides are manipulating our
future. A settlement will hopefully
bring peace, stability, investment and
prosperity. |
D) Good Medical Services:
Good medical services must go hand in
hand with education and economic
progress.
E) Political Independence:
Political independence depends on
economic independence. Namibia’s
resources must be developed by Nami-
bians for Namibia, with help if
necessary. Presently symptoms and
not causes are treated. This only
postpones a solution until it becomes
insurmountable.

Man has been able to control all
other formsofliebut not himself. One
_ of the few people still inharmony with
nature is the Kalahari bushman. He

live, unlike the suicidal lemmings of
the Antarctic.

You don't help a poor man by giving
him a fish, but by showing him how to
catch a fish. The aim should be in-
dependence not hand-out nurtured
dependence.

cerning the recent visit of high-

Ministers to Namibia. One wonders
why they do this because it has no
meaning for Namibians. Isit possible
that South Africa’s Defence Minister

ALLOW ME to respond to the letter
published in The Namibia of July 10,
entitled ‘Coward Lister.

First I would like to inform Mr
Mungunda and his Union that Lister
| ig a fair and honest editor. The weekly
paper, The Namibian, 1s presenting
the true facts of what is happening in
thiscountry. The Namibian is the on-
ly real newspaper in Namibia which
prints the truth about the country.

Lister did not berate and insult the
| HYereros as you alleged. The paper
revealed to the public the ungodly
| work of the Nudo members Itis self-
evident that Nudo members and their
‘bishops’ are South African proxies,
who are used by the colonial govern
ment to disrupt meetings af pro-
gressive forces and character:
aysassinate Swapo members and
supPOrle;rs.

Donot misjudge Lister or accuse her
falsely. We the public know of your dir-
ty tricks.

Worst of all, you claimed that your
Union (Namibian Churches Union)is
a ‘truly Christian body’ Your letter
had nice terminology but lacked reah-
ty and is confronted with countless
dilemmas. a
Your letter covered the true core
nature of the Union and ameared the

true Christian churchea and peace-

loving poople by depicting them as
cr

comic characters of political puppet
shows. Mr Mungunda, you failed to
check your facts before you picked up
a pen,

Yo can't call your Union a ‘truly
Christian body’ when it stated that
“we have no political prisoners, no
state of emergency. We have the right
of assembly and freedom of speech’

Against thisbackground your Union
proved itself anti-Christian and
anti-humaneneas.

Today we live under the ungodly
system of apartheid, which is devour.
ing the Namibian children, but your
‘truly Christian body’ stated that
‘human rights are being carried out
through the government on the basis
ofour BillofRights’” Onthecontrary,
on July 5, Swapo supporters were
beaten upon their way toa Swaporal-
ly and an eight-year-old gir) allegedly
beaten by police. Is this what your
Union refer to as ‘freedom of speech
and the right of assembly’.

In the north our people live under the
agony of horror and death. Church pro-
pertios are destroyed daily Isthishow
human rights are guaranteed by the
BillofRights? Here again your Union
provedclearly tobe the mouthpiece of
the interim government. All the socall-
ed ‘bishops’ appear to be DTA
members.

The ‘truly Christian body’ also
KLated that Swapo is not banned, but
today Swapo supporters and “sym.
pathisers ure the victims of Koevoet,
police and Nude vigilantes, who are in
the pay of the colonial government.
Then again you stated that Swapo
should not hire political priests to
negotiate surrender,

Swapo is a Namibian liberation
movement formed by the oppressed —
Namibians as a result of colonial.
racist, draconian laws imposed on
them.

Swapo is the uppressed people and
the oppressed people are Swapo And
the CCN Bishops are part and parce|
of the oppressed Namibians. They are
commilted Christians who are Dro.
Claiming the true Rospel of peace and
justice. They are not money
mongerers They are doing their dut \
as Christians ina society which is torn

by the evil of apurtheid and colonial
oppression.
Then vour Chiech Tle... so
‘Then your Church Union called on
the international cummunity to in-
fluence Swapo to free the socalled
prisoners kept ‘in holesinthe ground
by Swapoin Angola’ It may be true, but
why do you also not appeal to South
Africa to release allthe prisonersheld
under Proclamations AG 9 and 26? In
the north civilians are dying at the
hands of Koevoet and others, Where
are you in this regard?

Dear priests of NCU, don't turn a ho-
ly church intoa business game. Don't
mislead your Christian congregations
The time hag come for you to join the
real struggle

Lastly, Mungunda pointed out that
Swapo should surrender, | wish to
point out to him that the Namibian
struggle is a just struggle, precipitated
by South Africancolonial oppression.
Resistance will be there as long asthe
Namibian people are oppressed and ex.
ploited. We will continue to resist un.
Lil SA comes to its senses and meets our
demands. :

I think your statements would be
more wisely directed to the colonial
power and its unelected MPC wovern-
ment to relinquish their window.

Please allow me tosay something in
the newspaper which does not conceal
the truth.

On 22-7-1987, the chairman of a
parliamentary group in London, Mr
Nicolas Winterton, spoke over the col-
onial Radio Owambo, and expressed
dissatisfaction with the bomb explo-
sion in Windhoek a few weeks ago. He
said that the Swapo office in London
should be closed down because that
organization did a bad thing by plan-
ting the bomb.

Mr Winterton I want to know
whether you have certainty that the
bomb was in fact planted by Swapo.
Real proof is what I need.

Mr Winterton, you say that you are
are feeling bad about the bomb in
which no one lost their lives, and
already you want the office of
Namibia's true freedom fighters tobe
closed down. A real pity.

In the meanwhile you ignore the
despicable misdeeds which are being
committed by South Africa. For exam-
ple, Mrs Alina Shilongo’s house which
was destroyed by South Africa’s
Casspirs on 3-7-1987. That was the
house of an aged woman of 80 years.
Should it have been your grandmoyner,
what would you say?. Give an an4ver —
to that. Of course you are not feeling |
any disquiet because her skin is
black.

Winterton, neither you nor South
Africa's apartheid is wanted here in
Namibia.

You must be happy about what your
friend, South Africa, has done by
shooting and killing an innocent
schoolgirl.(Laina Trapopi, 8-7-1987).

And now you are saying that Swapo
has committed a misdeed, and its of-
fices in London should be closed.

In that case, would you ask that
South Africa’s ‘offices’ be closed down
in Namibia? Should they close because
of what is happening here? Or is your
boss South Africa doing good in
Namibia?

Winterton, when you say that you

Winterton, when you say that you
feel pity about Swapo because It does
not enjoy majority support from us
Namibians, you are lying completely.
We Namibians have a high regard for
Swapo as the organization which ts
challenging South Africa, and which
wants Resolution 435 to be im.

South Africa from Namibia.

We want true independence, and not —
the many little groups which are being
founded by Dirk Mudge and South
Africa, and which are there only tofur-
ther colonize the Namibians.

Mr Andreas Shipanga, look how the
northern part of Namibia is being
made to suffer by South Africa for
whom you are working. How do you feel
when youand Dirk Mudge, travelling
ina Mercedes Benz going to Owambo,
at the Oshivelo gate you are required
to show your ‘kop-kaart’ because you
might be a terrorist? Is that the in-
dependence you wunt or is there any
apartheid that you and Mr Moses Kat-
jJioungua have removed?
’ Put Resolution 435 into operation
because we do not want colonization
and Dirk Mudge. Also we do not want
Shipanga and Katjioungua's talks. We
want the true leaders of this beloved
country. Mr P W Botha: take away your
destructive forces and leave Namibia,
we dont need you. We want peace and
equality for all and no discrimination.

WE, the participants in a fast for the
SA DF to be withdrawn from Namibia,
send warm greetings toall Namibians.

Our fast has been part of the End
Conscription Campaigns Apartheid
Out - SADF Out campaign. The fast
began on August 3 and ended on
Namibia Day, August 26. Some of us
have fasted for one day of this period,
others for longer and some for the en-
tire three and a half weeks.
We have been praying for the SADF
to leave your country because we are
deeply concerned about the repressive
role it is playing there. Some of us have
visited Namibia and seen for
ourselves, others of us have had the op-
portunity of meeting some of you and
hearing about your own experiences.

We have been praying and fasting
because we have wanted to show our
care, concern and support for you,
Namibians, in aconcrete and practical
way.

[) To the South African Government,
whose forces are illegally occupying
your country, we say, hear the cry of the
majority of Namibians. Show your
sincerity in wanting anend tothe war
and establishing a truly just peace by
lifting the curfew, withdrawing the oc-
cupying SADF forces and moving
towards a swift implementation of
Resolution 435. We all know thut this
is what will end this wasteful and un-
necessary war andthat thisisthe solu.
tion which most Namibians want, so
why are we waiting?
(0'lo you, Namibians, we say, we share
your longings and frustrations and
commit ourselves to continue to pray,
fast and work until the SADF is
withdrawn from your country and un-
ti] your inalienable right tobe free has

been achieved.

WE, the participants in a fast for the
SA DF to be withdrawn from Namibia,
send warm greetings toall Namibians.
| Our fast has been part of the End

Conscription Campaign's Apartheid
Out -SADF Out campaign. The fast
began on August 3 and ended on —
Namibia Day, August 26. Some of us
have fasted for one day of this period,
| others for longer and some for the en-
tire three and a half weeks.
We have been praying for the SADF
to leave your country because we are
deeply concerned about the ive
role it is playing there. Some of us have
visited Namibia and seen for
ourselves, others of us have had the op-
portunity of meeting some of you and
hearing about your own experiences.

We have been praying and fasting
because we have wanted to show our
care, concern and support for you,
Namibians, in aconcrete and practical

way.
(J To the South African Government,
whose forces are illegally occupying
your country, we say, hear the cry of the
majority of Namibians. Show your
sincerity in wanting anend tothe war
and establishing a truly just peace by
lifting the curfew, withdrawing the oc-
cupying SADF forces and moving
towards a swift implementation of
Resolution 435. We all know that this
ig what will end this wasteful and un-
necessary war and that this isthe solu-
tion which most Namibians want, so
why are we waiting?
Clo you, Namibians, we say, we share
your longings and frustrations and
commit ourselves to continue to pray,
fast and work until the SADF is
withdrawn from your country and un-
til your inalienable right to be free has
been achieved.

| LAM a: member of Swanu and I wag
- shigeked when Comrade Sama Nujoma
said ina recent interview published in
The Namibian that Swapo wouldallow
whites to keep their farmsin Namibia
and that they would use only some
uninhabited parts of Namibia for
cooperative projects. Are we tostick to
the Namib Desert and Khomas
Hochland with our ‘cooperative’ pro-
jects a la socialism? Not at all.

The grand children of Maharero,
Mandume and Witbooi are still wag-
ing the war against the racist South
African Government to regain their
land. There must be noquestion about
it. Our forebears gave their lives in
defence of our land and the present
generation is also sacrificing their
lives to regain the land from the white
oppressors. As long as our land re-
mains in the hands of the present
white monopoly farmers, there can be
and there will be no peace and stabili-
ty in Namibia.

The questionofland isa very serious
matter which lies at the heart of our
struggle. The whites will continue to
control our economy ifthey retain the
land and our freedom will be in name
only ... something like the MPC is
claiming today. That will be a sham
freedom within poverty, white domina-
tion and exploitation of our wealth.
Such independence is definitely not
worth fighting for.

We must fight for the land and all our
natural resources. I believe that thisis
the only solution for the black majori-
ty of Namibians. The whites are still
controlling thefarms and the economy
in Zimbabwe and those who fought
during the war are not satisfied at pre-
sent. The Zimbabwean government is
trying to solve this problem which |
realise is a very difficult task at this
stage. This is why in the case of
Namibia we must grab our in-
dependence in terms ofthe ownership
of land. We must show to have learned
the lessonsof African history. The land
belongs tothe people of Africa and not
to those who call themselves ‘Euro-
peans’ in Namibia.

We cannot promise our sacred land
to the very same white farmers who
support the all-apartheid white Na-
tional Party of settlers in Namibia. We
cannot give our land to those who, in
the May 6 elections this year, return-
ed P W Botha to powerinordertopro-
tect their minority rights in Namibia.
We cannot give our land to white
farmers who train Koevoet and who
are themselves commando members
in the South African army.

Since whites do not compromise on
any issue so far, why should we com-
promise our birthright? The masses of
our people shall take over the land
from the white monopoly capitalists
with or without compensation.

upon the SADF to withdraw from the
region, in particular the Ovambo Ad.
ministration and many other victims
of the racist Pretoria regime.

an extension and intensification of up.
Ppreesion and victimisation as is the

Kwautima genuinely wants freedom
and security then he should fight for
the implementation of Resolution 435.

Itseems thatthe menin question do
not know what Resolution 435 is. They
simply believe that Koevoet will bring
stability in the region.

If Kwautima, Nghihulifwa and their
followers cannot exist without the ar-
my and Koevoet, then they should go
together with them, and leave Nami-
brans in peace.

Kwautima claimed over Radio
Owambo that even Chief Mandume
had soldiers. This may be, but Man-
dume did not fight his fellow Nami-
bians but fought the same colonialism
which we Namibians are fighting
against today. How can Kwautima
compare himself with a man like
Mandume?

Whatever Kwautima does. he and

you must not be intimidated by these

attitude of resistance tothe SADF We

Proud of police

1 WAS so confident that you and Ihave
a to be honest andseriousinour
relationship with each other. I had no
reason to doubt your intentions tocom-
municate with me in a mature man-
ner. I however intend to keep to our
bargain and refrain from being per-
sonal and cynical.

1. You can stop being presumptuous.
My promotion had nothing what-
goever to do with our relationship or
with my correspondence with The
Namibian.

9 lamnotthe Security Police, but lam
proud to be a member of that Branch.
3 You will be surprised to learn that
my colleagues and I have had an avid
interest in the compound system for
more than 12 years. We have been
deliberating and negotiating with
numerous instances and governments
to abolish this system. The main
reasons, amongst others, where toen-
sure that those people who worked and
lived far from their home and their
families shouldbe given the chance to
live in peace and tranquility and
should not be controlled by Swapo’s
henchmen through intimidation and
victimisation. Secondly, we were con-
vinced that the majority of those
workers were honest people who
desired to be employed and to earn
enough money to support their
families, but that they inevitably
became, directly or indirectly, involv-
ed in the conflict between criminals
and the police.

4. If you or anybody else is seriously in-
terested to find out what if means to
live ina compound, I will be glad toar-

7. The most important aspect which
you and other people wantonly forget
when criticising the government is
that thousandsof people are involved.
My colleagues in the SWA Police are
aware of the plight of those who lived
in compounds. That is why we did not
criticise or protest in public, but we
_became actively involved in finding a
solution. A solution not to our own pro-
blems, but a solution for those honest
and law-abiding citizens who could not
escape being intimidated by terrorists
and victimised by criminals while liv-
inginacompound. -

8. In the last edition of The Namibian
you reported extensively of the com-
plaints of two men who voluntarily
bought houses. You will be unjuat to
your readers if you do not interview one
or more of those hundreds of men who
are overjoyed with the opportunity to
have their own homes which they can
afford and in which they can stay with
their families without any in-
terference. You will] not regret a visit
to Hakahana and you willexperience
something beautiful inthe joy of those
workers who are united with their
families.

I am proud to have made a concrete
contribution, no matter how small it
was, to the destruction ofthe Katutura
compound and to allow my coun-
trymen to otcupy an own home
together with their families. I know
that these menand their families will
eventually have the peace they desired
andthatthey will graspthe opportunt-
ty tocontribute to mutual respect and
understanding 1n our country.

I have never before experienced so
much affirmation for my beliefs as on
Friday afternoon when thousands of
my fellow countrymen witnessed the
destruction of the compound with joy
and satisfaction. The small
demonstration by insecure people who
were deserted by the organisers,
helped toemphasise the majority ofthe
people who want positive changes
which contribute toa stable future for
our country and its people.

relationship with each other. [hadno
reason to doubt your intentions tocom-
municate with me in a mature man-
ner. 1 however intend to keep to our
bargain and refrain from being per-
sonal and cynical.

soever to do with our relationship or
with my correspondence with The

proud to be a member of that Branch.
3 You will be surprised to learn that
my colleagues and I have had an avid
interest in the compound system for
more than 12 years. We have been
deliberating and negotiating with
numerous instances and governments
to abolish this system. The main
reasons, amongst others, where toen-
sure that those people who worked and
lived far from their home and their
familiesshould be given the chance to
live in peace and tranquility and
should not be controlled by Swapo's
henchmen through intimidation and
victimisation. Secondly, we were con-
vinced that the majority of those
workers were honest people who
desired to be employed and to earn
enough money to support their
families, but that they inevitably
became, directly or indirectly, involv-
ed in the conflict between criminals
and the poliee.

4. If you or anybody else is seriously in-
terested to find out what if means to
liveina compound, I will be glad toar-
range a meeting with people who knew
the situation and whocan inform you
of the truth. I will ensure that you will
not be lied to or mialead by people who

building up the military in our coun:

the socalled SWATF to fight against
their brothers and sisters. The SADF
uses our country asa springboard for
attacks on our neighbouring states. IN
northern Namibia the SADF and
Koevoet units are committing
atrocities against innocent civilians in
Various Ways.

The Botha regime are not ready to
sign a ceasefire with Swapo to bring
about peace, democracy and economic
stability in southern Africa. The
Botha government also wants to top-
ple the MPLA in Angola and install
the Unita puppets, as they have done
in Namibia.

Inhuman and draconian laws have
been forced on the people of this coun-
try; particularly the oppressed black
mapority: I refer to the curfew regula.
tions in northern Namibia; the check-
point at Oshivello where blacks are il].
treated by the notorious Koevoet:
refusal of passports to progressive
leaders; Proclamations AG 26, 9 and
Section 6 of the Terrorism Act interms
of which police have Virtually
unlimited powers.
The SA government is also engaged
in the indoctrination of Namibians:
organisations like Etango, Ezuva,
Namwi Foundation and Ichtus are
there to mislead, confuse and distort
the truth of the liberation struggle.
Etango, the socalled religiouscultural
group rules with the Bible andthe gufn.
Has no-one told these organisations
that Namibians are not communists:
they are oppressed instead by those
who brought the Word of God to Africa.
The oppressors also infiltrate black
schools by means of involvement in
sport, and cadets.

Recently, two makaku nyas from 101
and 202 Battalions respectively, spoke
of discrimination within the socalled
SWATF; said they were forced to fight
on the side of Unita in Angolan ter-
ritory; and resignations have started
because they are not ready to fight
their brothers who want to liberate the
country from the Botha regime. It isa
lesson for us to reject and condemn con-
scription and instead call for the
withdrawal of the SADF from Nami-
bian territory.

The recent invasion of the SADF in.
to Angola: the SADF isthe obstacle to
peace in southern Africa. They are
destabilising the Angolan economy,
and both the SADF and Reagan Ad-
ministration supply the Unita bandits
with Stinger missiles, sophisticated
armaments. The aggressor should stop
fighting for Unita and instead
withdraw its troops from Angolan soil
and go home.
A Resolution was adoptedinthe UN
callingontheSADF’s withdrawal from
Angola. The SA representative
responded that they would not
withdraw unless foreign troops were
withdrawn from Angola. This is unac-
ceptable and stubborn because the
MPLA Government has never
declared war against South Africa;
Fapla troops have never attacked or oc-
cupied SA territory; Angola is a
sovereign country which hastheright
to choose its own friends. |

Namibiansshould unite; both black
and white, and raise their voices in pro-
test against theSA regime. Enough is
enough. We want to taste the fruits of
peace, nationhood, national unity,
human dignity and justice.

there to mislead, confuse and distort
the truth of the liberation struggle.
Etango, the socalled religiouscultura!
group rules with the Bible andthe gin.
Has no-one told these organisations
that Namibians are not communists:
they are oppressed instead by those
who brought the Word of God to Africa.
The oppressors also infiltrate black
schools by means of involvement in
sport, and cadets.

Recently, two makakunyasfrom 101
and 202 Battalions respectively, spoke
of discrimination within the socalled
SWATF; said they were forced to fight
on the side of Unita in Angolan ter-
ritory; and resignations have started
because they are not ready to fight
their brothers who want to liberate the
country from the Botha regime. It isa
lesson for us to reject and condemn con-
scription and instead call for the
withdrawal of the SADF from Nami-
bian territory.

The recent invasion of the SADF in.
to Angola: the SADF isthe obstacle to
peace in southern Africa. They are
destabilising the Angolan economy,
and both the SADF and Reagan Ad-
ministration supply the Unita bandits
with Stinger missiles, sophisticated
armaments. The aggressor should stop
fighting for Unita and instead
withdraw its troops from Angolan soil
A Resolution was adopted inthe UN
callingonthe SADF’s withdrawal from
Angola. The SA representative
responded that they would not
withdraw unless foreign troops were
withdrawn from Angola. This is unac-
ceptable and stubborn because the
MPLA Government has never
declared war against South Africa;
Fapla troops have never attacked or oc-
cupied SA territory; Angola is a
sovereign country which hastheright
to choose its own friends. |

Namibiansshould unite; both black
and white, andraise their voices in pro-
test against theSA regime. Enough is
enough. We want to taste the fruits of
peace, nationhood, national unity,
human dignity and justice.

IN THE WAKE of Christmas and my
dealings with The Namibian during
1987 I fee) myself competled to write
you this letter in my personal capaci-
ty in order toset the record straight on
the real meaning of the words peace
and goodwill.

After an in-depth study and research
on the reporting as presented by The
Namibian during the past year | come
to the conclusion that no objectivity
was portrayed by your newspaper con-
earning the South West Africa situa.
tion. Instead, you tried to portray the
enemy, Swapa including all tts wings
and associates as the “peace-seekers”
Nowhere could I find a call to stop ac.
tions by these organisations which are
detrimental to our country and all its
inhabitants, such as boycotts,
sabotage, etc. No, you rather opted to
go for the “alternative view’ of
revolution.

Let me give you only one example:
Justabout every week some kind of ac-
trocity by the security forces was
reported. The security forces spelt 1ot
out clearly that no atrocities by
members of the security forces
would be tolerated. Members who
are found guilty by a court of law will
be punished accordingly. However,
when Swapo claimed responsibility for
the bomb blast at the Gustav Voigts
Centre you reported it to be “a
demonstration of Namibian people's
resolve to shake off the yoke of col-
onialism by all necessary means”. Is
this promoting peace and goodwill?

Swapo opted for the revolutionary
methods some 21 years ago and let us
be honest, they've lost face, both
militanly and politically Although
you portray this organisation tobe the
“true liberatora” of this country, |
guarantee that freedom will be
something of the past IF they should
take over the reins. Howevar, that ia
hardly to be foreseen.

In you socalled “bumper edition’
dated December 18, 1987, to January
8, 1888, you predict another year of war
in your ’polstical perspective” column,
however, in the same breath you cal!
upon organisations and individuals
“to re-agsesa and come up with a con-
crete and effective plan of action to
break the chains in 1988 andreachthe
goal ofa free Namibia’ Thus, 1 accept
that you areatthesametime wishing
for peace and war. This isa contradic.
tion I'll never be able to understand

Please keep in mind: Swapo opted for
war. This is what they got. The securi-
ty forces were in being long before the
existence of Swapo and if you look at
the aim of any defence force in the
world, you will notice that their duty
{s, amongst other, the safeguarding of
life, property and freedom, During

1988 the security forces will maintain
this aim!

May | wish you not a worldly “hap:

ALLOW me to express my heartfelt
disgust at Commandant G R C
Bester's childish, hopeless and self-
defeating comments which regularly
appear in this newspaper.

Asa patriotic and oppreesed Nami.
bian citizen, I really feel compelledto
respond to Commandant Bester’s
narrow-minded allegations against
the editor of this newspaper in par-
ticular and the entire oppressed but
fighting people of Namibia under the
leadership of Swapo.

I would like to make itcategorically
clear to Commandant Bester and his
masters in Pretoria that Swapo isthe
people of Namibia and the people are
Swapo. If South Africa is trying to
destroy Swapo, then they must be try-
ing to destroy the the suffering Nami-
bian people. But the apartheid regime
will not succeed in destroving the peo
ple’s movement. The apartheid govern
ment has been trying to bring Swapo
ta its knees for vears, but all therr ef-
forts were in vain

They have even tried to infiltrate the
organisation with spies, but none of
their dubious attempts have
succeeded.

Commandant Bester went on to ask
a foolsh and shortsighted question
“Who opted for revolution?” The
answer issimple and clear: Swapo. But
the next question to which he should
provide us witha proper answer is why
Swapo resorted to armed liberation
struggle.

Swapo Secretary General, Andimba
Toivo ya Toivo made the movement's
position clear in the Sixties: “Swapo
itself was a non-violent organisation.
but the South African government 13s
not truly interested in whether oppos!
tion is violent or non-violent. It does
not wish to hear any opposition to
apartheid”

Furthermore, Swapo President Sam
Nujoma. made clear the position of
Swapo with regard to the people's
revolution against colonial oppression
and exploitation at the WCC con.
ference in Lusaka last year. He said:

“On the question of violence, we make
no apology for the fact that afleracen-
tury of foreign oppression, genocidal
military campaigns and unbridled
economic exploitation, our movement
had decided totake up arms toconfront
colonial violence with armed self-
defence. It ig enshrined 1n our move-
mnent’s political programme that
Swapo does not glorify war We wish
that nobody hadever forced ustohave
to fight a war of national liberation

But the reality of prolonged colonial
oppression in Namibia being what it
is, we have been left wath no alter

nateve but to fight with armisin hand
for our liberty and right to self:
determination and independence To
those who would advise us not to fight
colonial oppression with armsin hand,
our answer is: ‘show us the available
non-violenl means to Namibia's rn

dependence and we shall fellow”

The available peaceful means to
Narnibian independence through UN
Resolution 435 has been deliberately
delayed by South Africa for ten years
Since 1981, the Swapo President has
expressed hia genuine willingness to
sign a ceasefire with the South African
regime any where in the world but in
Windhoek or Pretoria. But what was
the response of South Africa? They said
it was ‘premature’ to sign a ceasefire
with Swapo.

On socalled ‘atrocities’ allegedly
committed by Swapo against the
civilian population of this country, this
is wishful and baseless thinking on the
part of the people who have failed to

win the hearts and minds of the op-
pressed Namibians.

If Commandant Bester claims that
Swapo hag no support, then does he
think the over 3000 people whoattend

Katutura were supporters of his
Government?

ALLOW me to express my heartfelt
disgust at Commandant G R C
Bester's childish, hopeless and self-
defeating comments which regularly
appear in this newspaper.

Asa patriotic and oppressed Nami-
bian citizen, I really feel compelled to
respond to Commandant ‘8
narrow-minded allegations against
the editor of this newspaper in par-
ticular and the entire oppreased but
fighting people of Namibia under the
leadership of Swapoa.

I would like to make it categorically
clear to Commandant Bester and his
masters in Pretoria that Swapo is the
people of Namibia and the people are
Swapo. If South Africa is trying to
destroy Swapa, then they must be try-
ing to destroy the the suffering Nami-
bian people. But the apartheid regime
will not succeed in destroying the peo
ple's movement. The apartheid govern.
ment has been trying to bring Swapo
to its knees for years, but all their ef-
forte were in vain

They haveeven tried to infiltrate the
organisation with spies, but none of
their dubious attempts have
succeeded.

Commandant Bester went on to ask
a foolish and shortsighted question
“Who opted for revolution?” The
answer is simple and clear: Swapo. But
the next question to which he should
provide us witha proper answer is why
Swapo resorted to armed liberation
struggle.

Swapo Secretary General, Andimba
Toivo ya Toivo made the movement's
position clear in the Sixties: ‘“Swapo
iteelf was a non-violent organisation,
but the South African government 18
not truly interested in whether oppose.
tion is violent or non-violent. It does
not-wish to hear any opposition to
apartheid”.

Furthermore, Swepo President Sam
Nujoma, made clear the position of
Gwapo with regard to the people's
revolution against colonial oppression
and exploitation at the WCC con-
ference in Lusaka last year. He said:.

“On the question of violence, we make
no apology for the fact that after acen-

military campaigns and unbridled
economic exploitation, our movement
had decided to take up arms to confront
colonial violence with armed self.
defence. It is enshrined in our move-
ment’s political programme that
Swapo does not glorify war. We wish

But the reality of prolonged colonial

our answer is: ‘show us the available

Hiemstre - Ed.) the Youth Desk asks
South Africa toget out of Namibia, and
calla for the speedy implementation of
UN Resolution 435.

We, the Namibians, must not be stop-

AS LONG as I live, I remain flab-
bergasted by the gravity of audacity,
courage and perseverance some people
are endowed with. These are the words
which slip into my mind whenever |
stop to muse over the kind of personaili-
ty of our Bishop Kleopas Dumeni of
ELCIN.

To me the Bishop orchestrates a
typical leader, who, given a chance
wasted by fortune-seekers and
hypocritical politicians in thiscountry,
will or can lead Namibia into blossom-
ing tomorrows.

The Bishop's charisma goes beyond
spiritual confines. It isto me always a
blessing to listen to his sermons and
how I wish, always, he could be allot-
ted the Presidency.

The Bishop displayed metaphysical
courage and boldness at the recent
mass funeral of victimsof the Oshakati
bank bomb massacre. In the face of a
gruesome and satanic horror which
struck numb the people of the north,
where innocent young lives, including
that of his own daughter, were put to
waste, he said his say and he said it
right and in a calm and unshaken
voice.

One really wonders atthe charisma
this man of God haa, for, even if death
struck his family a cataclyamic blow,
almost thrice in a row, he goes forth to
console his parishioners, when he
should himeelf sit and be consoled.

I was offended by the hypocritical
condolence from Louis Pienaar andde
Wet of Sector 10, who ironically pledg-
ed a police investigation and the ap-
prehension of culprits, forgetting that
they, including a confused Kozonguizi,
have already branded Swapo
responsible.

Why didn't the master of ceremony
at ‘Kandaha’ Dumeni’s funeral repeat
such soothing condolences from Sam
NujomaofSwaporather than wasting
time to read messages from those
nonentities? IfPienaar andde Wet can
heed Bishop Dumeni’s cal] on
February 27 and withdraw their South
African forces from Namibia and im-
plement UNSCR 435 this year, they
will be saved the energy of sending us
their unwanted condolences
emanating from deaths of such a
nature as on February 19.

I strongly believe in the message
from the Roman Catholic Church that
the Oshakati bomb massacre was a
devilish, rather than a divine will. If
that act was a Godly-premeditated
phenomenon, then God has betrayed
his own commandment ‘Thou shalt
not kill’, and has been incahoots with
enemies to kill innocent souls in the
ban.

Although it is hard to understand,
probably one should follow Bishop
Dumeni’s words of encouragement not
to despair but to trust that the
Almighty will one day crush the teeth
of the enemy and rid Namibia of hor- |
rendous deaths in bomb blasts.

May the Bishop and other bereaved
families be consoled. To the people of
Namibia, unity is strength against the |
bloodstained hands of Pretoria.
Namibia will one day explode with
laughter and peace and not with bomb
blasts.

19880415,19880415,peace,Peace.19880415_page_1.txt,1_2_3,"Church & politics

IS IT possible to talk about church and
politics at the same time? Do the two
have anything in common? Can the
church mix with politica? Such ques-
tions and more similar questions are
struggled with in the context of
Namibia in particular. Such questions
are both theological and political. For-
tunately, theological and political
questions are asked by human beings
who are involved either in the church
and/or politics in one way or another.

My aim here is to open up a
theolagical and political debate for
concerned people in a situation of apar-
theid, colonialism, racism, exploita-
tion and draconian lawssuch as those
of Namibia. I am stating only
preliminary remarks, sparing the rest
for contemplated responses.

The truth of the matter is that the
Church cannot claim its existence
without people Likewise politics can.
not be without people. It is the people
whoconstitute the church. it is the peo-
ple who politicise. The basic concern of
the church is wider and broader than
ity numerical membership. It is within
the framework of the Church's pro-
pheticcall and public responsibility to
aspire for peace, justice, freedom,
respect of human rights and dignity to
all people irrespective of their stations
in life. On the other hand, the Church
is not serving angels, but human be-
ings whose basic needs - among others
- include food, shelter, clothing and
security or safety. In essence, these |

needs cannot be secured without some
forms of political sind economic exer-

- cise. In fact, even if the Church may
manage tochristianise each and every

person on the globe (if that could be
possible) political structures and

| economic systems will be imperative.

Unfortunately we often hear the par-
rotcry that “thechurch should not be
involved or mixed with politics”, as if
there isadivinecommand, especially
given tocertain people, tobe political-
ly involved. |

The irony of the issue is that most of
those whocry loudly that “the church
should or even must not mix with
politics’ are themselves members of
the Church - of whom some may well
still gotochurch on Sundays. The ques-
tion is: where do they hide their
mysterious political bodies and souls
when they go tochurch clothed in their
church body-souls?

It should be known by both believers
and non-believers that the church pro-
claims the God who created the
universe including mother earth. Does
politics take place outside and beyond
this universe? If that is the case, then
the Church would be wrong to be con-
cerned with political oppression and
injustices taking place outside God’s
created cosmos. As far as we know,
politics is done not only on earth but
exercised by these God-created
creatures - human beings. Ontheother
hand, the language of the church
transcends this life to heaven as well.

If politics is touching the lives of
church members in Namibia, how can
it be, that the Church of God of justice
and love can be indifferent to suffering
and the selfish spirit of imperialism?
Ifthe Church’s mission before all else
is supernatural - preaching only
reward in heaven whenone diesand let
misery sndoppression inthis life pass
unabated - then no wonder some temp-
ted tocall it the “opium of the people”.
There is no way forthe Church toavoid
auch accusations until the Church
takes up its role of a conscience of 4.con-

WE note the letter from Professor A
Heywood, published in your
newspaper on May 20, 1988, in which
she differs with certain statements
made in an advertisement which was
placed by NPP 435 in the Windhoek
Observer. We would like to respond to
the three major points which she has
raised in her letter:
1) On the question of whether or not
Resolution 435 provides for elections
under joint South African and United
Nations (UN) supervision: Prof
Heywood is quite correct in stating
that ‘‘Resolution 435 and the
documents surrounding it are reflec-
tions of historical reality”. Your cor-
respondent correctly points out that
Resolution 385 (which preceded
Resolution 435 by tlwo-and-a-half
years) declares that free elections be
held under supervision and control of
the UN. However, in order to give effect
to Resolution 385, the Western Five
negotiated a settlement plan for
Namibia with South Africa and
Swapo, which culminated in the
Western Proposal for Settlement
(Security Council Document 5/126386).

This Western proposal was
thereafter ratified by the United Na-
tions Security Council (UNSC) in its
Resolution 435 (1978) and as such
forms part of the resolution.

In Resolution 431 of July 27, 1978,
the Security Council took note of the
Western Proposals, and requested the
Secretary-General to submit a report
containing his recommendations tor
the implementation of the Western
Proposals. Thus the Western Proposals
were accepted by the UNSC in Resolu-
tion 431. In Security Council Docu-
ment S/12827 of August 29, 1978, the
Secretary-General made recommen-

_ dations, as requested in Res 431; later,
in an Explanatory Statement
(8/12869) of September 28, 1978, he ad-
dressed and explained certain con-
cerns raised during consultations with
all the parties involyed. Both of these
documents were approved in Res 435
of September 29, 1978, and the
Western Proposals were approved and
ratified as such by Res 435 (1978).

It is clear from the Western Pro-
posals, although not explicitly stated,
that in effect the elections will be held
ratified as such by Res 435 (1978).

It is clear from the Western Pro-
posals, although not explicitly stated,
that in effect the elections will be held
under the joint supervision and contro!
of South Africa and the UN: paragraph
4 states, “In carrying out his respon-
sibilities, the Special Representative
will work together with the offical ap-
pointed by South Africa (the
Administrator-General) to ensure the
orderly transition to independence.

Paragraph 5 states: *... the United
Nations Special RepreBentative will
have to satisfy himself ai each stage as
tothe fairness and appropriateness of
al] measures affecting the political pro-
cess...’ and‘... may himself make pro-
posals in regard to any aspect of the
political process. ’

Furthermore, paragraph 6 states:
‘‘Theimplementation ofthe electoral
process, including the proper registra-
tion of voters and the proper and timely
tabulation and publication of voting
results, will also have to be conducted
to the satisfaction of the Special
Representative.’

In other words, the Special Represen-
tative does not directly conduct the
electoral process but has joint control,
through his proposed recommenda.
tions and supervisory role. This fact is
attested to by the Assistant Secretary.
General's Information Circular, dated

July 16, 1982, which confirms the ar-
rangements forthe implementation of
Resolution 435 (1978). In paragraph 2,
under the heading ‘Informal Sum.
mary ,itisstatedthat: ‘Theelections
will be undertaken by the South
African Administrator-General and
his administration. Both the
Adminiatrator-Genera| and the
Special Representative of the
Secretary-General will remaininthe
country until independence.”

2) On the question of whether the
Administrator-General appointed by
the South African Government will
administer the country: Prof Heywood
is quite correct in stating that Res 435
provides for ‘‘the withdrawal of South
Africa’s illegal administration from
Namibia and the transfer of power to
the people of Namibia, with the
assistance of the UN in accordance
with Res 385 (1976)"" However, it
should be pointed out that Res 435
(1978) is a compromise plan designed
to remove South Africa’s illegal oc-
cupation in Namibia, with the co.
operation of the South African
representative, the Administrator.
General, as acentral feature tothe im-
plementation of theSettlement Plan.

: 7 ee [ee . ee
It is clear from the documentation
which is attendant upon Res 435 and
its accompanying resolutions, thatthe
Administrator-General and his
department wil] administer Namibia
during the transitional period, but
under conditions in which he will have
to repeal before the elections ‘‘all re-
maining discriminatory or restrictive
laws, regulations and administrative
measures’, which may inhibit the
holding of free and fair elections
(paragraph 7A of Western Proposals).
The arrangements for the release of all
political prisoners will also be the
responsibility of the Administrator.
General (paragraph 7B of Western Pro-
posals). These and al] other necessary
procedures to attain the object of free
and fair elections, will be overseen by,
ratified by, the UN Special Represen-
tative with the assistance of the
civilian component of UNTAG.

On the question of whether the
South African Police/SWA Police will
maintain law and order during the
transitional period: It should be noted
that the United Nations Transitional
Assistance GroupiUNTAG) is not in-
tended to be a police force. Thisisclear
if reference ts made to paragraph 9 of
the Western Proposais which state.
“Primary responsibility for mamtain-
ing law and order in Namibia shall rest
with the existing police forces.” This
Proposal was accepted by the
Secretary-General in his Explanatory
Statement which outlined the Special
Representative’s explicit respon.
sibilities to oversee the existing police
forces. Inthisregard, animportant role
of the Special Representative, assisted
by the civilian component of UNTAG,
will be to take measures against in-
timidation or interference with the |
electoral process, to accompany the ex-
isting police force and to ensure the
good conduct of these forces(paragraph
29 of the Secretary-General’s report
Document $/12827 and the Ex-
planatory Statement S/12869).
Earlier, the Western Proposal had
stated that the exiating police force
would be limited to “the carrying of
small armsin the norma! performance
of their duties” - acondition to be over-
seen by the UNTAG civilian/police
component (paragraph 9, Western
Proposals).

she differs with certain statements
made in an advertisement which was
placed by NPP 435 in the Windhoek

IFIRSTLY, warm greetings tothe staff
lof The Namibian. Please allow me to
voice my opinion in the people's
popular newspaper ‘The Namibian.
lam very worried about the colonial
behaviour of some of the so-called
tribal chiefs in Owambo known as
Gabriel Kautwima and Mr Gottlieb
Dan. These two men are some of the
leaders of the colonial organisation
known as “Etango”’ in Owambo. They
are still refusing the removal of the
racist military-base at Ponhofi Secon-
dary School which caused the the loss
of many lives in the surrounding areas.
especially of the Ponhofi-students.
They are new encouraged by the
Administrator-General, Louis
Pienaar, who has recently announced
that the military base at Ponhofi will
not be removed.

Please you two chiefs, are you 80
blinded by P W Botha that youcan't see
how your nation is suffering under the
Botha-regime who is using you as his
protectors? Do you know who Mr Louis
Pienaar is? Do you know who he
represents here? He is not and wil
never represent the Namibian people!
He is there for the benefit of the racist
South Africa, to protect and promote
the crucial laws and policies of South
Africa.

Louis Pienaar has nothing todo with
the demands of the majority of the
Namibian people.

You, Kautwima and Dan have recent-
ly said that your lives are worth more
than those hundreds of young suffer-
ing Namibian students. This only
shows that you lack patriotic feelings
and instead represent the racist-
Botha-government.

Itseems as if you are not far from tak-
ing an oath of allegiance in the South
African Government, like Mr. Moses
Katjiongua have done, whois ignoring
his own people and instead protecting
South Africa’s racist policies and laws.

The Namibian people are demanding

AN open letter to Nanso diasiderits:
I (Katjiua, Rukoro, Makari, Zauana,

Karamata, Tjimune and Siririka):

I would like to reply to your long letter
which appeared in The Namibian of
July 15 in which you shamelessly
revealed your anti-Swapo sentiments
(or fears of Swapo).

lam responding to your letter in my
capacity asaSwapo member andl am
in no way stating Swapo's policy on
political rivals, however, I believe that
the overwhelming majority of Swapo
supporters would agree with me.

No doubt you belong to the ethnic
party which is trying to unfairly be
called an equal of Swapo inthe libera-
tion struggle. I myself, initially, and
until very recently, wrongly believed
that Swapo should join hands with
what is referred to (sometimes wrong:
ly) progressive groupings against the
common enemy.

But after your letter and your party
Secretary General’s (properly termed)
‘thinly-veiled attack on Swapo at
Okahandja, I have changed my mind
and suggest that this idea be
relinquished.

If vou want competition with Swapo,
the movement is not worried by that,
and will not participate in the competi-
tion because it is too busy with the
struggle for independence at this
critical stage. You have plenty of time
todothat, I guess. However your com-
petition will only be meaningful ifyou
join hands with South Africa and its
allies, but Swapo is determined to fight
South Africa and its allies at all costs.
You give the impression that you agree
with Mr P W Botha whosaid he would
not tolerate a Swapo government in
Windhoek. But I must remind you that
a Swapo government is inevitable
despite this remark by the South
African State President, because he is
in no position to prevent this and
neither are you. Would you opt for ban-
ditry (Unita style)? I would leave this
patriotic question to you and your
conscience.

In conclusion | would like to refer you
to what Mr Emil. Appolus had to say

Costs of 435

WHAT many Namibians have warned
against for many years has now come
to pass. As soon as the South African
Government tells us of ‘agreement’
with regard toimplementation of 435,
we are informed that it will cost
billionsandthe UN must now look for
the money.

For years, all UN resolutions aimed
at preserving the natural wealth of our
country, have been ignored by South
Africa and all those nations exploiting
our natural resources. South African
occupation of Namibia costs millions
aday but no money is available for the
implementation of the peace plan.
Salaries of South Africa’s proxies in
Namibia have been increased time and
again and for that, money was

available. And in all this, Namibians
had no say, they only paid taxes.

While we are not overexcited at thie
point that the agenda for implementa-
tion will follow the time schedule that
was indicated by the SA Foreign
Minuater, the time has come for Nam.
bians to state their position with
regard to who will foot the bill Surely
we cannot accept that our country has
become a poor and underdeveloped and
dependent country all of a sudden
Therefore we would like to make some
suggestions to the UN Secretary
General who will now be presented
with the bill

Asa people whohave remained self.
reliant through the ages, we would not
hke to become international beygars
at this point and would lhke to con
tribute towards the costs of implemen
tation of UNSCR 435

A few suggestions for Namibians to
ponder

Namibia still has some resources
therefore we propose that an indepen.
dent commission be established im
mediately with complete insight into
all transactions involving monies leav-
ing this country, with immediate
effect,
_ that all export of Namibian natural
resources be monitored by the UN and
all resources accruing therefore, be put
in a fund towards paying for
implementation;
= that with immediate effect, all
monies collected through sales tax be
paid into the abovementioned fund;
C that the exhorbitant salaries paid
to SA proxies in Namibia be im-
mediately stopped and that money be

pat in the abovementioned
all know that the AG andthe BA
civil service runs Namibla and they
should receive salaries from the ool-
onial] power according to international
Practice;
O thatal) these companies which, ac-
cording to the Thirion Report, have
been sending out natural resources il-
legally, or have paid leas taxes than
they should have, be compelled to pay
the said amounts in the implementa.
tion fund;
J that all taxes paid by Namibiansin
order to fund second tier authorities,
be channelled into the said fund.

Since the people of this country have
never hed a say in whathappenstothe
funds collected through the means
above, they should do eo now. The six
points mentioned above are only
pointers. We realise there should be
some control and therefore suggest
that all those parties which have been
in favour of the implementation of 435
now form a watchdog committee and
take this issue up immediately. All
Namibians know that thesaid parties
are constituent members of the /Ai-
/Gams group

Namibiang, the time has come for
you to take up this challenge.

Costs of 435

WHAT many Namibians have warned
against for many years has now come
to pass. As soon as the South African
Government tells us of ‘agreement’
with regard toimplementation of 435,
we are informed that it will cost
billionsand the UN must now look for
the money.

For years, all UN resolutions aimed
at preserving the natural wealth of our
country, have been ignored by South
Africa and all those nations exploiting
our natural resources. South African
occupation of Namibia costs millions
aday but no money is available for the
implementation of the peace plan.
Salaries of South Africa’s proxies in
Namibia have been increased time and
again and for that, money was

available. And in all this, Namibians
had no say, they only paid taxes.

While we are not overexcited at this
point that the agenda for implementa-
tion will follow the time schedule that
was indicated by the SA Foreign
Minister, the time has come for Nami-
bians to state their position with
regard to who will foot the bill Surely
we cannot accept that our country has
become a poor and underdeveloped and

My dear Namibiana, do you know
that there are eeven chief human

water to drink and for domestic pur-

our houses; sufficient clothing to keep
us warm and enable us to conform with
accepted standards of decency; fire or
fuel to enable us to cook our food: and
a shelter to protect us from the sun,
wind and rain

If the Namibian nation is deprived
of these needs by a certain greedy
group of people, that greedy grouperrs
against God's will and against the
whole of humanity. So. no government
(nobody) has right to keep away these
natural wants from any individual

agree with me that the strugglo is over
the land in the first place? The im-
perialist governments are not in-

the Namibians They certainly donot
love us but they just fell deeply in love
with the land Namibia because she 1s
very rich. Now they are raping our
motherland. America, Britain, West
Germany and many other European
countries are more interested in
mineral resources our land produces
and not inthe Namibian people.

The South African soldiers and police
killed many Namibians because of the
land not because Namibianscommit-

of this fact that they must struggle, not
for a sce of bread or a loafofbread, but
for the whole bakehouse. We muat free

LET mecomplainabout the atrocities
allegedly committed by Koevoet or
-SADF. On Monday 18.7.88 at'midday,
at least six Casspirs allegedly ap-
peared at Oshandi village in Eenhana
vicinity. Mrs Lucia Muleka (66), wife
of later deceased Neghipityoova at
Oshandi, was on her way to fetch water
from a nearby well when one of those
Casspirs ran over her.

Without telling anybody, they
(Koevoet)picked her up and put her in
their vehicle then they drove back.

westwards of the village. When the
family of Mrs Muleka waited forsome
information of whereabout their per-
son, they did not hear anything about
her until on 26.7.88. On Wed nesday,
27.7.88, the family members started
Inquiring about her in all hospitals
and later suddenly thdy found hercor-
-pse in Oshakati State Hospital's mor-
tury. Nu more information had been
received at the time of writing this
letter, |

The same had happened when on
‘Sunday 24.7.88 at 17h15(5h15)seven
Casspirs(wolf)and one Buffelalleged”
ly appeared at Oheti village, the
neighbouring village of Oshandi. They
came to certain cuca-shops inquiring
on the whereabouts of two plan com.
batants who ‘had been reported found’
in the same area. When those who
were shopping at those cuca-shops
answered that they did not see those
men, the Koevoet men started beating
people with butts and fists, kicking
everyone who was shopping; and it
didn’t matter ifit wasa very aged man
or woman.

Among those badly injured were
Miss Maria Hamutenya (22) who was
told to lie down on the floor and beat-
tenon the buttocks with a palm stick;
Lucas Bhoefeni(19)a studentat Haim.

bili Haufikiku Sec. Schoo! (Benhana)
was beaten and left lying on the
ground; Miss Mbishi (31) who was hit
in both eyes and she is still unable to
see.

Several other assaults committed by
Koevoet were reported inthe same two
villages (Oshandi and Ohedi). On on
Monday 25.7.88 they beat Mr Nakale
Levi, a school teacher at Malangu
Primary School ( Oshandi) while he
was busy lecturing. He was badly in-
jured and left senseless lying on the

‘ground.

Koevoet also steal from shaps
without payment but fortunately, the —
nation’s eyes are open.

Most ofthe atrocities aré committed
by the black soldiers While often white
soldiers sit in vehicles, looki ngatand —
laughing when black soldiers beat
their own people. Therefore, | would
dike to say especially to black soldiers
totake note and respond to the follow.
ing facts:

-itisnotthetimeto commit atrocities
to your own people:

-remember that those people against
whom you discriminate wil] remain
your own people, your fathers, mothers,
brother and sisters:

- there will no day when white soldiers
will truly love you black Koevoet:

-it is time for you to throw away your
uniforms;

-leave the SA regime and let us unite
together in protest against SA regime
to taste the fruitsof peace, nationhood,
national unity, human dignity and
justice.

To my beloved Namibians,
like to say tobe silentisacrime, ga let
Us raise up our voices about whatever
they do to us.

Then let uscall for Resolution 435 to

implemented right now!

ALLOW me tocomment on the letter
which appeared in The Namibian of
August 05, under the heading
“Pallacious’ written by V T Kavari.

I've been present al the Nanso con:
yrcsses since 1986¢ second congress) up
to this year with the fourth congress.
where I've experienced a spirit of
brotherhood.

What I have observed is that after &
speaker has delivered a speech, oppor:
tunity was given to the house for
discussion, questions, correction, ad.
dition, clarification, comment, etc.

I believe this was done so that with
the departure of the congress no com:
rades could go to their respective
places with unsolved problems as it ap
pears to be in your case.

I'm just wondering whether you
never got the opportunity to air your
viewsand to gopersonally tothe NEC
Members, instead of doing it in the
newspapers and to create a tasteless
spirit among the students, which 1s
totally unnecessaFy.

If you were at the congress you will
remember that comrade Shihwamen!
was the last person to clarify on this
issue. |

He explained that people have to
make the difference between 4 pro
gressive parly and a liberation move-
ment. He went on saying that pro-
gressive parties are mostly concerned
with ethnic issues, while Swapo which
‘sa liberation movement, is aimed at
liberating all the peace loving people
in Namibia irrespective of their col-
ours, ethnic groups, etc.

This is a fact that we, in Namibia
have to accept that Swapo is the only,
only armed movement that isfighting
(uniess, a8 Shinwameni said, “there is
another armed movement that 1s
hiding underground’)

Whatcomrade Steve saidat the con-
gress on this issue was positive and I,
with the majority accepted it, although
you differed as you said, in your letter.
Of course, minorities always differ!

RE is another sfde tothe story of J
the socalled “Ten years of peace in East
Caprivi’ (The Windhoek Advertiser,
August 26). It has not had ten years of
peace as Brigadier Gert Nel suggests:
it HAS been ten years of humiliation
and intimidation.

Iregard this report as an attempt to
invalidate the very successful Swapo
rally held in the region on August 20,

as wellastodiscredit Capriviansin the
eyes of fellow Namibians. Brigadier
Nel’s tong report on the socalled ‘peace’
is mere propaganda.

Leaders have been intimidated and
harassed by the SADF and its counter-
part, Swapol, formerly SAP. The socall-
ed ‘leaders’, as claimed by Brigadier
Nel, are instruments used to further
the prevailing status quo. The tradi-
tional leaders are merely the
equivalents of the Katjiuonguas and
Matyplas of Namibia.

As regards what Brigadier Nel calls
‘cooperation’ between the army and
civilians, I have the following to say:

* intense psychological war is at work
in the region; 7

* the people do not admire the SADF
or SWATF, because it is not their army,
but South Africa's, The civilians may
‘cooperate with the army because they
need to survive; but itis not out of their
own will. Their fear is legitimate.

The bitter irony behind the creation
of 701 Battalion is that most young
men have joined the army as a last
resort. The rate of unemployment in
Caprivi is so high that people are left [
with two major options: to join the ar-
my, undesirable as that is, or become
a teacher. |

The SADF and Swapol have repress-
ed any sign of protest so that may give
an illusion of ‘peace’ in the region.

Regarding Enok/FNDC, this com-
pany may be credited with
monopolistic and exploitative prac-
tices in the region. It is notorious for
paying low wages, and they are cer-
tainly not contributing to any develop-
ment worth mentioning

The Namibian must not fall into a
trap of distorted reporting, because it
ig internationally credited for its objec.
tive reporting.

It was reported in The Namibian
how the principal of Secondary School
Katuturacalled inthe police toarrest
the pupils. [t was further reported that
the pupils were disappointed by their
principal's actions.

In the first place, the principal did
1 is how it is done at all schools under
these situations. ‘According to your
report, pupils were disappointed at my
actions. Those were not my actions.
But I was very much disappointed at
the behaviour of my pupils, because
they did not ask the “foreign” pupils
not to use abusive language towards
me.

I did not and do not deserve that
treatment frompupils,andthehonest |
pupils of my school can testify this. =
wanted to address thecrowd but seem.
ingly the only response pupils know ig
“Down, down and once again down”,
clapping handsand dance-running. To
my shock and surprise, “foreign”
pupils took the fire brigade hoapipers
chased me away with water and stones.
Even my pupils who participated in
these actions did not even try to stop
the others from doing it.

The police are on patrol all over
Katutura and more especially around
our school because you made it a soft
target in order to either discredit me
or to put members of my staff under
scrutiny, and they can see for
themselves what is going on at the
school. Why don't you give all schools
as tough a time as you do with us: why
do you concentrate on two or three
schools only? Do you have some
motives or are you bribed to discredit
some schools?

As president of NAMTA (Namibia -
Teachers Association), I want to
reiterate my organization's point viz.
that we do have understanding with

- most demands, but we can't condone
endless boycotts. We admire those who
continue with it but salute the others
who want to continue their studies.

“movement .and. a leader
‘movement. ==. |
“The student movement still temains

united as before. Whathappened at the
congress was mere recognition and
acknowledgement of the reality that
Swapo is the leader of the liberation
movement, let alone being the only
liberation movement. Kavari, in fact
should show cause why Nanso must
not acknowledge Swapo leadership of
the national liberation struggle. I feel
strongly thattoaccept the unavoidable
reality that Swapo leads the nation
liberation struggle does not make us
politically affiliated to Swapo.

What is surprising for Kavari's let-
ter and all others who seem to be con-
cerned with Nanso’s socalled pro-
Swapo stand, isthat noneofthem men-
tioned the current crisis in education.
An impression is given that Nanso’s
recognition that Swapo leads the
liberation struggle is more evil and
criminal than the current crisis in
education. Meetings after meetings
are called and proposed not to address
the crisis, but Nanso. Nanso now has
become the crisis. Kavari talks of
another national student movement
as a possibility, simply because Nan-
so has recognized Swapo leadership of
our struggle. IfNanso had recognized
or named the HNP as a progressive
party, than one would understand and
conceptualize the cry of Kavari et al.
If Nanso had failed to address the cur-
rent crisis properly and Kavari et al
talk of another student movement
which shall address the crisis in a bet-
ter way, one would understand their
cry. But thecry issimply because Nan-
so says Swapo leads our nation at war
with SA colonizers. Swapo, the pro-
greasive movement, the organizer of
victories of our people in their heroic
anti-colonial and anti-imperialist
struggle, has suddenly become the
crisis now in which energies must be
expended. The colonizera are now
given’ peace and their deliberately
created crisis ia not ad eased, Then.

acknowledgement of the Rai that
Swapo is the leader of the liberation
movement, let alone being the only
liberation movement. Kavari, in fact
should show cause why Nanso must
not acknowledge Swapo leadershipof
the national liberationstruggle. I feel
strongly thattoaccept the unavoidable
reality that Swapo leads the nation
liberation struggle does not make us
politically affiliated to Swapo.

What is surprising for Kavari's let-
ter and all others who seem to be con-
cerned with Nanso’s secalled pro-
Swapo stand, isthat noneofthem men-
tioned the current crisis in education.
An impression is given that Nanso’s
recognition that Swapo leads the
liberation struggle is more evil and
criminal than the current crisis in
education. Meetings after meetings
are called and proposed not to address
the crisis, but Nanso. Nanso now has
become the crisis. Kavari talks of
another national student movement
as a possibility, simply because Nan-
so has recognized Swapo leadership of
our struggle. IfNanso had recognized
or named the HNP as a progressive
party, than one would understand and
conceptualize the cry of Kavari et al.
If Nanso had failed to address the cur-
rent crisis properly and Kavari et al
talk of another student movement
which shall address the crisis in a bet-
ter way, one would understand their
cry. But thecry issimply because Nan-
so says Swapo leadsour nation at war
with SA colonizers. Swapo, the pro-
greasive movement, the organizer of
victories of our people in their heroic

According tothe current talks
South Africa and America introdaced

ing their best to switch the burden of
talks to the opposite parties - will
Angola accept all the SA. and
American demands? If yes, what will
happen to Angola next?
We rejected the connection of Cubans
to the independence of Namibia and

wore and are still demanding the

withdrawal of the S.A. troops and ita il-

one of either parties (South Africa or
America) is willing to listen to us as
they are in favour of war. South Africa
staysin Walvis Bay even after UNSCR
435 is implemented - what then?

We are intimidated by the SA.
regime with its apartheid laws and
military atrocities. It is preaching its
“goodness” to win the hearts and
minds of the people, but we suffered for
a long time under its colonial regime.
It is still continuing to minimize our
political rights - how will we continue
with talks?

Cubans were willing to help Angola
from the intimidation we expenencing
here and their presence in Angola is
legal. As long as the intimidation to
the Namibian people continues
Angola cannot be saved.

Those who are threatened by the
presence of Cubans in Angola are the
“Terreblanche group’ of the South
African regime, who want to exploit
the Angolan people and its allies. Once
the Cubans withdraw from Angola the
‘“Terreblanche speech” in the past few
days will be manifested practically.

The Namibian people welcome the

No to homelands

THE tnbalists who are trying to
divide this country into homelands
must be made to remember that our
nation cannot tolerate such divisions
in Namibia. The land is one, and the

e are one. Our nation must stand
firm in unity to fight against all forms
of divisions and homclands in the

country. Things like the socalled
Republic of Rehoboth and Caprivi
cannot be tolerated in the would-be
independent Namibia.

_ Those who are involved in organi-
sing such things must repentand give
up such reactionary ideas immedi-
ately. This country is one, from the
Angolan border to the Orange River,
and from the Zambian border to the
Aduantic Ocean.

We find it disturbing that we still
have brainwashed Afncan (Namib-
ian) intellectuals who believe in
homelands and tibalism when we
have our heroes who have died for
the freedom of Namibia as a whole.
] just wonder from which books these
people have gathered such mislcad-
ing information.

These people should know that itis
utterly irresponsible and a marked
betrayal of those who died fighting
for the independence of Namibia as
well as the masses in this county.
Those people should also know that
their actions are a sign of mental
subjugation, and what J would call
the disease, requires an antidote.
Luckily, unlike Aids, an anudote is
available. People involved in declar-
ing homelands in Namibia must take
the undistorted history books and
read. perhaps this will make they
realise that they owe apologies to
faithful Namibians.

I appeal to our brothers and sisters
in Rehoboth and C aprivi not to sup-
port the people trying to lead them
into total nco-colonialism. All Na-
mibians must have the freedom to
live where they want to; and not be
confined to certain regions.

Swapo has been fighting to rid use
of the colonial yoke of South Africa
and the movement accepts all patri-

Reply to Matjila

IN your first issue for 1989. Mr
Matjila is reported as having
indignantly repudiated, on behalf
of the nation, an ECOSOC Com-
mission finding thal the situation
of Namibian women necds ur-
gentattention. More specifically,
he declares himself sausfied with
the manner in which violence
against women is handicd by law
enforcement agencies and the
courts.

The Minister 1s enutled tq his
personal opinion on what
ures are ‘strict’ and what punish-
ments ‘appropnate ’. But the real-
ity is not sorcassuring. Aticntited
readers of the English language
wecklies - especially reports of
criminal and divs-ce proceedings
- will have noticyd that violence
against women is escalating al an
alarming rate, and that there has
been no noticeable suffening of
the penalties for rape in order to
arrest the trend.

The reality is this: rape is a
capital offence, and all reported
incidents must therefore be tried
by the Supreme Count. In 1986
160 cases were reported, of which
94 were brought to wial, In 1987
the figures were 201 reported and
114 tried, in 1988 266 and 67

respectively. It must be bome in-
mind that the shadow figures for |
sexual assault are always higher —
than the numbers of cases re- —
ported tothe police. In Namibiait —

has also been a general rule that

aggravated by breaking and en-
tering, theft, grievous bodily harm
or murder are prosecuted at all,
Of the 637 cases of rape re-
ported in the past three years, 204

- will have noticfd that violence
against women Is escalating al an
alarming rate, and that there has
been no noticeable suffening of
the penalties for rape in order to
arrest the trend.

The reality is this: rape is a
capital offence, and all reported
incidents must therefore be tuned
by the Supreme Count. In 1986

160 cases were reported, of which
94 were brought to tial, In 1987
the figures were 201 reported and
114 tried, in 1988 266 and 67
respectively. It must be bome in-
mind that the shadow figures for |
sexual assault are always higher |
than the numbers of cases re-
ported to the police. In Namibiait —
~ has also been a general rule that
only cases of rape which are
aggravated by breaking and en-

‘A sensitive nerve

Indeed Mr Shipanga's ‘New Year's
Message’ touched a sensitive nerve
in me, especially with the untruths
and political dishonesty that ‘mes-
sage’ displayed.

In his article (27/01/89) Mr Shipanga
implies that because Father Wolfe
had said that ‘‘reconciliation of the
Namibian people as a whole is needed
before we can become one Namibia
one Nation’’, then anybody who uses
the word ‘reconciliation’ on televi-
sion must go unchecked. Mr Shipanga,
reconciliation is not merely an event
- it is a process in which not only
what we say, but also what we do,
will determine the essence of our
determination.
~ So do not think that people will
believe your sincenty because you
use the words ‘peace’ and ‘reconcili-
ation’, even more so when your frame
of reference is artificial: (that your
TGNU protected the rights of Na-
mibians during the past. three-and-a-
half years).

| maintain, Mr Shipanga, that your
Cabinet sided with the South Afncan
‘government in trying to stop duc
legal process, and I add that all this
was done at the expense of the tax-
payers, Please say this is not true, and
tell the Namibian people what posi-
tion did you take, and what you as
Cabinet did in the interest of due
legal process in the iste Wapota and
| *Shifidi cases.

Taleo maintain that national cam-
paigns and international diplomatic
- gnd economic pressure forced the |
ence.

a) National campaigns:

- When the churches marched on
_ the side of the poor (Corpus Chnst)
gangs from some government circles
could not stop them. When Kameeta
gave that emouonal address at St
Andrews in Khomasdal, the people
were moved to action, and more
Koevoet was armed and deployed on
the strects of Katutura

- When Swapo held a public rally
after five years of silence, fifteen
thousand people came. Apartheid
shivered in Namibia and police and
army tactics were adjusted as evident
in the circumstances surrounding the
death of Shifidi.

- When concerned namibians as-
sisted workers to bind together in
defence of their rights, their lives, -
an action which culminated in the —
organised workers movement sec- —
ond to none in the history of Namibia —
- your Cabinet moved in with bills to —
serve that initiative a death —

blow, and thanks to, yes, national
r | iy 1
law, and it was thus stillbom, re-
member? Remember the ILO expen-
ence when your cabinet was trying to
Jobby against the Namibian workers
for fear of ‘political manipulation’?
All your actions did not succeed be-
cause the workers were always astep
ahead of your cabinet.

Mr Shipanga, if this is not ‘na-
tional campaigns , what is?

(b) International campaigns:

Well, inthe interest of spacc I shall
not dwell, because after all itis obvi
OUuS:

- thatitis because of intemational
diplomatic and economic pressure
on the government in South Africa
that your TGNU was not recognised
by a single country as such.

- that the South Afncan Rand has
and continues to plunge, to the extent
thal (as you correcuy pomt out) South
Afnca had to recognise that it cannot
continue to enforce her preferences
through intermediaries of her unilat-
eral choice; and that the cost of re-
taining control has come to, and in
fact has long exceeded, the benefit.

It is in this Context interesting to
note what South African Minister of
Finance, Barend du Plessis, said in a
recent interview in Leadership (a South
African journal),

Mr du Plessis was asked a question
on sanctions and he said: (paraphrased)
the question of sanctions is rather
delicate to discuss because, if you
say they are not working, you are
inviting more; and if you say they are
working, you are inviting more.

This | think is indicative of inter-
national diplomatic and economic
| pressure on South Africa. Suffice it
| to quickly add that national and in-
- termational campaigns are necessar-
ily complementary.

Finally I am surprised that Mr

Reply to Shipanga

THIS letter follows one by Mr
Vezera Kandetu (The Namibian
Jamuary 14 1989) and to the reply by
Mr Andreas Shipanga. I was going to
stat my mouth al this ume, and merely
hope that the future would bring me
and fellow Namibians the best.

When Shipanga joined the TGNU
he knew very well that they would be
tesponsible to the Government of
South Africa, and he chose to fight
for freedom, liberty and self-deter-
mination with the South African
Government, with Botha ‘leading the
revolution’ and the Administrator
General es the man in charge of the
socalled ‘defenders’ of the nghts of
Nanubians.

What does Shipanga mean when
he says ‘It is just this sort of hubns
which has hampered the struggle for
truc liberation in Namibia forsolong
and encouraged the armchair revolu-
lionaries to waste their words and
deeds on irtelevancies’.

To tell the truth, Shipanga is one of
those who hampered the struggle for
true Liberation if he remembers what
he did in 1978: he divided the froe-
doen fighters. And the description in
question fis him very well. Lei me
say, he has been an annchair revolu-

tionary who hes been wasting his
words and deeds, by way of
tb Namiblen people along nie
Eeeets, Th potio of he and his

colleagues made the South African
Government realise that they could
not enforce its rule through Namib-
ian intermediaries, and so they went
to the negotiating table.

The TGNU never had the power to
decide, and the South Afncan Gov-
emment got what it wanted from the
interim government.

Swapo would like united people as
itis their mMouo to unite the Namibian
people. But how can it succeed in
uniting the people if there are those
hike yourself who are always divid-
ing the nation. Swapo will unite and
join hands with fellow Namibians in
order to build up the nation you dis-
appointed, and the beloved land you
betrayed.

On the question of your call on
Swapo to release the detainces it is
holding, that is none of your busi-
ness. After all, some of these things
are already provided for in accor-
dance with UNSCR 435 (1978) and
629 (1989), and all dates and events
are based upon the Annex to the
settlement Proposal S/12636 of Apni
10 1978, just in case the South Afri-
can Government hasn't bnefed you.

Why didn’t the intenm govern-
ment repeal laws such as AG 26:
many Namibians have been detained
without trial, and the interim govern-
ment did not question this.

There are no atrocities in Swapo

INTHE last edition of The Nemib-
ion and some other newspaper, I had
the opportunity to read what some
ssembers of the SADF were saying
about comnasenian. Before I say
anything about the subject, I would
like to mform readers that I was born
and brought up in the communis!
state of Yugoslavia. I might add that
while living and working m mry home
town I had always refused offers to
become a member of the Communist
Party.

According to what these army
members say, which can also be taken
as the gencral opmion of Namibian
whites, particularly farmers, com-
munism means dictatorship which
includes the killing pf polincal oppo-
nents, oppréssion, exploitation, pov -
exty and others abuses of human nghis.

Many of them regard anyone who
opposes the apartheid system and
white mmonty rule as a communist
or even, terrorist. I belseve that these
that this socio-political system in
which we live, or have been forced to
live, 1s one of the best. Onc thing is
sure, it is some kind of capitalism.

It is as unwise to say: Chnstianity
is better than Islam or the other way
around, as it is to say or think that
capitalism is better than communism
Or vice versa.

Of course any soci-polincal struc-
ture benefits someone profitably. If
we compare communismos and capt-
talismos, let's say according to the
number of private-owned cars and
television seis, we will have the
impression that capitalism is much
better. But if you look at other things
m the capitalist society, like the number
of suicides, drug seddicts, kidnap-
pings and terrorist attacks, then we
have another picture. It seems to me
that people in the capitalist world are
not so free and happy. Life under
communism is safer and better.

We must also not fail to give atten-
tion to job security in communist
states where it is very difficult to fire
workers from their jobs. Here in
Namibia the firing of workers is

‘normal

If we wanttoleam the facts we will
notice that communism by itself is
not some kind of poverty-maker. In
many communist-ruled states, living

standards are much higher than in
non-communist states; take for ox-
ample Latin America or the Phillipi-

1 nes. None of them are ruled by the

communists but there ero so many
body in the USSR today has enough
food and clothing. | am convinced
that even in the most communist
stales, ciuzens enjoy more democ-
racy, more freedom and more justice
than the majonty here in Namibia.
The waves of protest in the commu-

nist countnes today, like the one in |
Poland, is not directed against the |

communist system itself. The Soli-
danty Union in Poland is not an anu-
communist movernent, which is trying
to destroy the Polish socio-political
structure. In fact, the union leaders
are better communists than thei rulers.

To many of those who so strongly
cTiacise the communist way of life,
communism and marxism mean the
same thing, which 1s also wrong.
Somebody can be communist and

not manust; he can be Stalmist, Maoist |

elc.

I myself do not adhere to any ide-
ology. I concern myself as a Chns-
lian only, but to be a good believer
and Christian does not mean to be
ready to kill communists and non- |
believers.

Rather it is to mean to work to-
gether and work in peace and har-
mony. If we are not prepared to do |

this, our future is bleak. To try to |

bring people to your side by creating
a fear of the unknown is primitive
and cheap propaganda, which as such
is not a part of Western civilisation
which the SADF claims to defend.

Many of them regard anyone who
opposes the apartheid system and
white mmonty rule as a communist
or even, terrorist. I belseve that these
that this socio-political system in
which we live, or have been forced to
live, 1s one of the best. One thing is
sure, it is some kind of capitalism.

It is as unwise to say: Chnstianity
is better than Islam or the other way
around, as it is to say or think that
capitalism is better than communism
Or vice versa.

Of course any socio-polincal struc-
ture benefits someone profitably. If
we compare communismos and capt-
talismos, let's say according to the
number of private-owned cars and
television seis, we will have the
impression that capitalism is much
better. But if you look at other things
m the capitalist society, hike the number
of suicides, drug addicts, kidnap-
pings and terrorist attacks, then we
have another picture. It seems to me
that people in the capitalist world are
not so free and happy. Life under
communism is safer and better.

We must also not fail to give atten-
tion to job security in communist
states where itis very difficult to fire
workers from their jobs. Here in
Namibia the firing of workers is

‘normal procedure"".

If we wantto learn the facts we will
notice that communism by itself is
not some kind of poverty-maker. In
many communist-ruled states, living
standards are much higher than in
non-communist states; take for ox-
ample Latin America or the Phillipi-
1 nes, None of them are ruled by the

Comunmuniats
body in the USSR today has enough |

thal even in the most communist —
states, citizens enjoy more democ-
racy, more freedom and more justice
than the majonty here in Namibia.
The waves of protest in the commu-
nist countnies today, like the one in
Poland, is not directed against the |
communist system itself. The Soli- |
danity Union in Poland is not an anu-
communist movernent, which is trying
to destroy the Polish socio-political
structure. In fact, the union leaders
are better communists than ther rulers.

To many of those who so strongly
criacise the communist way of life,
communism and marxism mean the |
same thing, which is also wrong.
Somebody can be communist and |
not marxist; he can be Stalinist, Maoist |
etc. :
I myself do not adhere to any ide-
ology. I concern myself as a Chns- |
tian only, but to be a good believer
and Chrisuian does not mean to be
ready to kil] communists and non-
believers.

Rather it is to mean to work to-
gether and work in peace and har- |
mony. If we are not prepared to do
this, our future is bleak. To try to |
bring people to your side by creating |
a fear of the unknown is primitive
and cheap propaganda, which as such
is not a part of Western civilisation
which the SADF claims to defend.

On Ahtisaar!

PLEASE allow meto air my views
rogarding the position of Mr Martti
Ahtisaari in the current situation in
our country:

Sir, we are very perplexed by your
attitude tow ards our people under the
leadership of Swapo.

It is amazing that, as UN Special
Representative, who has come to
Namibia to make sure that the inter-
national procedures leading to inde-
pendence, are carried out with jus-
tice and without partiality to any
party, you have given the order to the
troops of South Africa to hunt down
forces who in fact were in the country
prior to the ceasefire.

This, to us who are yearning for
our freedom, clearly demonstrates
that you have taken apanial decision ‘|’
in favour of our colonisers. [tis a pity
that instead of bringing abwut peace,
you are encouraging the forces of the
racist’ government to eliminate
Namibians.

Swapo 1s a well-disciplincd move-
ment and would not defy the guide-
lines and regulations set up and agreed
to conceming our transition to inde-
pendence.

Insteac of deploying Untag
peacekeeping forces to the area of
conflict to separate the warring sides,
you decided in favour of the one side.
Swapo forces then had no alternative
but to defend themselves against those
who started hunting down our com-
batants.

Sir, if justice were to be done, you
would have acted impartially to
solvethe conflict. The Government
in Pretoria may have planned these
acts of violation in advance, to jeopar-
dise the peace process. They knew
long ago that anumber of Plan forces
were based inside Namibia. They
attacked our fighters on the day
implementation of the peace plan
started, and them put the blame on
our forces as the violators of the
peace process.

Then most of the world, including
Margaret Thatcher, started blaming
Swapo; they have most of the media
at their disposal. How can you decide
to assist the racist forces to expel

Gave their lives

AS ONE of the greatest fans of
your newspaper, allow me to air my
views conceming the recent clash
between Swapo combatants and South
Afncan security forces.

First of all, I take my hat off to
those freedom fighters who gave their
lives for us to be free. (Not only
them, but for South African security
forces who didn’t know what they
were doing, may God forgive them).
When I think of those who died, my
blood mins cold. Freedom was so
near and yet so far for them.

Secondly, the members of the UN
who were in favour of the reduction
of Untag from 7500 t0 4650, should
now bow their heads in shame. What
&@ great mistake it was.

According to eyewitnesses, the
security forces fired against the
combatants first. AndI believe them.
One may ask why? Because I cannot
believe someone, who, for 70 years,
has made me a subject of the evil
system called apertheid.
pepe pre Swapo. Why?

blamed because
fought beck in self-defence? Orie
because the US end its allics call

Swapo a ‘terrorist’ organisation?
Swapo is a liberation movement and
we are proud of it. According to
international law and the UN Char-
ter, we have the right to resist South
Afican occupation.

The Untag forces were supposed
to secure peace. Where were they?
The Botha’s are making fools of them.
The UN is now experiencing what we
have experienced for many years.

The Swapo combatants were re-
grouping to be confined to bases
when the security forces fired on
them. Who gave that instruction?
Botha or Ahtisaari?

Last but not least: Untag gives the
green light to South Africa to re-
deploy Koevoet and 101 Battalion to
assist them in their peacekeeping task.
Will a child's heart ever forget who
killed his mother? Will amother ever
forget who raped her ten-year-old
daughter? Some may forgive, but
they will never forget.

We will continue to resist our
occupation: Europe tasted Nazi oc-
cupation and opposed it. We have the
right to do the same.

DTA has chosen to fight against Swapo
rather than South Africa, which has
occupied the country formany years.

Mudge has also been making ac-
cusations about atrocities in Swapo
settlements, something he has no
evidence of. Yet he and his sapport-
ets appear to have Koevoet at their
disposal, who are the culprits as far
as atrocities in Namibia are con-
cerned. Mudge and Kaura are not
happy to see a Namibian nation
marching to freedom. They appear to
be perpetrating tribalism and divi-
sion among the people of this coun-

A few weeks ago K aura was inter-
viewed on the BBC where he claimed
that Swapo leaders were provoking
his supporters and he warned about
‘fights’ which may erupt in Katu-
tura. He also wamed Swapo leaders
that their safety may be jeopardised
if such ‘fights’ break out.

The anti-Swapo propaganda being
carried out by the DTA is the reverse
of the wuth. We have evidence that
the DTA is doing the very things they
accuse Swapo of.

Dirk Mudge and Kaura must real-
ise that in Swapo, they are dealing
with amovement whichis politically
mature. Swapo is not interested in
bringing Namibians into conflict or
the county into neo-colonialism, as
the DTA is doing.

Mudge and Kaura must control
their supporters not to provoke peace-
ful Swapo supporters any longer.
Swapo supporters do not interfere
with the affairs of other groups. Let
us campaign peacefully for the elec-
tions without intimidating anyone.
Mudge and Kaura must know what
the consequences of civil war is - that
is, if they have ready history. We in
Namibia do not want such a situation
here. Our people have suffered for
too long and they need peace and
freedom, which Swapo has and still
stands for.

1. It looks as if Mr Ahtisaari can-

1.1 After the security force at-
tacked the PLAN-fighters on April,

he allowed the South African ermy to
leave their bases for a large attack on
SWAPO fighters.

1.2 After the confinement of the
South African troops to their bases
for 60 hours, we find they had al-
ready left the bases before the des-
ignated 06h00 on April 29. They
started to fire allert shots during the
whole night of the 28th. The UNTAG
forces in the north will agree with
me. From 02h00 on the moming of
the 29th their Casspirs and Rattels
were on the road.

Why do they have to monitor the

Will SWAPO fighters do the same

stay at their police stations? Is it
because because there is no room for
all of them? The whoke KOEVOET

keep such a big police force? Is is just
to distribute DTA pamflets, helping
in their campaign as they did on
April 29 at Othingo, on the west of
Oshakati and elsewhere?

South Africa is doing all this to vio-

that all the people wish to be free and
that their desire for freedom is rooted

in the soul of every one of us. A
people long subjectedto foreighh ”
domination, however, does not al-
ways find it casy to translate that
wish into action. Under arbitrary rule,
people are apt to become lethargic,
theis senses are dulled. Fear becomes
the dominant force in their lives; fear
of breaking the colonial and apart-
heid laws.

SWAPO, who led the struggle for
freedom, broke through this apathy
and fear. We gave active expression
to the universal longing to be free.

Our leaders strenghten the peoples’
faith in themselves, and cncourgac
them to take part in the freedom
struggle.

I am convinced the unity of the
Namibians outweigh those who di-
vide us.

Forward with the struggle.

THE tong yearned-for Namibian
after more than 70
years of South African rule, is clearly
visible. But prospects toward a lJast-
ing peace m a future independent
Namibia, and the entire region of
southern Africa, is still miles away.
There are two major areas of concem
- the status of Walvis Bay and the
Angolan war.

Walvis Bay, Namibia's only deep
ocean-gomg port, poses a single major
threat to any post-independent gov-
emment in Namibia as long as South
Afnca continues its claim over the
port. Despite the United Nations rul-
ing that Walvis Bay is an intcgral
part of Namibia, Pretona continues
to regard and treat the nortas part and
parcel of South Afric}.

Walvis Bay is not only a vital
anchorage for imports and exports,
but provides a large military basc
and airstnp for South Afnca to con-
tinue its destabilising tactics against
the neighbounng black African states.
This will enable South Africatokcep
war away from its mainland. No
county has so far dared to launch a
direct attack on the South African
mainland while South Africa has used
illegally occupied Namubia as a spring-
board for its periodic incursions into
southem Angola.

Walvis Bay has even greater im-
plications in terms of its relationship
to a fubure independent Namibia. Since
the port is part of South Afnica, those
Namubians residing in Swakopmund
and elsewhere will need to have visas
to leave and enter the port. And a
horde of Walvis Bay residents em-
ployed at the Rossing Uranium Lid,
outside Swakopmund, will have to
periodically renew their visas to en-
ter and leave the port on their way to
and from work.

Also, the SA officials travelling by
road to Walvis will need to apply for
visas to leave and enter Namibian
territory. Walvis Bay also stands as a
potential cover for any opponents of
a new Namibian government, and
might as well provide for their base.

And the fact that Pretoria and its

nrogates might use Walvis Bay as
sagt for m sack on th

had nothing to guarantee an end to
the Angolan civil war or reduce US
aid to Unita. This can only be weighed
against the fact that it is pretty much
within the interest of the west. or the
US, to have Jonas Savimbi in power
in Angola.

The war in Angolais thus nota war
of liberation, but a struggle for power.
The US justifies its support for Unita
as a way to ‘combat Soviet expan-
sionism’’. Hence the fear exists that
a new born Namibian nation might
80 pro-cast, and in the lightof this the
“crusade against Soviet expansion-
ism""’ will continue. The misguided
belief that the Russians are bent on
‘world conquest’ has given nse to
one of the twentieth century miscon-
cepuons: whenever the third world
nations rise and make a Claim, they
they must have been told by some-
body else - if not the Americans, then
the Russians.

This limits the world in terms of
east and west, and undermines the
sovereignity of other cxisting na-
tions. Henceforth, there is nothing
that rules out the possibility that any
adversaries of anew Namibian gOv-
ermment will find a helping hand in
America and be used as instruments
to make trouble in the interests of the
west.

Zaire provides an excellent ex-
ample of western stranglehold on a
developing third world nation.

T have lived for nearly ten years. As
an emigrant I have no problem of
divided loyalites: Yugoslavia is my

first brought me into this world and
the second I have willingly chosen as
a partner for life. Perhaps my letter
should be viewed in a similar, if not
the same, light.

It makes me sad when | see how
many born Namibians do not use
their education and knowledge to
help their own country and work for
the benefit of their own people. This
makes things worse for those who
prefer to work for enemics of the
peaceful implementation of Resolu-
uon 435.

I believe every responsible resi-
dent of this country should take the
Ongoing process very senously and
uy their best to make it succeed.

This is an histoncal event, which
our children and future genesations
are going to learn about in the class-
rooms.

There are many powerful forces in
Namibia working to see the process
fail and war and suffering start again.
They are the forces which, in the
past, were never in favour of inde-
pendence, and were planning some

Atraid of liars

IN Oshiwambo there is a proverb
which says: Omufundji oku vule
omulodhi. It means a har is worse
than a witch. The saying continues: It
is better to accomodate a witch than
a lier.

Lhave been baling to understand
the proverb of my ancestors. My
question has been, why did they look
upon liars with apprehension? (1 pould
be happy if someone could give fur-
ther clarification).

For many years we have been oul-
side our beloved motherland - parted
from our parents, sisters, brothers,
friends and comrades. We havc al-
ways becn dreaming of home.

It also pasned us when we were
told that some of our relatives or
fnends penshed in the bloody 23.
year war. Therefore, we understand
what it meant when some of our
fellow compatnots were told that
their nextof kin were ‘eliminated’ by
Swapo. These lics have caused
immense damage and confusion.

Maybe our ancestors were afraid
of liars because what they said did
not only affect a limited number of
people, but the entre population. A
witch destroys only one or two poople,
and then that is the end.

When liars speaks of death, they
mean life; when they speak of de:
mocracy, they mean tyranny, justice
= injusucc, reconstruction = destruc-
tion, freedom = oppression or captiv-
ity, decolonisation = colonisation,
freedom from South Afnca = de-
pendence on South Afnca.

These are the people who nearly
destroyed the Namibia peace process
by concocting lies that Swapo com-
batanis infiltrated Namibia on Apni
1, while many of them had been in-
side already.

Lies were fabricated again when it
was reported that Swapo combatants
were moving south of the sixicenth

into Namibia - an absurd statement
indeed.

DTA and 435

ALLOW me to be an ethnicist at this
moment by introducing myself as a
Caprivian amd a proud ‘Mafwe' for that
taattez. | wish to cxpress concern about
my fellow ‘Mafwes’ who are support-
ocs of the DTA. I am prood, and do not
heaitate to mention thet the Mafwe are
people with « definite culture who
strive for good mora! norms aad codes.
Theeefor what the DTA is doing is not
-in secopdance with oer morms and val-
ton, Chat is, beating other poopie, chal-
lengiog them with dangerous woapons
ae.

_ This is aot only a crime but also
panlabable in ow tribal cours. | am
selecring to tnatences Like those which
took place ot Mekangs, Sinywebuna,

otc. | wonder what it moans when oar
respected Mafwe tribal authority toler-
ates such actons | wonder
whether the Tealises the reper-
cussions for itself.

However, let me sound a warning to
fellow Namibians, particularly the
DTAs. Just as God liberated the Leraelis
from the bondage of slavery to the
Egyptians, God is now going to liberate
His sons, the Namibians, from the yoke
of bondage from SA colonial rule.
Never mind how stubbom Pharaoh
was, the fact remains thai the Israelites
were liberated from Egypt as God de-
cided. Never mind how stubbom the
South Afncans/DTA may be, the fact
remains Namibia will be free.

I have a strong conviction that any-
one who stands in the way of God will
be drowned in the Red Sea This isa
good warning to the DTA.

Mr Martti Abtisasri and his team
represent Moses in the peace process:
“History repeats itself’.

Fellow Namibians and fellow Ca-
privians, fellow Mafwes and the DTA:
““T kanda ka i li twikiwe’': thas is, you
Cannot put the country on your bead. It
is beavy and will break your neck.

We know the DTA was totally
against the implementation of Resolu-
bon 435. We call on this organisation
ot to involve itself in the peace proc-
ess with a manner of pretence, aiming
to disrupt and cause the process to fail.
It must not come owt with dirty ticks
and strategies of using the sadicals of
the community and school dropouts to
prevent the process from being run in
the letter and spirit of 435.

Itis a good sign of ignorance to see a
person showing the ‘two-finger sign’,
shouting ‘demo’ and at the same time
beating, harassing and hindering others
from holding meeangs. It ia time the

aging them and the pupils present to
take action against teachers belonging
to Swapo. Is this what the DTA will do
when it comes to power?

On the other hand people are ques-
tioning why Swapo does not retaliate. It
has been directly involved in the proc-
css that has brought Namibia to the
present political situation, it knows and
understands what is happening and
where it is heading, and it
wrong elements like DTA and Koevoc
as lost sons. It is ready to receive and
work with both good and bad elements.
A parent socepts all its children. So let
us all come together under Swapo; jet
us avoid fighting ome another, let us
know who the real enemy is.

Finally I want to call on the Mafwe to
sec to it that poople are disciplined and
that they respect and love one another.

Why do we not experience similar
things in the Masubia arcas? Does this

Even the Bible says if someone

cheek, but what happens if they slap
that one as well? I am sure that the
answer would be to retaliate in self

avoiding them because we want peace

THE future of the country is being
shaped NOW ... don’t you want to
partake?

This question I wish to pose to all
my white compatriots who regard
Namibia as their home country and
who want their children and grand-
children to live here peacefully and
prosperously ; and to thos! who are in
the privileged position to influence
the economic and social develop-
ment of our country after independ-
ence, but who foresee darkness and
insecurity in the future.

During these past decades we have
consistently ignored or distorted
certain realities in our country (and
the press has played its major part)
until they became facts in our his-
tory. After all, the process of inde-
pendence has begun, Resolution 435
is being implemented and the Swapo
leadership and even its President,
Sam Nujoma, did return from exile.

Let us look at some aspects of the
present situation:

Election campaign and inumida-
tion: This is the first general election
in this country, and aggressive and
‘unacceptable behaviour by incited
party members can be expected. But
we are very fortunate, as the sole
country in Africa, to gain independ-
ence through the process of an extgn-
sive plan, and we cap be grate-
ful the process ti progressing
: “In spite of all predictions, the
guerrilla fighters do not practice in-
timidation at the pomt of the gun
and maintain a rather strict disci-
pline. Great respect can also be ex-
tended to Swapo for its restrained
reaction to the assassination of An-
ton Lubowski, the most provocative
incident thus far. Let us hope that the
recent increase in violence will not
escalate to an unmanag({able level.
Election result: Most parties have
resorted to an anti-Swapo election
campaign on a very low level. In-
stead of informing the clectorate of
future programmes, aims, policies
etc, they attack other parties and do
not hesitate to instill fear and hatred,
often based on lies. The shocking
incidents of April 1, and the un-
solved question of Swapo dissident
camps have put oil on the flames of
general accusations. As much as we
would like to put a finger on certain
issues and condemn certain acuons,
we should not become blind to the
fact that for the majority of Namibi-
aris Swapo is still the party of the
future. Swapo will win the election.
Will we be able to live with that? I
think we can - if we are prepared to
contribute as true Namibians.
Reconciliation: For the past few
years, Swapo has been following 4
course of reconciliauon among
Namibians.

The former struggle should not

conflict between the South African
colonial power and the Namibian
population. Not only al the biggest
political rally in Namibia, on Sunday
September 24, has Nujoma offered
reconciliation and cooperation. This
gesture was not motivated byu the
wish to gain the votes of the whites.
Swapo does not depend on these votes
to win the election. It is rather based
on the willingness to learn from the
experiences of other African coun-
tries and is guided by the aim of a
peaceful and stable future for all
Namibians.

Appeal: I would like to appeal to
all, to recognise and accept the real}-
ties, and not to be deceived by ide-

press. See, hear and think for your-
self.

Accept the offer of reconciliation

and regard the coming independence
as a challenge rather than a threat.
You can become involved at all lev-
els, and it is important everywhere. It

expectations, but also understand and
share the anticipated joy of many
Namibians about an independent

President of the DTA. Muyongo, using
the smal] amount of credibility he

” This no exaggeration to say that the
DTA is essentially a mixture of
unmixable opposites. Most leaders

Muyongo, Africa, Kashe - are not

Botha’s threat

I PERCEIVED with dismay the
threatening statement made by South
African Foreign Affairs Minister,
Roelof Botha, on his recent visit to
Windhoek to the effect that “if any-
thing unforeseen happens between
now and Namibian independence,
which violates any of the agreed
principles his government reserved
the right to take whaicver stcps it

doomed necessury’’.

1 would like to remind the colonisers
that we did not invite South Africa to
invade our beloved Namibia and
subject it to colonialism and all that
gocs with it, and their presence here
has aiways been illegal, nor did we
consent to the German fascism of
von Trotha.

We fought back tooth and nail
against these forces unul today when
the deeply yeamed-for freedom and
independence 1s about to be born.

We know South Afnca is not
committed to genuine implementa-
tion of 435, and if it was not for the
heavy burden of war, which the oc-
cupier could not sustain, then the
future of this country would stil] be
locked in chains.

If any ‘unforeseen’ happens in this
country, as Mr Botha fears, then it
wil undoubtedly be the fault of Pre-
tora. Namibians are peace loving
people who have no intenuon of
invading other nations or neighbours.

Mr Botha should restrain his forces
and cease their clandestine activi-
tics. South Africa must not attempt
to create a pretext to invade this
country to perpetuate colonialism or
insutute neo-colomalism.

It is unacceptable for the SADF or
SAP to retum to our soil under any
circumstances.

They should be restrained and
disciplined. This nation does not want
the smell of blood while striving for
peace, stability and the nght lo na-

Chief Riruako seemed to be out of

killing of irmocent people has been
common and prevalent, especially in
the north all along since the election.
Many people were robbed af gun-

A big headache

THE opporunists among Namibians
-could cause a big headache for our future
government,

It seems to me thal most white Namibi-
ans with an opportunistic nature are those
in the ‘pnvate business sector’ and blacks
are mostly former members of SWATF,
particularly 10] Battalion.

It is sad, and at the same time logical,
that some of the 101 former soldiers are
not prepared to terve their country in a
new Namibia defence force, domanding
same of mora money than they got
tha colonial regimes.
this ls ‘Logical’ to me is because if

they were not opportunists they would
have refused to jom enemy forces in the
‘first place.

What salaries were paid to our Namib-
ian heroes, Swapo Plan combatants who
fought for so long to liberate Namibians
from the oppressive South African re-
gime, including the SWATF members?
Do they feel no shame?

If they were in Romania they would
serve life sentences or be executed by
firing squad. If they think they can get
more money elsewhere, they are free lo
look for better paid jobs.

It is their democratic nght to say no.

As far as | know Namibians there are
cnough men and women who are ready at
any lime to secure our freedom, to guard
our borders and protect our peace and
defend our democracy, filled with a spirit

Fighting chiefs

were not the first to settled in the
Eastern Capnvi. The Cinef and his
elements should then be prepared for
Ins claim that he 1s the (Munitenge)

expense of his counterpart.

Chief Moraliswam has been the

case for a long tirfe. It is time, now
tbat we are independent, to ask the
Honourable President, as a neutral
person, tohelp resol ve the issue once
and for all so that both Chiefs respect
ome another and restore peace in the
region. The Chief ahould face reality
now. He knows very well how ex-
pensive the court case has been for
both Masubia and Mafwe factions.
People were forced to contnbute
because of his actions.

He obviously thought that by tak-
ing the case to court he would be the
victor. It is for these reasons I want
him to sit down and account for what
he has done. He has sown hatred and
mistrust instead of uniting the people,
as the role of chief should be. I see the
Chief now gives a clenched fist sa-
lute; as far as I witnessed, he was a
UDF and later an NPF supporter in
the pac.

It is my wish that the President
should solve this problem to help the
two chiefs to know their tribal juns-
dictions. Caprivi will not be the first
region to be demarcated, but chiefs
in other regions know their jurisdic-
tion and that is why there are no
senseless claims in other areas.

I once again appegl to the govern-
ment of the day to come up here and
show each chief where he begins and
ends so that the one cannot claim
supremacy over the other.

THE time has come for Chief Moral-
iswami to see that the border dispute
case has not been solved by the
Supreme Court and that his ancestors
were not the first to settled in the
Eastern Caprivi. The Chief and his
elements should then be prepared for
Ins claim that he is the (Munitenge)
supreme ruler, custodian and para-
mount chief in the East Caprivi at the
expense of his counterpart.

Cinef Moraliswam has been the
plaintiff in the border/chieftamsiup
case for a long tirfe. It is time, now
that we are independent, to ask the
Honourable President, as a neutral
person, to help resolve the issue once
and for all so that both Chiefs respect
one another and restore peace in the
region. The Chief ahould face reality
now. He knows very well how ex-
pensive the court case has been for
both Masubia and Mafwe factions.
People were forced to contnbute
because of his actions.

He obviously thought that by tak-
ing the case to court he would be the
victor. It is for these reasons I want
him to sit down and account for what
he has done. He has sown hatred and
mistrust instead of uniting the people,
as the role of chief should be. I see the
Chief now gives a clenched fist sa-
lute; as far as | witnessed, he was a
UDF and later an NPF supporter in
the pac’.

It is my wish that the President
should solve this problem to help the
two chiefs to know their tribal juris-
dictions. Caprivi will not be the first
region to be demarcated, but chiefs
in other regiona know their jurisdic-
tion and that is why there are no
senseless claims in other areas.

lonce again appegl to the govern-
ment of the day to come up here and
show each chief where he begins and
ends so that the one cannot claim

THE nonsense about Plan ‘gangs’ in
the north has come to my attention.
For the past weeks Plan combatants
have been deployed in the province
of cnticism by joumalists who in-
vent stones in order to supply copy
for professional vendors of political
slander un this country.

_ The matter was also brought up by
Mr Enc Biwa (NPF) in Parliament
and others who expressed concen
about the detenorating secunty situ-
ation 1n the north.

The electorate expect the Parhia-
ment to attack buming issues in the
country like education, health, un-
employment, houses etc.

Certain members of Parhament are
apparently insensitive to the fact that
Namibia is a newly-bom nation,
emerging from the debris of apart-
heid colomalism. The time for shabby
politics has gone. The time is now for
realism and people are waiting for
concrete and constructive program-
més which will assist the long down-
trodden nation in realising its hopes
and aspirations.

We are all affected when there is
lawlessness in any part of the coun-
try. As the opposition is concerned,
so is the Government. Our President
has also expressed his government’s
concem about the breakdown of law
and order and the Minister of Home
Affairs deployed extra police units
along the border.

The problem is that the situation is
not being presented in the right per-
spective in Certain quarters. What I
have learned from the people in the
affected area, is totally different to
Mr Biwa's assertion. The citizens of
the region are concermed about the
fact that Unita elements are threaten-
ing both their safety and their prop-
erty.

of suffering to achieve peace and

On forgiveness

TRY forgiving a friend who betrays
a confidence, or a co-worker who
tells lies about you. When the real
effort of forgiveness takes place, there
is nothing easy about it. Instinct urges
us to pay back in kind.
Some people are capable of heroic
effort in reconciling; others not. There
is usually a pause between the hurt
and the time when trust and love can
take root again. Forgiveness is part
of a process that begins with hurt and
ends, inits final goal, with reconcils-
ation.
It works only when we become aware
of the depths and causes of the ange!
burning in us so that we can forgive
wholeheartedly and ensure anendur-
ing peace.
Too often, we bypass forgiveness
entirely. We race from our hurt to an
arent reconciliation without tak-
ing stock of what must truly be for-
given before lasting healing can take
place. We try to get past the difficult
part too quickly,“for we have been
pro since childhood to keep
a stiff upper lip, pretend that we are
unaffected by the cruelty of others,

whether deliberate or accidental.
The ability to reconcile cannot be
Tushed. We owe if to one another to
offer time to confront our hurts, to
face our wounds head-on, to vent our
emotions. Only then can the real
healing begin.

When Jesus said ‘love your enemy’,
he meant every word of it. We never
get rid of an enemy by meeting hate
with hate; we get nd of an enemy by
getting rid of enmity.
Reconciliation depends on the situ-
alion and the people involved. In the
end, all forgivers do the same thing:
they restore self-worth to the of-
fender; they cancel a debt; they expe-
rience such peace that they lose the
urge to retaliate and live as freer
persons unshackled by the weight of
a hurt.

DURING the years of illegal occupa-
tion by South Africa, J, as a resident
of Suiderhof, had problemis with the
armed forces living next door to me.
The officer commanding the base
lived across the road from my home,
and every time a black person en-
tered my premises, he would give me
a ‘show of force’ and spit in the street
to show his resentment.

Every Friday morning one would
bear sergeant majors shouting at ‘sleg
troepe’ refusing to polish their boots
or behaving ina disorderly fashionin
public. Later a certain so-called
coloured battalion moved in and the
abuse continued. Being a keen gar-
dener in those days at six in the
moming I received a whole run-down
Oo army events for free.

Later still, we have 10-tonne trucks
hurtling down our road (Palm Street)
after someone blew up the SAWI
supermarket situated inside the base.

The main gate of the base was closed

and the side ontrance which leads
NN ee

into suburbia became the main high-
way for the amy.

Then they began to use a siren for
wakiny up the troops

and among others, the Kenyans in-
sisted on being physically fit and
faking the battalion for a run down
Palm Street every momung. Every
white-owned dog in the area went
bananas, as the troops ran past in
heavy boots.

But my story has not ended...

Two weeks ago, after a heavy Fn-
day mght, I fell into bed, and at
O5h00 my nightmare began. Out of
the base came the deep wail of a
bombing siren. I leapt from my bed
and jumped for my pants, images of
Kassinga and Ngiva pounding in my
head. 1 stumbled onto the lawn ex-
pecting chaos, but it was only the
troops being woken up.

Nothing has changed. The base is
still there, slap~bang in the middle of

suburbia. In the early momings, the

themselves up! Please, this is not

and, secondly, that the existing stu-

bean to mislead and infuse ideas of
the past colonial administrations. In
my point of view, the student! move-
ment has boon formed to foster the
interests and political ideals of their
respective political parties who are
at present on ‘death row’.

They see clearly that Nanso, which
has been a progressive student or-
ganization in the past, has won a
victorious fight against the regimo
thar illegally occupied our country, |
and which suppressed most of the
students and people of Namibia.

There was no leadership vacuum |
in Nanso. This can be proved by its
winning of the objectives it stood for.
Nanso members and supporters have
been harassed, detained and even
expelled from schools because of
their political beliefs and quest for
freedom. To say that Nanso has failed |
to serve student inferests, is mere |
bias. Nanso leadership succeeded in
mobilizing students all over the
country. It made them realize that
their interests were being suppressed
and needed to be fought for. Nanso’s
liberation standpoints, therefore, |
coincided with those of Swapo and |

|

Nantu.

Nanso could not isolate itself from
Swapo because they had common
goals to achieve. To fight a war in
disunity is to give the enemy victory
and therefore students needed to be |
linked in order to be free, get better
education, proper housing, and well-
equipped libranes, etc.

Nanso did not look for or concen-
trate on student issues alone, mainly
because the dignity of the whole naton
was undespinned by the colonial
regime. Asa student body consisting
of intellectuals, ithadtotake account |
of the socio-economic situation in °
the country. Students cannot only be
freo at school and ‘unfree’ when they

go home. Both students and their
parents needed to be liberated.
Tam assuring the leadership of the

this nation from foreign domination
and influence. I appeal to the new
organization not to create confusion
among students countrywide. We
know whose interests they represent
and promote. They must stop swim-
ming in the pool of confusion. Their |
organization was formed to counter-
act Nanso that has stood firm in
opposition to the abuse of bnman
rights.

My question to them is: if Nanso
failed to achieve what it fought for
and a leadership vacuum does exist,
then what have they achieved so far?

If you were serious, why didn’t
you form that organizatian months
ago, lo stand up against Koevoet
elements which used to disrupt les-
sons, beat up students, and erect army
bases al schools?

With regard the formation of the
TUN: it also has political motives in
their formation, which serve the same
purpose as that of the NASEM.

formed to strive for teachers’ umity
and interests but to counteract Nantu.

ing any altemative union which seeks

Being a formercombatant myself,
I feel that we are all neglected and

have fought for. We had no time to

muibia. The struggle has been long

land, others are crippled for life.

Now that the struggle for political
independence is won, why is it still

We have no chance anywhere. The
Government should seriously look
into our problem and do something
about it. We read in newspapers daily
that the enemy of peace, Unita, and
their collaborators are trying to cre-
ate conditions conducive for another
war in our country. Yet the Govermn-
meant does not want to allow all those
who are able-bodied former Plan
combatants to join the national army.
Are we ignoring the realities?

The enemy want destabilization
and poverty to take root here as has
occurred in Angola and Mozambique.
It is time to think twice and make
sure that the heroes and heroines who
fought for the liberation of this coun-
try should be at least fully integrated
into the police and national army in
order to defend the gains of the revo-
lution against enemy encroachment.

We want to see the changes for
peace and independence of our people
maintained by the loyal men and
women we now see wandering around
without jobs. Reconciliauon must
make things balance.

The Government! must see to it that
these brave men and women are
assisted by the state, oven if it means
creating a demobilization fund 20
that they can make ends meet.

Law of the knife

I WISH toexpress my feelings about
the violation of human nghts in
Namibia. At this pount I would like to
urge my fellow Namibians to respect
life more than money or property.
Many people have lost their lives
since independence. Mainly because
some people do not want to respect
the laws and constitution of the
Republic of Namibia which provides
for-the protection of life, and other
human rights.

The use of knives to kill others is the
order of the day in Namibia, espe-
cially among young people. In order
to reduce or eradicate the problem
altogether, 1 appeal to the govern-
mem to introduce laws to prohibit
the carrying of knives in public places.
The knife is as dangerous as the gun,
and there must be punishment to
ensure that knife-users are deterred.
What we have to bear in mind is that
the killing of innocent people is a
violation of human righté in terms of
our laws,

Note that the constitution says that
all human beings are bom free and
equal in dignity and rights, without
distinction of any kind, such as race,
colour, sex, language, religion,
Httoal and other opinion, national or
social origin, p » birth or offer

IS that really the question?

At one time I believed very strongly
that whoever is responsible for the
Timea of Namibia editorially, has
somne sort of death-wish. I could just
act believe thet axrybody with a sane
sind could write or allow such mb-
bish to be wriftes as appears in the
petitical columns of tho Times. I
oven went to the extent of accepting,
which I still do, that that person went
eat ofhis way to provoke the govern-
meat into against the Times’
rund of ~ thus croating a
“maentyr out of him/her. How long

the democratic government will tol-

erate being belittied and called all
so 8s of names, 1s the question in the
mands of so many Namubians, and let
me assure the Times and DTA that
they are many.

I think now that the Times is cer-
tain that there 1s no action that will be
taken: there are even times when it
revertstonaked racism in its descrip-
ton of ‘black’ African countries, while
reference to South Africa creates the
impression of a docile dog creeping
with ifs tail betwoen its logs in front
of its master. Lest 1 deviate, let me
return to the issue 1 am writing about.

The belief that whatever deliber-
ately negative remarks or unfounded

[

accusations are made against the
govemment will force it to collapse,
borders on insanity. Boasting about
bnnging down the govemment singie-
handedly with such reports shock the
imagination of any human being. Itis
with this in mind that I read of the
‘Evidence on Namibian coup’ in the
October 5 edition of the Times.
The said newspaper reports exten-
sively on evidence given by Josef
Kleynhans, who told the court that
some people tned to recruit him fora
‘coup’ against the govemment. The
concept that itis only armiescapable
of staging coups, as repeatedly said
by the Times, is s0 ridiculous, but
their attempt to create the impression

that the arms theft was only a minor
‘adventure’, is, I fee] an attempt to
downplay the seriousness of the crime.
The thieves will finally, in the cyes
of the Times, be nothing more than
‘youths in search of adventure’.

I] hate to think what would have
happened if such a theft took place in
the previous dispensation and if the
‘adventurers’ were black and not white.

This comes after weeks of specu-
lation in tho same newspaper as to
whether there was really a coup plot
in Namibia or not. It is interesting, to
say the least, that this newspaper
should now have a headline report on
the coup. One wonders about this
paper's sense of journalistic ethics,
for in the past couple of weeks it
decried the coup story which was
broken by The Namibian as a ‘fig-
ment’ of that paper's imagination.

Now the Times of Namibia will
probably become the champion against
the coup. It seems to be trendy for the
Times to, on the one hand, deny the
existence of a coup and on the other
to be the first to report on evidence
given about it.

Whether one calls it an intended
coup or not, is purely academic. In

fact, the academio masturbation about -
coup or no coup does not impress the
majority ofNamiblans. Lat us at
tho facts: numerous arms .were sid
len, surely not to play ‘cowboys apd
crooks’, but to cause irreparable harm.
The simwas eurely to create havocin
Namibia.

Now tho opposition papers can
call it what they want, can even give
dissertations about ‘classical’ can- -
cepts of coups, but we, the Namibi- ‘
ans, know the arms were sjolen to
disrupt our hardwon independance
and democracy.

PLEASE allow me to comment on
President Sam Nujoma's visit to
to next page
to next page

Keommanshboop on Tuesday October
23.

As always, President Nujoma, on
nis armival at the Keetmanshoop sta-
dium, captured the minds and spints
of all the people present. Especially
the schoolchildren were ecstatic as
President Nujomia passed the stand-
ing crowd to the stage.

The very first thing that struck him
was the quite obvious attitude of
pupils and teachers of the local white
schools. They were seated separately
from the pupils of the so-called black
schools.

The President immediately called
upon the pupils and the teachers of
the white schools tocome closer, and
mix with pupils of the other schools.
This call was welcomed with great
applause by the people present.

This practical gesture demonstrated
our President's seriousness with the
policy of reconciliation. He again
referred to the children as the future
leaders of Namibia. It is the pupils of
the pre-primary to secondary level
who must learn to live and play with
one another.

The speech by the President per-
sonally gave me hope for the future
and the efforts of our young govern-
ment. The optimistic manner in which
he facee his and our many challenges,
was reassuring, and we must pray for

lasting peace and stability in our
beautiful country.

Keotmanshoop on Tuesday October
23.

As always, President Nujoma, on
iis arrival at the Keetmanshoop sta-
dium, captured the minds and spirits
of all the people present. Especially
the schoolchildren were ecstatic as
President Nujomia passed the stand-
ing crowd to the stage.

The very first thing that struck him
was the quite obvious attitude of
pupils and teachers of the local white
schools. They were seated separately
from the pupils of the so-called black
schools.

The President immediately called
upon the pupils and the teachers of
the white schools tocomecloser, and
mix with pupils of the other schools.
This call was welcomed with great
applause by the people present.

This practical gesture demonstrated
our President's seriousness with the
policy of reconciliation. He again
referred to the children as the future
leaders of Namibia. It is the pupils of
the pre-primary to secondary level
who must learn to live and play with
one another.

The speech by the President per-
sonally gave me hope for the future
and the efforts of our young govem-
ment. The optimistic manner in which
he faces his and our many challenges,

“wee yeassuring, and we must pray for

lasting peace and stability in our
beautiful country.

Our President also proved that he
remains a man of the people, despite
his high position. It gave me great
joy to see how humble and down. to-
earth he is.

At the end of his address, the Mayor
tned to restore order as the school-
children became so excited. Presi-
dent Nujoma ga‘e them the rest of

ally satisfied. As I saw our lads started

f Misch 21 means ..

THERE are only « few days
left before we celcbrate the
first anniversary of our hard-
won independence. It was 12
moaths ago when the popular
ruling party. Swapo, the then
Hberation movement which
gallantly fought and defeated
the then notorious forces of
occupation at the battlefront as
well as the ballot box, adopted
the policy of national recon-
ciliation, the policy of forgive-
ness and focus on the future.

First of all, let ue examine
the significance of March 21.
The date is and will remain an
illuminating day in the Na.
mibian calendar. Illuminating
in the sense that itis the day on
which the yoke of colomalism.
which was imposed on us, was
buried for ever.

It was the day on which
dignitaries from all over the
world joined the brave sons
and daughters of this country
to witness the burial of coloni-
alism by replacing the South
Afncan flag with that of the
new Republic of Namibia.

It was a wonderful and
moving occasion, which pres-
ent and future generations will
never forget. It was a day on
which the nationalist fighters
stood hand in hand and said
‘look, our sacrifices have not
been in vain’.

As the freedom fightars were
rejoicing, those who fought
against the emergence of
democracy stood with their
hands on their heads.

Why was it necessary to adopt
the policy of national recon-
ciliatian? The movement's aims
and objectives were to liberate
this coumtry from the then forces
of colonial oppression and
establish a government founded
upon the will and participation
of the Namibian people.
uns achioved that, the

-——

colonial regime with the view
of the achievement
of democracy. With this in mind,
Swapo opted for a policy of
national reconciliation which
is humane and suitable for
Namibians.

The most striking aspect of
the policy is that it promotes
the values of equality and human
dignity. It intends to unite the
Namubian people irrespective
of colour, race, nationality or
ongin. This policy deserves
our respect.

Many have complained about

» the negative aspects of national

reconciliation but Little has been
heard about its ments

The success of the policy
depends on the performances
of those implementing it. The
ments of this policy are more
than its dements. This policy
is, in my view, meant to pro-
vide a breathing space for those
harbounng illusions about the
past colomal system to adjust
themselves to a new era of
national independence, peace,
stability and the humane ap-
proach.

As we rejoiced on March 21
last year, we were equally
womied about what we had
inhented from the then noton-
ous colonial regime in terms
of debt, unemployment and
pobtical instability (the latter
with regard to tendencies of
tnbalism and racial discnnu-
nation based on colour)

The probleniis, how are we
going lo pay the socalled debt
without economic prospenty,
and how are we going to com-
bat the already deteriorating
unemployment situation with-
out economic growth?

The government's efforts to
combat the unemployment
situation will be meaningless
unless accompanied dy the will
and voluntary participation of
the ‘haves’ of our society.

We expected the electranic
and print mediatoplay a major
role in shaping the destiny of
our people. But at the moment,
its efforts aro feeble because
we aro divided. We have just

emerged from s unique oolo-
nial system, a system in which

our people were taught to behave
in a tribalistic manner. This
evil sysiom has contaminated
the minds of some members of
our society, making it difficult
for them to adjust to the new
era of independence. The media
should be offering guidance to
our people to create for them
opportunities to rebuild their
self-respect, restore their faith
and rediscover for themselves
their human dignity. Regional
radio stations should be utl-
ised for the bene fil of people in
those regions.

Oue of the Government's
nian pnonties 1s education. It
1s the finest foundation of all
for the nation-building proc-
ess. Its also the comerstone
upon which 1a rest our surest
hopes to build our young Re-
public

As we approach the first
anniversary of independence,
we necd tn be devoted to the
cause of national building
through the process of national
reconciliation.

Fauure to implement this
posinvely will effect the con-
cept of democracy in this coun-
try.

We cannot achieve any of
these objectives unless we are
hardworking, disciplined, law-
abiding and unplement the
policy of national reconcili-
ation un 2 positive light.

Kovemyamas, 43 Kwambis and
96 Windhoskers.

by others, the frequency of the
orchestrated aftacks against
Swapo has again increased of
late.

In the light of these accusa-
tions, Swapo of Namibia
demands that Phil ya Nangoloh
produces full names, addresses
and specific areas of ongin of
the following: the female ac
livist who went to Lubango:
the commander who was met
by this activist in Lubango; the

officials from the Ministry of
Education who met the ‘de- |

tainees' in Angola; the alleged
detainees referred to above and
the names of the rest of the 625
detainees he «claimed went
missing in Swapo detention as
per the updated list.

Swapo has undertaken to
make a preliminary report about
the sacrifices made dunng the
war in terms of human lives
and hopes that the report will
be available before the end of

this year. However, the proc- »

ess of searching for missing
persons will, like in any other
war, continue for a long time
to come.

Swapo of Namibia pro-
pounded the policy of national
reconciliation aimed at bring-
ing peace, political stability
and unity among our people
which are pre-requisites for

economic development.

However, clements in this
country who are faithful to their
sponsors continue to distort the
painful episode in the dark page
of the colonial history in this
country, hus impainng this
policy. Swapo will not allow
this to continue.

In conclusion we wish to
state that should Phil ya Nan-
goloh fail to produce the infor-
mation as outlined above,
Swapo will be forced to take
the appropnate action.

know that the allocated funds
to this Ministry will not solve

Mr President, you pointed
out recently that opposition
parties should not oppose

ing, nor the governing party
defend for the sake of defeod-
ing only. We hope that our

I AM writing to advise the
Ministry of Defence not to
misuse this time of peace.

Too much of a good thing is
monotonous. Soldiers in bases
around the country have no
work to do, except continuous
manocuvres and this brings
boredom.

On many occasions soldiers
are told to attend classes but
due to boredom they go absent
without leave.

My suggestion is that the
Ministry should take advan-
tage of this, and utilise the
soldiers in bases inthese times
of peace.

It would be better if the
Ministry could provide build-
ers to show soldiers how to
construct their own barracks
and provide them with bull-
dozers and tractors to lake part
in agneultural projects.

It we keep our soldiera busy
with productive tusks as wel!
as Constructive ones, this will
give us a good reputation with
the nation.

Soldiers need to be taught
skills so that they could join
workers’ brigades with better
qualifications whenever they
leave their posts,

more they will reserve; the more
they construct, the more: they

time when Namibia needs to
marshall all its available re-
sources for development. Ef-
fective utilisation of human
resources at all levels and all
dimensions, is key to the pro-
motion of real development in
Namibia.

The time has come that a
change of attitude must take
place. Women have now for
some time realised that we have
the potential (social, economic
and political) and wisdom to
shape the future of this coun-
try. We therefore nghtfully

demand the opportunity to have |

this vajuable potential fully

tapped fur the development of |

Namibia. Machinery to enable
women of Namubia to fully
participate in the development
of our motherland must be put
in place.

Women’s participation will
change society and liberate
women. Women's struggic
must not be seen in one dimen-
gion, as simply a struggic against
men. See the many aspects of
the structural dimension (so-
cial, political, cultural and
economic).

Struggle means awareness.
Struggle means organisation
and unity. Struggle means
courage, struggle means faith
and hope. We must begin to
build these up in our small
circles and link up with one
another. Nobody can help in
this process more than women
ourselves, Let us mobilise and
organise ourselves for cystem-
atic involvement in change. Let

Your observation that our

a dogmatc approach that 1s
accompanied by a security
phobia and a serous lack of
analysis on the role of mass
Organisations in 2 post-colo-

democrat at all.

Nanso is opting for a disci-
plined working alliance with
parues who share common
programmes, objectives and
campaigns. Nanso cannot be
apolitical in a political eavi-
ronment.

Hence the need for stnilang a
balance between the need for
strengthemng the organisation's
independent base on the one
hand, and the role Nanso will
have to play wn our country’s
restructunng of the economy
and the formulatonof policies
on the other hand. Our impact
on the situation will depend on
our representation, unity and
strength on the ground.

Our most immediate task is
to mobilise and unite our stu-
denis. Majonty of our students

No white has ever becagivena
house in the not-so- well-built

j black reeidennal area and I have

never seen whiles suffer as
blacks do when i! comes to

Any white whocomesto the
region is given a house, while
blacks have to meet certain
requirements. Some single
whates live in big, rent-free
govemment houses while black
families are living in shanties
and caravans.

1 know that housing is a
national problem, but it is bad
tolet families live in the kitch-
ens of their relatives.

As far as employinent is
concemed, this goes hand-in-
land with uke availability of
houses, In Rundu houses are
reserved in case a person of
high rank is hired, while the
others do not have housing at
all. Whenover someone from

Windhock or elsewhere is
employed bere, capecially Lo
service of the government, a
house is sutomatically given
to that person, which is pot tho
case when someone from this
area is employed in Windhoek.

T know that this is done to
encourage people to accept

like people fram Windhoek are
deemed to be more important

preferably given to those

pion of tnbalism - for it ap-
pears he is unable to think

The point I would like to
make to Chief Mamuli and a
small section of the Mafwe
surrounding him is that the
cheapest colonisation method
used to colonise Namibia was
through the existence of tnbes
- the championing of one tnbe
at the expense of others so asto
smoothly pave the way for the
bantustanisaton of Namibia.

It is disappointing to learn
that Chief Mamili claims Ka-
tima Mulilo is a Mafwe area.
Capnvi knew no boundanes
even in the time of the colon:-

Why should we talk of tribal
divisions and tnbal bounda-
nies at this time? What are we
going to benefit from tribal
conflicts apart from rolling back
the progressive idea of national
reconciliation the ruling party
is keen to implement in order
to mould a healthy and pros-
perous nation?

the socalled revelation came
from Chief Mamili directly,
then he should apologise to the
Namibian nation for the in-
conveniences provoked by the
violent demonstration and the
subsequent damage to peace

The prefabricated allegation
that the recently appointed

If Chief Mamuli ts a real

Namibian of November 15
1991. 1 am requesting you to
see to it that this letter is pub-
lished in your newspaper.

Mr Perrin apparently did not
have the appreciation of the
mix of the audience I was
addressing at the Annual South-
em African Universities So-
cial Sciences Conference and
therefore misrepresented some
of what I had to Say, particu-
larly about the present state of
democracy in Namibia and a
possible onslaught on it, from
either the far nght or from
Swapo's traditional support-
ers.

My point about democracy,
which was addressed toa sec-
tion of the audience, had to do
with a linkage that certain major
Westem countries are now
insisting on, such as muln-party
democracy, human nghts and
market economy as anew type
of conditionality for giving
development aid. Elsewhere and
in our country, I have been
saying that all these require-
ments are fully in place and
functioning in Namibia, yet the
consistency and levels of aid
to our country leave much to
be desired. So much on this
point.

article entitled ‘University

What I said in my speech,
which I had stated on many

Namibian democracy 1s not
assisted with sustained and
substantial economic and fi-

constituencies such as the un-

will become disenchanted with
the Government. The gap in
social dispanties rather than
narrowing would continue
widening. In a nutshell, while
our democracy is functioning
and growing, it still remains a
fragile expenment.

Democracy and development
go hand-in-hand, but the nec-

His disappearance did not

the police did with their brother.

spoken of by many in the area
as a great loss, not only to
Namibians who knew him but
many who had heard of him.

Remember
Simbwaye
HONOUR should be given to

the former Vice President of
Swapo, Brendan Simbwaye,

who disappeared 28 years ago. —

It was late moming of March
1964 in Katima Mulilo when

the news spread into the vil- —

lages that Simbwaye was kid- —

napped at gunpoint from the
local prison by the SA Police.

He appears to be forgotten
on the political map. He fell

_ victim to the police after ad-

dressing a rally at Mapulo, today
known as Ngwezi. During the
incident, 16 people were
wounded. | :
His disappearance did not
stop the fight for freedom and
independence, but rather sharp-
ened the struggle in that area.
Thousands of Caprivians are
still asking themselves what
the police did with their brother.
Simbwaye’s death is highly
spoken of by many in the area
as a great loss, not only to
Namibians who knew him but
many who had heard of him.
While in office the SA Po-
lice showed Caprivians that the
best way to do away with an
order fighting for independ-
ence was to arrest, torture,
intimidate, and put injail those
‘who were. active in the
struggle. . |

Urging Mafwe and Masubia —

‘to unite as one in the struggle
for unity. and independence,

An open letter to
UN Secretary General
Dr Boutros Boutros Gali

IN VIEW of Namibia's sec-

my deservedly deep concer
about parts of our country still
under foreign domination.
Whiting straight to you proba-
bly reveals my ignorance re-
garding the ‘correct method’
of communicating with you.
However, deliberate depriva-
tion and annihilation during
the tragic colonial era would
justify my shortcomings. No
wonder, Namibia’s current
more than 50 per cent illiter-
acy rate. 7
Nowhere in the world, at
of Nations and subsequently
the United Nations’ existence,
were more resolutions passed,
defied, overlooked and/or for-
gotten than in the world body’s
former ‘baby’ for which it had
direct responsibility.
The long colonial years di-
lapidated both Namibia’s un-
renewable natural and human

still paying reparations to each
other after the two world wars.
Regardless of her plunder at
the expense of growth, pro-
duction, literacy and self-suf-
ficiency, Namibia has her sec-
ond anniversary of sovereignty
in debt and heavily dependent
upon imports.

Worse still, more than 90
per cent of her imported com-
modities are handled in Walvis
Bay, her only deepwater port.
Unfortunately, to our detriment,
Walvis Bay is apparently still
considered as part of South
Africa. Twelve, if not more of
Namibia’s offshore islands are
also still under South African
control, thus effectively reduc-
ing the area covered by the
country’s offshore rights by
about one-fifth.

If part of the world body’s
responsibilities is to safeguard
peace, security, self-determi-
nation of member states: and
observation of good faith and
overwhelming justice towards

all nations, then Namibia de-
serves its long-violated rights
and national integrity honoured.
I therefore, on behalf of the
Namibian people, request your
organistion to ensure that jus-
tice prevails and that Walvis
Bay and the offshore islands
are retumed to the authentic
control of the indigenous popu-
lation - the Namibian people. I
should be grateful to see the
new world order incorporating

Enemy of peace

AS a patriot and 4 democrat, I

would like to respond to Dr
Petrus J Krige’s letter which
appeared in The Namibian on
April 3.

First I would like to make it
clear that the policy of na-
tional reconciliation was unani-
mously declared asa national
policy and not only the Presi-

tions have to make sure that
the policy goes deep into the
roots of this country and is
clearly understood by all citi-
zens. This is the task of every
Namibian. For that matter, Dr
Knige is not only against the
prevailing atmosphere in this
country, but he is also against
its independence, as such he is
an enemy of peace and justice.

There is no one in this coun-
try who would support his line,
except perhaps a few friends
who are suffering from the same
disease.

When we talk about recon-
ciliation, we mean business,
and we do not judge people by
colour, sex, political affiliation,

ideological differences or be-
liefs.

Tt is untrue to say that the

Government of Namibia does
not allow judges and sport
participants from South Af-
rica while it allows imports
from the same country. J think
you are joking, and are obvi-
ously not a Namibian. If you
are, then you don’t need to get
a job, but re-orientation and
attend lectures to familiarise
yourself with what is happen”
- ing in Namibia. You must be
the first ignorant intellectual
in Namibia.

Regarding culture, the Gov-
ernment of Namibia is ademo-
cratic one, and I can assure you
that it doesn’t limit rights and

freedoms as you maintain. .

Everyone has the nght to en-
joy his or her cultural heritage
provided that this is in keeping
with article 19 of the
Constitution of Namibia.

I think that his theory is
misleading, if not inciting hatred
among Namibians. Since you
are a doctor in musicology,
maybe you need a medical
doctor to cure you of the dis-
ease called a superiority com-
plex and your racism. It is a
pity we still have people in this
country who are anti-progress

dent or Government institu- .

and anti-nation building.

Are you also saying that
Namibians are unable to do
administrative work? And are
you saying that Namubians
should not be appointed to high
positions? I believe that all
Namibians, irrespective of
colour, should have equal
opportunities and be able to
run state machinery. Don’t
underestimate the abilities of
Namibian people, sir. It is not
only foreigners who can do
these jobs.

Neither should you insult our
national anthem. ‘Freedom
fight” has no undesirable or
negative connotations. It is only
your ignorant, anti-democratic
and racist sentiments. Who are
the Namibians who live inside
the country who don't share
the same sentiment regarding
this? You are an autocrat and
cannot talk on behalf of demo-
crats. Who gave you the man-
date to do so?

J don’t think you can pre-
tend not to know why Swapo
opted for the armed struggle.
There is hardly anyone, even
non-citizens of this country,
who do not know, this.

‘You are not only against —

Swapo as the ruling y party, but

also against the Namibian .

people. You do not even honour
people who sacnificed their lives
for the cause of this country
and now you want to be given
a job, probably as a director,
because you think you are the
best and only musicologist in
this country.

I feel sorry for you sir. Be-

sides musicology, you appear
to be totally empty politically.
National reconciliation is our
policy and if you don’t like it
you should go to a place where
there is no peace and justice,
since you want the policy tobe
reversed. Think twice, sir, and
learn from your mistakes.

were song. For auuty years
thes fought against colonial
rule under BAPPA, the Ba-
sibian Peoples Party. After a
long and paurful struggle,
Basibia finally won its inde-
pendence. Now the Basibian
people were free to shape their
own nation.

“Now we can be just like
other nations in Africa”, sad
some of the people. “Oh no”,
said others, “we must learn
from our brothers and sisters.
We will follow their successes
and avoid their mistakes”

Basibia adopted a
constitution that was admired
all over the world because it
made Basibia a tue democ-
Tacy.

BAPPA swept to victory in
Basibia’s first election as an
independent nation because
it promused to live up to is
name as a people's party. Its
election posters said ‘United
We Stand, Divided We Fall’
and ‘Build a New Basibia tor
all Bas:bians’.

The ieader of BAPPA be-
came the first President of
Basibia He ioved the people
of Basia and was much loved
by them.

“We are all Basibians to-
gether’, he said. “Every man,
woman and child in this na-
tion is my family, and I will
not rest while any of my people
are suffering”.

“That is fine”, said some of
the members of BAPPA, “but
now we must talk about our
salaries. To keep the peace.
we have promised all the gov-
eminent employees who were
hired before independence that
their salaries will not be re-
duced. So we must pay our-
selves at least as much as
they are getting, or perhaps
even more”

“No”, said the President
“those people were robbing
our country. Why should we
follow in their footsteps? Be-
cause we work for the gov-
emument, we are given houses
to live in while many of our
people are homeless. The state
even gives us pensions and
medical aid. We will pay
ourselves modest suanes. And
Thave State House to live mn
and a government car to travel
in - I will be well taken care
of. My salary must be the
lowest of all”.

“But, Comrade President’,
the others cried, “you cin't
do that. You are the father of
the nation. Surely your salary
must be the highest. No leader
of any other country would
do such a thing”.

‘And the President replied
“You say that | am the father
of our nation - what father
would eat while his children
go hungry? A true leader does
not separate himself from his
people. Let Basibia be differ-
ent. Letus set an example for

President's advisors came to
talk to him adout Cars for the
government. “Of course,
Benz's’. they sad “The Ba-
sibian people would lke to
see us urcars that wili swt out

“No”, said the President, “T
do not think so. We willnecd
transport, but we must save
as much money as possible
for developing our nation. No
one working in this govem-
mentis going to drive a fancy
car”

“But Comrade President”,
they said, “all the highest
government officials before
independence drove expen-
sive cars. And so do Heads of
State all over the world!”

“Yes”, said the President
“but we will be different. We
will set an example. A truce
leader does not separate
himself from the people. You
must remember that most of
the people of Basibia cannot
afford a car at all. Find us
some uexpensive cars that
will get us where we need lo
go""

“Now, Commie President”.
said the advisors, “we need to

“But why?”, said the Presi-

we can gather to do our work?""

“Yes”, they said, “but itis
old and dingy and we will be
crowded there. We want a
fancy room with anew carpet

“No”, said the President, ‘T

nation has a home to l.ve in
Until thatday, we must get by

The next day tne President's
advisors were back again.
“Comrade President”. they
said, “we will have to make
many trips to other counmes.
We must share ideas and
discuss issues and make agree-
ments with the people of other

“This is true”. said the Presi-
dent, “we must do some Tav-

think of savug money. None
of my ministers will fly first
class, and we will always stay
in the cheapest hotels”.

“But Comrade President,
they said, a government min-
ister must travel in style. You
would not want your Mmunis-
ters to be crowded and un-
comfortable”

And the President said “how
can you talk about being
crowded and uncomfortable
when have seen some of our
people living in the single
quarters, 10 and 20 people
sleeping in one tny room,
every night of their lives?”

“But what about you, com-
rade President?”, they said,
“you must have your own
plane forefficiency and s¢cu-

rity”.
“Very well, bul we must
find the’smallest, cheapest,

simplest plane that can take
me where [ need to go. A true

leader does not separate
himpelf from the people. We
are going to setanexample to
the world”.

It was not long before a
delegation came from Parlia-
ment to visit the President.
“Comrade President’, they
said, “this cannot continue.
We are Basibia’s leaders. We
fought for independence and
now we deserve our reward”.

“Yes”, said the President.
“but we did not fight alone
Would any of us be here in
goverment today if we had
not had the support of our
people? All Basbians deserve
the reward of a new Basibia
where all can prosper”.

“But, comrade President”,
they said, “no other country
in the warld operates this way.
We will be the laughing stock
of Afnca”.

“No”, sad the President, “7
think you are going to be sur-
prised”.

And it was not long before
anew spint came to Basibid -
aspiritof giving and sharing.
Government muinistnes held
compeutons to see which ones
could save the most money
Somme of the civil servants who
had been hired before inde-
pendence were so embarrassed
about their high salanes that
they asked for salary culs.
Even private citizens sold ther
fancy cars because it was so
unfashionable to be seen in
them.

And the government spent
money on health care and
education and Literacy train-
ing and development projects
and social secunty payments
for the old and unemployed.
It was not long before the
standard of living of every
single person in Basibia had
nsen. No one was hungry.
Children were healthier.
Everyone in Basibia had a
home, and almost everyone
could read. Ard the govern-
menthad been so careful with
its money tha: Basibia was
not dependent on foreign aid.
Basibia was truly free.

The President was respected
and admired more than any
other leader in any county in
the history of the world All
over Basibia people said “A
true leader does not separate
himself from the people”. They
voted for BAPPA again and
again, and Basibia remained
peaceful and prosperous.

And soon Basibia was fa-

ever dared 10 be so different.
Visitors came streaming in

this remarkable place. New
investors were attracted 10
Basibia because tl was SO
unique. People in every land
recognised the wisdom of the
President of Basibia and he
was awarded many honours
(which he always accepted in
the name of al! Basibians).

Basibians had once said
“We must be like all other
counties”. Now people in

othercountries said “we want
to be like Basibia”

And thatis how one small

The jet outcry

IT has never been part of my
culture to engage myself in
public debates which are being
over-emphasised for polincal
gain.

In the face of the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an R80 mil-
hon jet for the Government
and officials of the Republic
of Namubia, I was faced with
several questions which I could
not help to answer.

I fully concur with the fact
thatour county faces numer-
ous problems, some short tem
and others long term. Take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane

Now the question is whether
it ig tue that those ‘Muyon-
gos’ who presuppose that the
R8O million could have been
better spent uf used for tehet
programmes are more sensi-
tive to the realities in Na-
mibia? If so, how far back
have they (Muyongos) been
so critical about the way in
which taxpayers’ money has
been spent for the purchase
of things such as Casspirs and
Mirages by their regime, the
former interim government?

Or, docs Muyongo wantus
to believe that the money mus-
used on the purchase of war
material at the ume of their
rule was ‘ess than R80 mil-
lion? And was it not taxpay-
ers’ money?

This country has inhented
a debt which i has to repay
due to the misuse of funds
and the cnminal war which
was impesed on our people.
Again, does Muyongo want
us to accept that the drought
and other social evils in our
country today are new hap-
penings? T assume not.

Unemployment. hunger, [0
mention but a few, are the
legacy of the past history ot
the country. Even at the tume
of successive colonial regimes.
the problems were there.

As these problems did not
prevent them (the Muyongos)
from purchasing wanton war
matenals which ran to bil-
ons of Rands which this
country is left to repay today,
likewise, should these pre-
vent the legitimate govern:
ment from purchasing a plane
which will enable the Presi-
dent and other Government
officials to maintain contacts
with the outside world for the
benefit of the people of this
country?

ONCE upon a time there was
a country in Africacalled Ba-
sibia. Basibia had a small
population. Moet of its people
were poor in terms of money
but rich in spirit

For many years Basibia was
tuled by a colonia: power.
The officials in the colonial
government paid themselves
high salaries while the people
starved, robbing Basibia of
its wealth for their own bene-
fit. But the people of Basibia
were strong. For many years
they fought against colonial
mule under BAPPA, the Ba-
sibian Peoples Party. After a
long and painful struggle,

Basibia finally won its inde-~
pendence. Now the Basibian |

people were free to shape their
own nation.

‘Now we can be just like
other nations in Africa”, said
some of the people. “Ob no”,
said others, “we must lea
from our brothers and sisters.
We will follow their successes
and avoid their mistakes”.

Basibia adopted a
constitution that was admired
all over the world because it
made Basibia a true democ-

racy.

BAPPA swept to victory in
Basibia’s first election as an
independent nation because
it promised to live up to its
name as a people's party. Its
eléction posters said ‘United
We Stand, Divided We Fall’
and ‘Build a New Basibia for
all Basibians’.

The leader of BAPPA be-
came the first President of
Basibia. He loved the people
of Basibia and was much loved
by them.

“We are all Basibians to-
gether”, be said. “Every man,
woman and child in this na-
tion is my family, and I will
not rest while any of my people
are suffering”.

“That ia fine”, said some of
the members of BAPPA, ‘“‘but
now we nrust talk about our
salaries. To keep the peace,
we have promised all the gov-

their salaries will not be re-
duced. So we must pay our-
selves at least as ofuch as
they are getting, or perhaps
even more”.

“No”, said the President
“those people were robbing
our country. Why should we
follow in their footsteps? Be-
cause we work for the gov-
emment, we are given houses
to live in while many of our
people are homeless. The state
even gives us pensions and
medical aid. We will pay
ourselves modest salaries. And

The next day some of the
President’s advisors came to”
talk to him about cars for the -
government. “Of course,
Benz's”, they said. “The Ba-
sibian people would like to
see usin cars that will suit our
status as leaders”.

“No”, said the President, “I
do not think so. We will need
transport, but we must save
as much money as possible
for developing our nation. No
one working in this govern-
ment is going to drive a fancy

_ car”.

‘But Comrade President”,
they aid, “all the highest
government officials before
independence drove expen-
sive cars. And so do Heads of
State all over the world!”

“Yes”, said the President
“but we will be different. We
will set an example. A true
leader does not separate
himself from the people. You
must remember that most of
the peopk of Basibia cannot
afford a car at all. Find us
some inexpensive cars that
will get us where we need to

t is Surprising that
Government and pectin
the Office Of the Prime Min,
ister is Prepared to Mislead
Public opinion by appointing
someone tO investigate the
acquisition of lang by only
three people and especially
in the Communal areas. That
office being responsible for
the implementation of the Land»

- recommenda-
tons could have Started there

to solve the national issue of
land.

Itis also surprising that the
Government, whenever it talks
of the legal or rightful acqui-
sition of land, only concen-
trates on communal land. Let
it be stated here categorically
Clearly that we the Namibian
people, and especially those
of us who laboriously fought
to return back our stolen land,
did so for the whole of Na-
mibia including the socalled
commercial farmland.

Lasting peace and stability

in this country could only come
if equitable distribution of land
is done now and not later. The
question of senior officials
acquiring land only demon-
Strates to us that people are
hungry for land. Lf senior of-
ficials have the means of us-
ing their official positions to
acquire the land, the mass of
our people who on numerous
occasions have demonstrated
publicly to have the land ques-
tion settled, may one day take
up arms to revoke the present
Status quo as far as land own-
ership is concerned.

It is hurtful to note that the
land price is artificially made
to be exhorbitantly high to
benefit those who forcefully
took control of our people
and ownership of our land.
Once cannot accept that in
Windhoek it is practically im-
possible to buy a piece of
land to build a dwelling.

So, Mr Prime Minister, we
the silent majority, who fought
for the liberation of this coun-
try and suffered imprisonment
and detention for the libera-
tion of this country, who dem-
onstrated fearlessly in the
streets of Windhoek, Katu-
tura, mines, schools, did so to
ensure that Namibia is free.
We who voted the Swapo gov-
emment to power want our
land NOW. We expect you
urgently to implement the Land

On Earth Summit

THE Earth Summit presently
being held in Brazil once again
highlights the precarious po-
sition Planet Earth finds itself
in because of the short-sighted,
profit-oriented exploitation of
its natural resources.

It also shows that if man
has learned anything from
history, it is the fact that man
never seems to learn from
history. ,

Take, for instance, the av-
erage cilizen’s matter-of-fact

‘attitude towards the environ-
ment, especially in our still
developing, relatively non-
industrialised county.

t is Surprising that th

e

Government and specially
the Office Of the Prime Min-
ister is Prepared to Mislead
Public opinion by appointing
someone tO investigate the
acquisition of land by only
three people and especially
in the communal!

areas. That
office being responsible for
the imp ion of the Land ”
Conference, recommenda-

tions could have started there
to solve the national issue of
land.

Itis also surprising that the
Government, whenever it talks
of the legal or rightful acqui-
sition of land, only concen-
trates on communal land. Let
it be stated here categorically
Clearly that we the Namibian
people, and especially those
of us who laboriously fought
to return back our stolen land,
did so for the whole of Na-
mibia including the socalled
commercial farmland.

Lasting peace and stability

in this country could only come
if equitable distribution of land
is done now and not later. The
question of senior officials
acquiring land only demon-
Strates to us that people are
hungry for land. If senior of-
ficials have the means of us-
ing their official positions to
acquire the land, the mass of
our people who on numerous
occasions have demonstrated
publicly to have the land ques-
tion settled, may one day take
up arms to revoke the present
status quo as far as land own-
ership is concerned.

It is hurtful to note that the
land price is artificially made
to be exhorbitantly high to
benefit those who forcefully
took control of our people
and ownership of our land.
Once cannot accept that in
Windhoek it is practically im-
possible to buy a piece of
land to build a dwelling.

So, Mr Prime Minister, we
the silent majority, who fought
for the liberation of this coun-
try and suffered imprisonment
and detention for the libera-
tion of this country, who dem-
onstrated fearlessly in the
streets of Windhoek, Katu-
tura, mines, schools, did so to
ensure that Namibia is free.
We who voted the Swapo gov-
emment to power want our
land NOW. We expect you
urgently to implement the Land

tions. The more delays to the

Namibians from all walks
of life will commemorate
Heroes Day on August 26.

Significantly this is a
remarkable day, because of
the nature of the liberation
activities which occurred on
that day between the indige-
nous brave sons and daugh-
ters of this country and the
then colonial forces al
Ongulumbashe in the north-
erm part of the country.

Those liberation activities
germinated or brought about
national independence and
cemocracy. It has been a
bitter struggle as it was
depicted by the Honourable
Minister and veteran politi-
cian Andimba Toivo ya
Toivo during his political
trial.

It was a life or death situ-
ation but despite that, the

Namibian people undez their :

then vanguard liberation

movement Swapo fought

heroically and pledged or

vowed not to stop their

struggle until all colonial

evils were burned and genu-

ine national independence

19931022,19931022,peace,Peace.19931022_page_1.txt,1_2,"~ On civil service

IT is only when we the
civil servants are well-
informed about the eth-
ics and responsibilities
of civil servants that the
majority of staff mem-
bers will be able to ad-
just themselves to the
ongoing restructural
problem.

It is obvious that the
progress, pf any country.
is seriotisly jeopardised
when the civil servants
are not well informed
about the ethics and re-
sponsibilities of civil
servanis.

In his address during
the workshop organised
for permanent sceerctar-
ics at Gross Barmen, the
Right Honourable Prime
Minister, Comrade Hage
Geingob, emphasised the
following:

* gucucs al govern-
ment offices: .

* the need for perma-
Nenlsecretarics lO assess
people's feelings about
the quality of service they
receive,

* terminally buresu-
cratic offices:

*sense of commilment
and dedication;

* the use of the tel-
ephone:

* recruitment, promo-
tion and responsibility
and accountability.

IL is my personal un- |
derstanding that civil '
servants must be acutely
conscious of the crucial
role they play in achicv-
ing government abjec-
tives of bringing about
peace, orderly develop-
ment and prosperity to
the country. Obviously,
we can only achieve this
through the act of creat-
ing awareness and
through individual com-
mitment.

All the remarks made
by the Prime Minister
reflect the daily occur-
rence in individual
ministeries. Some per-
manent secretaries de-
cide to be exclusive and
some are so dismissive
that they are no longer in
contact with theirstaffin
particular and the public
in general. Some resort
to so much secrecy that
they are nol aware as (0

Strength of otherremain:
ing members of the chain,

According to EM
. Debrah, ‘civil servants
are highly respected per-
sons who at all times are
supposed to exhibit a
sense of dedication to
their duties and absolute
respect far the rules’.

Civil servants are the
ambassadors and mirrors
trom which the image
and wishes and aspira-
tions of the government
and the people of the
country are reflected.

[tis imperative to say
that the concept of being
exclusive, indecisive,
dismussive, rude and 1m-
polite is incompatible
with democracy, peace,
progress and a healthy
working relationship.

when the civil servants
are not well informed
about the ethics and re-

servants,
_In his address during
thé workshop organised

for permanent secretar-

ies at Gross Barmen, the
Right Honourable Prime
Minister, Comrade Hage
Geingob, emphasised the
following:

* the need for perma-

* recruilment, promo-

It is my personal un-
derstanding that civil
servants must be acutely
conscious of the crucial
role they play in achicv-
ing government objec-
tives of bringing about
peace, orderly develop-
ment and prosperity to
the country. Obviously,
we can only achieve this
through the act of creat-
ing awareness and
through individual com-
mitment.

All the remarks made
by the Prime Minister
reflect the daily occur-
rence in individual
ministeries. Some per-
manent secretaries de-
cide to be exclusive and
some are so dismissive
that they are no longer in

the ethics and responsi-
bilities that govern our
profession or calling.

It is against this beck-
ground that I congratu-
late the office of the
Prime Minister and the
Prime Minister himself
for having organised and
addressed the recent in-
formative and educa-
tional workshop for per-
manent secretaries. This
was democracy in action.

The Prime Minister
spoke of assessment of
public feelings. This is
an important point, but
how can one assess peo-
ple’s feelings if one has
adopted the concept of
being exclusive? It ts
through socialisauion that
one can effectively as-
sess the staff and the gen-
cral public's feelings to-
wards one's perform-
ances.

As civil servants we
should always remember
that whatcver we say, do,
and whatever our objec:
tives arc, it is the civil
service unity of action
which make up the chain
of development and if
one of the staff break
down in terms of think-
ing, initiative and crea-
tivity, in spite of the
strength of other remain-
ing members of the chain,
this chain will cease to
be active.

According to E M
Debrah, ‘civil servants
are highly respected per-
sons who at all umes are
supposed to exhidil a:
sense of dedication to
their duties and absolute
respect for the rules’.

Civil servants are the
ambassadors and mirrors
from which the image
and wishes and aspira-
tions of the government
and the people of the
country are reflected.

[1 is imperative to say
that the concept of being
exclusive, indecisive,
dismissive, rude and im-
polite is incompatible
with democracy, peace,

and a healthy
working relationship.
There is therefore, a need
for more seminars simi-
lar to that held at Gross
Barmen. We have much
to lear in terms of indi-
vidual commitment, a-
oa ity, reaponsibil-
ve and loyalty.

appeared in The
Namibian issue of April

Incidents of tribal
clashes in Kenya were
first reported in 1991.
Since then, the Govern-
meat has mobilised ail
its resources to address
the problem. Asaresult,
peace has been restored
in nearty all areas which
were affected.

threatened to erase the
traditional Kenyan love
for one another had as al

has managed bo push them

HAVE you been to the Alte Feste
lately? If you have, then there is no
need to convince you that the claim of
Caro! Kotze made in The Windhoek
Advertiser of January 13 about ‘empty
rooms’ is aproduct of ill imagination.
If the colleague knew what a museum
is all about, her capectations could
have been different.

According to the International
Council of Muscums: *A museumis a
non-profit making, permanent insti-

tution in the service of society and its °

development, and open to the public,
which acquires, conserves, researches,
communicates and cahibits, for pur-
pose of study, cducation and enjoy-
ment, material evidence of people
and their environment’.

Therefore, a muscum is a cultural
institution of national significance
whose goals reach far beyond mere
the entertaining of tourists. And after
all, Ms Carol Kotze has no mandate to
speak for the tourist, or docs she feel
like a tourist in her own country?

THE President hay recently been at-
tacked in the media tor visiting Nigena
and above all for mv :ting General Sani
Abacha to visit Namibia. Those who
criticived this action have every nght to
exercise their freedom of speech. How-
ever, J find the reasons they advanced
in condemning the President's acuons
to be invalid, profoundly immature. ir-
rational and highly misleading. Also
these critics manifest a dangerous len-
dency of intolerance which is not healthy
for the survival of democracy.
Whenever there is a conflict or dis-
pute it is better to attempt to solve it
through peaceful means, starting with
dialogue. President Nujoma is very
much conversant with this principle.

Therefore, when Dr Buthelezi ob- agg

structed peace in South Africa he talked
to him: in the same vein he extended an
invitation t@ Dr Savimbi of Unita to
come to Windhoek to discuss the prob-
lems and peace in Angola. Also, when
South Africa was a panah state, pro-
gressive people all over the world, m-
cluding victims of its policies, remained
ready to talk and listen. It is therefore
wrong to condemn statesmen who ini-
tiate dialogue with General Abacha.
The fact that President Nuyoma is
willing to associate with him should
not be seen as demonstrauve of support
for the latter’s regime: it should instead
be seen as an attempt to help Nigeria

return to democracy.

tsolating General Abacha when he is
willing to assoc tale with democrats will
only encourage him to contunue violal-
ing peace in Nigena and strengthen his

undemocranc methods of govesmment.

Mr Groth, if people are saying that some of those
who tortured people in Angola and Zambia are in
parliament, what about those who were against
Swapo? Some of them commanded squads to kill
Swapo members, but they are also in the Partia-
ment, police, defence force and some even hold the
higher ranks.

Talking about spies.

Mr Groth, I, who am writing this letter, was a
Swapo member during the struggle. I was beaten
many times and shot at with rubber bullets. They
really did send spies to Swapo camps.

I was approached by a certain cop at that time a
lieutenant but now holding a higher rank. He
wanted me to betray my fellow members by pre-
tending that I also wanted to go into exile. I was to
fetch him the day the people would leave so that
they could capture them. I refused. I could not do
that to my fellow Namibians.

He came to me again and this time he wanted me
to goto Angola, gain information, escape and come
back to tell them the plans, where the camps were
and many things I can’t mention. I still refused and
after that 1 was watched like hell.

Mr Groth, there is a fot you don’t know. Start
writing a book about the other side, things mustn't
be seen from one side only. Only both sides can
clean the wounds.

Swapo won the war and they didn’t take revenge.

they asked for peace, fogiveness and to
Teconcile. Is that too much to ask?

When people came back from exile they were
full of bitterness and hatred and wanted revenge,
but the President told them not to go ahead but to
forgive even though we remember and will never
forget.

If you want toknow about those who disappeared
and were tortured by Swapo, why should the DTA
not do the same? Let both sides do the same. It is
ota one-sided story.

will accept the destruc-
tton of 65 per cent? Or

Sufficient for Mr

What Mr Hamman
and some members of

are proposing that new

Namibians ever being
able to share in the ac-
commodation imdustry
of their own country in
an cnurcpeneurial way.
They are effectively pro-
posing that no home-
stead in the north of Na-
mibia should be able to
offer accommodation to
tourists. They are effec-
lively proposing that no
resident of, say, Rundu
or Otjimbingwe should
employ the facilities at
her or his disposal to of-
fer accommodation
commercially. They are
effectively proposing
that no Namibian with-
out access to capital re-

are demanding that the

ratify this discrimination
against its own citizens.

We call upon the me-
dia and the public to rec-
ognise that this issue is
not simply a matter of a
disagreement with HAN

those who benefited -

the outdated Ordinance
20 of 1973. If members

Nam Needs To Develop 4
National Consciousness (

NATIONAL consciousness transforms the pre
political, societal and cultural system and we have ,
the power and right to make of it what we Wish 4
Such a major understanding can only be realised in,
an atmosphere where people are convinced of the -
truth and it is inherent in their stand, ,

The exploitative attitude of Colonisers has !
throughout history resulted in nothing Sinis-
ter than mere cultural or geographical fusion at
worst, or language bastardisation at best. It ig true
that the history of weaker nations are Shaped by
those of larger nations. On the other hand,
weaker nations continue to be exploited and subse.
quently many independent African Nations fail to
attain real independence. The most important
weapon for this is our mind. People are becoming
more and more conscious of the self.

National Consciousness and its Spread in Namibia
has to work against a number of factors. Firstly,
there are the traditional complexities and then the
emptiness of the native’s past.

As Fanon puts it, “The consciousness of the self
is not the closing of a door to communication”,
National consciousness, which is not nationalism,
is the only thing that will give us an international
dimension.

Namibia must unite to foster peace and h
in our country. We should not divide because of
our differences, but appreciate them and build og
the diversity of our culture. Our youth especially
Should accept their responsibility towards each othy

wrongs of the colonial era. This will only prove a

model in this regard.

When the UN Resolution 435 was about to the implemented,
with the demand that both South Africa and Swapo should first
release their captives, Garoeb went quickly to Lubango, gath-
ered the detainees from the different dungeons and threatened
that if they would reveal that they were detained by Swapo,
Swapo would deal with them in Namibia. At the same occasion
he “promised” them that they would carry the stigma of being
called South African spies for the rest of their lives.

Last year when some Namibians had started to organise
themselves into BWS to bring into the open the dark side of our
independence struggle. Garoeb called upon Swapo members
country wide to prepare for “civil war”.

In life Garoeb had carried a lot of secret information crucial
to BWS work. It seems he has gone to his grave with this
information locked up in his heart. For the sake of history, BWS
is eagerly interested to hear what Garocb had said about the
whole detainee saga during his last days of life. BWS had
expected that he might invite some of the Lubango dungeon
Survivors to his sick bed but this seems not to have happened.

We all know that it was a gross political blunder and sheer
shonisightedness when last year Garoeb tried to publicly belittle
the Council of Churches in Namibia. It was really moving to see
that during the funeral service his body was consecrated and
committed back to dust by the man he once so scornfully
characterised as a“‘non-entity”. However, in the contextof truth,
reconciliation and peace, Garoeb had left us with a very impor-
tant theological question: “What will you do if I tell you that 1
had killed your brother?” He asked this question last year when
he was addressing the striking workers in Okahandja. In es-

Nation

Hence, we are faced with the ques.
bon of our nextstep .. how are we to
nd our continent of this bloodshed?
Firstly, the perception of govern-
ance on the part of our current lead-
ers has to be amended. It 1s sad to
note that there are only a few of
our current leaders who show genu-
Ine intentions of making a positive

improvement tw the Irving condi-
bons of their own people. Because
instead of changing the traditional
tunes of politics in Afinca, they are
seemingly happy to continue with
the status quo,

When considering the new age of
leaders one 1. continuously reminded
of Kabila of the Democratic Repub-
Ix of Congo. Shortly after over-
throwing Mobuto Sese Seko. Kabila
was seen as the man of polucal
change and modemisation im the
former Zarre but | had great reserve
about his capabilities.

Kabila has shown that my con-
cems were not without foundabon
since his current refusal to allow the
United Natons invesugation into
the mass killings of Rwandan refu-
gees makes one question his claim
of innocence. When caung such ex-
amples I maantain my stance that the
role of leaders in Afnca needs to be
redefined at all cost.

Furthermore, we are faced with
people such as Arap Moi of Kenya
and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe
who have made it clear thet they will

not easily hand over power to some -
one ebe. This is absard after bow:
these men have nun ther respectrve
countnes for more than s.atecn years.

San: Abacha of Nigena, despite
hav ing overthrown a legaimate gov-
ernment, and taking power through
mulitary coup, 1s apparently try mg to
install ademocraticalty elected gov-
ernment in Srerra Leone. Is that not
what we call double standards of the
highest order? On top of that we
have the OAU and United Nations -
two bodies that continue to play
double standards.

Based on thts analysis Africa can
only be saved by the democratic
elecuon imo power of people with
integrity, vision, Cammutment and
dedication to the cause.

As Africans we musi to look for
what we do not have, Le. peace,
tranquillity and economic empow-
erment, and then continue to stnve
for these admirable qualities in our
society.

I started this paper by saying Nujoma should go
and not have a third term. Why? The regime that I
have descnbed here is HIS. He is the President! He
has the power to change through dismissal, effec-
uve reshuffling of his cabinet, caforcemen of
policy, maintaining political serutiny of his politi-
cal employees (the Ministers, Deputies, PSs etc).
He had almost eight years to prove that he is not
only from Kahao, but from each part of the coun-
try. That instead of constructing a tarred road to his
own homestead, he coulc have constructed one to
Hosea Kutako's homestead as a gesture of revols-

Why?

In simpke terms. Swapo
has for the past cight ycars
that it has been in poltucal
power in Namibia, done
nothing but emulate all the
evils of the past apartheid
regimes. Tt has instituted
one of the most corrupt
systems of self cnnchment
by political leaders and
their close friends and
relatives, [thad created an
elite system whereby a
small clique denves all the
benefits atthe detment of
the deprived. poverty
stncken population, [thas
insttuted tnbalism of the
most naked kind in the
civil service and
parastatals.

The Swapo-govern-
ment has squandered our
resources by the mishan-
dling of the national
budget as was again re-
cently pointed out by the
Auditor General. It is ap-
parent that the Swapo
government ts just not in-
terested in maintaining

any fiscal or monetary
discipline.

fied people being ap-
pointed to responsible
positions merely on the
basis of their ethnic and
tibal ongin. The govern
ment ts using legal means
to achieve illegal ends It
is thus clear that the ac-
tions of the present
Swapo leadership have
deviated drastically from
the capectauions of the
masses of our people

That brings us to the
crucial questions at us

WHAT IS TO BE

That is the question that
was asked by Lenin when

enough but when our
Masters left we barri-
caded ourselves and from
within we sought to pur-
sue everyone so that all
arguments must cease and
that all people must speak
with one voice.”

Fellow Namibians, itis
a sad reality that the
Swapo government that

who were in exile have
barricaded themselves
woth all the wealth that
Namibia has and today
while the mayority of
Namubtans are faced with
poverty, many of them
have become million-
aires. Yes, there will be
those of you who, while
reading this letter will say,
can this guy not be happy
for once on Independence
Day?

Brothers and sisters.
my conscience dictates to
me that I cannot be happy
and celebrate our inde-
pendence while:

* The majority of our peo-
ple are suffering under
severe poverty.

* The Government has
failed in addressing the
ever increasing rate of un-
employment.

* The Swapo Party has be-
wayed history by amending
the constitution for a third
term for Nujoma. The
Swapo Party has shown that

they are not fit to govern this

country.

* The Swapo government
despite the search for na-
tional reconciliation is

promoting one tribe
above the others.
How then, brothers and

sisters, can one celebrate
independence if this re-
mains the status quo? .

feady as a nation to take
stock of the mistakes of
the past, so that we can
enter the future with con-
fidence. This is so be-
cause those of us who
spearheaded the hbera-
uon struggle to this logt-
cal conclusion are nol
necessarily the heroes.
but I believe those who
laid the foundation are
real heroes.

Namibians and the cur-
rent Swapo government
have not yet mamied one
another. The truth is this
lies in the fact that what
Namibians want and what
Swapo can offer are two
different things. At the 9th
independence celebra-
tions Namibians must
start with a soul searching
exercise. Indeed we must
ask ourselves whether
Swapo is sull fit to rule
this country and if not
what is the alternative?

It is sad, however, that
many of us remain igno-
rant of what is really hap-
pening in this country. As
long as we benefit from
the system we are per-
suading everybody to say
that everything is okay.

However, the reality is

that everything is not

TAKING a close hook at what is lappening in our

point out two things that are ineveasingly becom-

TOLERANCE - Namibians have seen a growing
number of cases where politiciana;especially in the
ruling party, have exhibited insolerance. This hap-
pened after the launch of the new. party and there
was namecalling, especially abowsBen Ulenga.

Launching a political party issin line with the
Namibian Constitution and doeanot infringe on any

CENSORSHIP - The fact thasState-owned me-

is a great deal of censorship in theemedia. The state
is footing their bill, but as a taxpayer I want to be

The tribal animosity that the Linyant: tribal

The amalgamation of tribes into a single Mafwe

Masubia and the Mafwe which later spilled over to
the Mayeyi and saw a spat of roadblocks, beatings.

of the day. Conversely, others are
normally expected to be tolerant of
those views provided such views
are expressed within the limits of
the right of freedom of

However, after having read
Frederick B Philander’s letterin The
Namibian of 23 December 1999

Philander’s Faux Pas

wards the wishes of the people and
a total disregard for the democratic
process in Namibia.

Philander claims that the major-
ity of the Oshiwambo-speaking
people voted Swapo back into
power. Ido not think it is necessary
to go into the modalities of such a
wayward claim. It would be more
appropriate to say however, that
Swapo scored eleven out of the
thirteen regions of Namibia. That
means from north to south, east to
west. Some of us in the analytic
community read this to mean that
development under a Swapo gov-
ernment has taken place
countrywide and the people thus
voted for a continuance of this de-
velopment. invaluable pesce and

tranquilsty. Ics quite obvious that
cither Philander tums ablindcyeto

rhese realities or he has difficulty in

reconciling with these facts.
Philander further goes on to fc-
veal his ignorance and confusion
with the term one-party state and
the constitutional amendment im
favour of the presidential third term.
Let me enlighten him. A one-party
state is characterised by the consu-
tutional provision that only one
political party 1s recognised by the
state. Namibia being a democratic
country, this is highly inconceiv-
able. Philander expressing Ppesst-
mistic views obviously does not
have faith in the Namibian democ-
racy. As for the amendment to the

constitution, the constauuion has

been legally and democratically
amended to allow for a third term
Nothing more than that.

Like 1 said earher, Philander’ s

views would have gone unnoticed
had he not resorted to insulting the Namibians ine

electorate who voted Swapo into
power. In his failure to understand
why people have spoken the way
they did, he suggests that the masses
“mustreally have their heads ¢xam-

nation” and suggests grass 1eno-
rance. These insults are clearly a
flagrant abuse of his night to free:

Lastly an important clement of 2
modern representauve government
will always be the process of elec-
tions. Elections have been closely
tied to the growth and development
of arepresemtanc and democrauic
government. Thus itis generally
eld to be the single most important

National Assembly and listed all efforts
by the Namibian Government and the
intemational community in achieving
peace in Angola. The role played by

didn’t know that Unita leader Jonas
Savimbi was invited to Namibia in Auv-

The excuse that banditry activities are

to the FAA is rather misleading. Unita’s
banditry activities were reinforced by
the fact that Unita is on the Tun, cut off
from logistical and other supplies which
resulted in sheer desperation and

Previously the Rehoboth Mission was infiubited by

because they were involved with conflicts with Jan

The Basters never took land or anything clse from

Dax

ble statements made one Alfred

- a Swapo backbencher inthe Neseee Ceenas
This man is clearly showing his ignorance that the
Swapo reconciliation policy is a total sham meant to
deceive the people of Namibia. Itis also very clear to us
that he has been appointed to launch a racist attack
against the Rehoboth Basters.

I shall hereby try and sketch to Mr Dax how the Baster
people have come to ultimately settle in the Rehoboth of
today. | am not sure whether Mr Dax can grasp to
historical facts that I am going to present but that is not
my problem. During the start of the 19th century both the
Nama and the Baster people who sprang from each
other’s loins, felt the bad administration of the Cape
colonial government. Together they decided to look for
salvation across the Orange River and outside the reach
of the Cape colonial government. There were many
streams ever moving northwards but the main ones were
the name groups of Witboot, Afrikaner and others.
Together with them were the Basters under Kaptein
Hermanus van Wyk heading northwards while another
group split eastwards towards Rietfontein.

It was a journey over many years of forbearances and
suffering without food or water at times until Van Wyk’s
trek finally reached the Rhenish Mission of Brother
Kleinschmidt at Rehoboth. With proper agreements
between the Baster Kaptcin and the Hereros. the domi-
that time in the region, the Basters settled

What Really Happened In Rehoboth

impossible for small clans like the Swastbools and
others to have occupied an area the size of the original
Rehoboth gebiet. In spite of this, Kaptein Van Wyk
Made agreements with Samuel Maherero, Jan Jonker
Afrikaner and others to ensure the peaceful coexistence
of the Basters with their immediate tighbours.

All that the history shows is that Van Wyk made
Streruous efforts to make peace among the warring
faction of Witbooi, Maherero and Afrikaner. He wanted
above all else to have peace in this land and security for
his people. He set up an administration in Rehoboth
based on the organised ownership of Land and property
and law and order. His administration started to delimit
and regulate the sizes of farms. The citizens santed
naming their farms and title deeds were issued.

Since the Basters were of mixed origin, all of them
spoke mainly German, Dutch and Nama. And they
freety gave names they preferred to their farms. Many
preferred to give Nama names to their farms, names that
still exist today.

Now along comes Alfred Dax claiming that farms
with Nama names belong to Damaras. Damaras never
owned any piece of land in the Rehoboth gebtet.

What we know from history is that Damaras initially
lived on the western hills of Rehodoth. This was a shanty
town built with rusted pieces of tin. The Damara inhab-
itants of that part of Rehoboth town were mainly domes-
lic servants and farm workers.

They admittedly lived in very adverse social and
economic conditions. To address this eyesore, the
Rehoboth government under Kaptein Hans Diergaardt
built a new and modern suburb on the castem part of
Rehoboth and freely gave it to the inhabitants of the
shantytown.

Today that modem suburb under the very same Alfred
Stephanus Dax is fast becoming another shantytown.

1 AM a Kavanyo student

What is the use of just sit-

peacefully and quietly,

are collaborating with

complication of ballot papers as al-

observation people are altributing it
to illiteracy.

ALLOW me to clear up
and elaborate on what has

' become a controversial

hot potato on the name

, change for Capnvi.

Who was Caprivi to
start with? Caprivt was a
German Cuptain in the
German colonial army.
Shortly betore they were
defeated by the British
and the South Afmean
forees, Captain Capris
and his torces quickls
decided in that short ses-
sion held at then Head-

Caprivi in addition of the
existing Henge name

This was decided ta
have a two-fold connota-
tion. Firstly as a landmark
that Clearly states that the
entire Namibia was calo-
mised by Germany. See:
ondly. wath the name
Capri intact it was casy

for Germany to reclaim
the entire country back
after the war and review
allsigned agreements with
Britain.

A name change for
Caprivi is long overdue;
Was supposed to change
subsequently after rade-
pendenee in 1990.
Change is inevitable and
we cannotrun away from
It

Why the name change?

SThe scrambling of

that most Afneans come

where the name Capnvi
never existed, hence it
only came alive in 1915.

they publicly apologise to the nation or publicly ac-

ALLOW me to clear up
and elaborate on what has
become a controversial
hot potato on the name
change for Caprivi.

Who was Caprivi to
start with? Caprivi was a
German Captain in the
German colonial army.
Shortly before they were
defeated by the British
and the South African
forces, Captain Caprivi
and his forces quickly
decided in that short ses-
sion held at their Head-
quarters Schuckmanns-
burg to name the region
Caprivi in addition of the
existing Itenge name.

This was decided to
have a two-fold connota-
tion. Firstly as a landmark
that clearly states that the
entire Namibia was colo-
nised by Germany. Sec-
ondly, with the name
Caprivi intact it was easy

for Germany to reclaim
the entire country back
after the war and review
all signed agreements with
Britain.

A name change for
Caprivi is long overdue;
it was supposed to change
subsequently after inde-
pendence in 1990.
Change is inevitable and
we cannot run away from
ut.

Why the name change?

1. The name Caprivi has
no cultural link with
Namibians residing inthe
region viz Masubias.
Mafwes, Mayeyis and the
San people.

2. Caprivicuts short the
history of Mafwes,
Masubias, Mayeyis and
the San people whose his-
tory goes as farasthe 15th
century.

3.The scrambling of
African history teaches us

that most Afncans come
from the Great Lakes
where the name Caprivi
Never existed, hence it
only came alive in 1915.
(Note: languages existed
before the name Caprivi.)

4.The name Caprivi dis-
criminates hence all
Namibians residing there
cannot be called
Caprivian, only those born
there.(note: Capnivi is not
a language but a German
name.)

5.The name Caprivi
promotes rebellion and
secessionism since it im-
plies

Namibians who hail
from that region are from
a country other than the
Land of the Brave.

6. Caprivi assumes the
status of a different coun-
try, hence it ts the only
Namubian region that sub-
jugates citizens, viz, we

don't have Omahekeans,

Ohangwenians nor
Khomasians, why
Caprivians?

7.Caprivi should not be
compared to cities and
towns like Windhoek and
Tsumeb which explicitly
teflect their origin by
name. It is subject to
change without vote or
referendum to suit the pre-
vailing changes and de-
velopment, so as to bring

‘Answer For Terrible Tragedy

THE attack ontwo Ameni-
can cities is a terrorist act
of such magnitude that a
few words of condolence
hardly seem appropmiate.
Nevertheless, our hearts
gooutto the families who
have lost loved ones, and
the American people as a
whole.

This terrible act of ter-
ror highlights a number
of issues, which are dis-
turbing for all of us living
in the free world. Whilst
we can never justify ter-
ror as a way of solving
problems, the signs point-
ing to this tragedy have
been around for some
time, and this tragedy
could have been avoided.

The premature fingers
of suspicion are pointing
at Osama Bin Laden as
the perpetrating master-
mind. There are many
other groups around the
world who have no love
for the American admin-
istration, and these acts
could have been com-
mitted by any of anumber
of organisations, and not
all of them of Arabic ori-
gin.

It must not be forgot-
ten that Osama Bin Laden

is acreation of American
foreign policy, if there is
such an animal. Bin
Laden was aided and
abetted by America when
he was a member of the
Mujehadin when they
were fighting the Soviet
forces in Afghanistan.
At the time he was act-
ing in the interest of
America, and being sup-
plied with weaponry.
Saddam Hussein is an-
other American creation
(read Schwarzkopf's au-
tobiography) who was
supplied with weapons
and the very biological
gases that they now want
toconfiscate. These were
used by Iraq against Iran
in the eight year war be-
tween these two coun-
tries. The same gases
were used in Vietnam. It
must be remembered that
both Bin-Laden and
Saddam Hussein are Ar-
abs, and America has
made it patently clear
that it has no interest in
the Arab world, its peo-
ple, or its progress.
America acts only inits
own interest, hence the
military base in Qatar.
It is unashamedly pro-

Israel (read pro-Jew-
ish).

No country, which
postures as a world
power, can broker peace
in the Middle East if it
displays the kind of bias
that America does in the
that region. There was a
time when we merely
suspected that there was
this pro-Israeli bias, now
everyone on the street
knows it, and what does
that do for the integrity of
American diplomacy in
the world?

The Middle East con-
flict could have been re-
solved many years ago if
America had not been a
biased peace broker, but
the Jewish influence in
Congress and American
society generally, made
that impossible. Also,
American foreign policy
is not something that ts
clearly defined. It is, in
fact, and ad hoc arrange-
ment, which flirts with
the devil at the best of
times. The results are
now clear to see. Puni-
tive strikes against the
perpetrators will also
achieve very little.

Everything that has

tragically come to pass
over the last few days is
symptomatic of the man-
ner in which the Ameri-
can administration goes
about its business.

It is sad and tragic that
innocent Americans
have had to pay sodearly
for an administration,
which has let them and
the world down so badly.
Itis also indicative of the
fact that world powers
no longer stand on prin-
ciple when dealing with
issues. Instead compro-
mise is the standard and
ethics and morality is
being so rapidly eroded
that we no longer stand
up for our rights as equal
occupants of the planet.
America would do well
to look at why it was
targeted in this terrible
act of terrorism. It can
ensure that this never
happens again, and I
hope that its energies will
be used in the areas
where they matter most.
My condolences to all
affected by this terrible
tragedy.

PLEASE allow me space
in your highly esteemed
Paper to comment on
Amenca’s New War. lam
very concerned about re-
ports that people are flee-
ing Afghanistan in the
wake of fears of a possi-
ble US attacks on alleged
terrorist bases.

Following the attacks
on Amenican interests in
New York and Washing-
ton it is not surprising
that the US propaganda
machinery made this the
worst-ever Story reported
so far in America. The US
media did not give acom-
plete and in depth cover-
age when innocents peo-
ple where massacred by
US forces in Vietnam or
in the Gulf War to name
but a few.

It is sad that innocent
people died in this attacks
but I just wonder whether
the lives of Americans are

THE NAMIBIAN

America Must Not Wage War

worth more than the lives
of Afghans, Sudanese, Vi-
etnamese and other states
where people have been
attacked by US forces.
American presidents
should have remembered
that “what goes around
comes around”. Is it not
always innocent people
who die when “big” men
are fighting? Just like
those who are going to die
when Afghanistan is at-
tacked? The world should
wake up to the realities at
hand. The US itself was
labelled a terrorist state in
the past and it is exactly
what they are.
Remember what hap-
pened with Patrice
Lumumba and the war of
the Bay of Pigs in Cuba?

They are using Pakistan
and the sympathy of other
countries to launch a full-
scale attack on a sover-
eign country.

I just wonder where the
sympathy of the world
was when innocent peo-
ple died in missile attacks
by US forces on the order
of former US President
Bill Clinton in Sudan af-
ter the bombing of the US
embassy in Kenya and
elsewhere? It shows the
hypocrisy of these coun-
tnes that are supporting
the United States in this
new war. One should also
look at the hypocnsy of
the Pakistan ruler who
came to power by over-
throwing the former gov-
ernment and its leader. He

is buying face with the
USA and its allies at the
expense of his own peo-
ple.

This new war is a rev-
elation that the United
States is an aggressive
state and retaliation will
not stop but intensify ter-
rorist activities against the
US.

How can there be peace
in the world if only a few
countries are living in
complete wealth at the
expense of the rest of the
world? I'm really ques-
tioning this new war idea.
What makes US intelli-
gence sure that these at-
tacks have been master-
minded by Saudi exile,
Osama Bin Laden? There
are many suspects in this

case, just to name a few
countries that showed an
anti US stance such as
Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Cuba,
Palestine and many oth-
ers.

The US has failed for
more than four years to
arrest Bin Laden, a clear
sign of the weakness of
the US security, intelli-
gence and defence organs
against international ter-
rorism. I really think that
they are abusing the sym-
pathy of the world to at-
tack a sovereign state if
Bin Laden is not handed
over.

The attacks on the Pen-
tagon and the twin tow-
ers of the World Trade
Center is a clear indica-
tion that the attacks were

aimed at what is repre-
sented by these buildings
rather than the innocent
victims. Itisa known fact
that the Pentagon repre-
sents the military power
of the US and that the
World Trade Center rep-
resents globalization,
capitalism, colonialism
and other negative vices
which is still repressing

I do not support killing of innocent people whoever
commits such acts, whether they be fanatics or Ameri-

keep aneyeon the foreign policy of theircountry. If they
see that the policy is wrong they must make it known to
their government that it is wrong. If they keep quiet than
they agree to what America is doing in foreign countries
or they will continue to perish in such attacks.

The US will investigate this attack and dispatch
missiles accordingly to those supposed to be responsi-

extremists will react again.

Revenge is not for human beings to take, revenge is
reserved for God. Since afterevery act of revenge more
innocent civilians will die. After all this who will be the

since they kill innocent civilians.

THE 11th September 2001 was not just a bad day for
America, but a very sad day for me, personally, and my
entire family. This is the day, we lost our dearest and
beloved father, Tate Joel Shikongo. May his soul rest in
peace and enter heaven. At any rate, this is what this very
terrible and fateful day also means to me.
Now, just what makes anybody decide to commit such
horrific deeds of terrorism against the mighty nation on
earth today or against anyone else for that matter? Was it
arevenge for the evil deeds that America has been doing all
over the world to others or was it just some act of mindless
terrorism by some mad dogs out of nowhere?. Either way,
what was clear is that the acts of terrorism committed in
America recently are certainly so hard to justify ... letalone
to be condoned by any human being with a mind, soul and
heart!. surely would like to join the rest of the sympathetic
world and give my sincere condolences to all the American
families and individuals who lost their innocent loved
ones. Any right thinking human would do exactly that,
except those who feel that America has been living in the
fool's paradise for far too long. By all means, my hearts
goes out to the victims of those human tragedies in America,
just like it does for the many poor victims of oppression,
_ diseases, wars, poverty and hunger, etc everywhere in
various parts of the world. I would therefore like to urge
here for America to look into the mirror, and see the real
image of themselves. Terrorism is the same, whether
committed by an individual or a government. Amongst
others, the real problems which America will now have to
solve is their often racist. arrogant, hypocritical practices

and double standards in the world: This may just turn to be’: -

ALLOW me to express
my view on the recent at-
tack on America. Like
many others tn the world
1 was surprised and
shocked by the news. Na-
tions around the world
have already gone through
such painful experiences.

America is well known
for supporting state ter-
rorism and for its mass
killing of other nations.
As a growing African
child I could not help no-
tice the nightmares of war.
I have seen a lot - from
Vietnam to Nicaragua. The
USA was a major sup-
porter of the apartheid
South African govern-
ment, which killed, bumed
to death and buried alive
my people. Nosingle mas-
sage of condolence was
sent from America; instead
they went on calling us
terrorists.

1 don’t support terror-
ism, but we should not
forget that Washington
regards some groups of
people fighting for their

Top Post

as the calibre of leading the
ew and better dimension. I
tin my deepest conviction
e Ilonga, a technocrat, with
leadership qualities, and
take, with a good political
the ideal candidate.

Tonga has an approach and
that has gained him great

fundamental rights or
freedoms as terrorists.
Once they called our
President, Sam Nujoma,
who is now ruling a praps-
ful country, a terrorist.

The word terrorist be-
came the right termtocall
any person or organisa-
tion determined to resist
or retaliate against atroci-
ties committed by the
world. If the Americans
really want peace in the
Middle East, why don’t
they withdraw all their
troops and go home? All
America ts doing in the
Middle East is oil exploi-
tation, creating confusion
and hatred among the Ar-
abs and Muslims.

Yes, you are a free so-
ciety. Don’t you think that
freedom is needed in all
parts of the world? I think
itis high time for the
Americans to learn from
their many, many mis-
takes and find a better so-
lution to problems be-
tween themselves and the
Arab world. When I look
at New York today, it can-
not be compared to Beirut
in the 80s were almost
every building was
brought down and many
families perished or dis-
placed. America sup-
ported Israel's aim to kill
and eliminate all people
in Lebanon. What did they
achieve? They supplied
both Iraq, Iran with weap-
ons to kill each other,

killed innocent Libyans,
Iraqis. failed in Somalia
and next, it will be Af-
ghanistan.

The collapse of the
Twin Towers in New
York has a bad impact on
world’s economy for
those who currently ben-
efit from it. The fact is
that New York Stock Ex-
change does not benefit
men in the mountains who
equally deserve to live in
a civilized free society in
countnes their own like
anyone else in the world.
The value of freedom and
peace is much more im-
portant tous than the value
of money.

If the American Dollar
becomes useless on the
market Angola will prob:
ably be happy because it
will use its currency prop-
erly again, the Kwanza has
lost marked value due to
criminals trading and us;,
false tbasieal
market.

My advice to Amerid
cans is that they refrain
from a military solution
and think first before stnk-
ing a poor nation. Today
we have learned a lessor
how the loss of human life
is equally painful for the
rich, poor, strong or weak.
| sympathise with those
who lost their family
members and loved ones.

sent from America; instead
they went on calling us
terrorists.

I don’t support terror-
ism, but we should not
forget that Washington
regards some groups of
people fighting for their

jew and better dimension. |

e Honga, atechnocrat, with
leadership qualities, and
take, with a good political
the ideal candidate.

Jonga has an approach and
that has gained him great
roughout the years. Com-

fundamental rights or
freedoms as terrorists.
Once they called our
President. Sam Nujoma,
whois now ruling a peace-
ful country, a terrorist.

The word terrorist be-
came the right term tocall
any person or organisa-
tion determined to resist
or retaliate against atroci-
ties committed by the
world. if the Americans
really want peace in the
Middle East, why don’t
they withdraw all their
troops and go home? All
America is doing in the
Middle East is oil exploi-
tation, creating confusion
and hatred among the Ar-
abs and Muslims.

Yes, you are a free so-
ciety. Don tyou think that
freedom is needed in all
parts of the world? I think
ois high time for the
Amencans to learn from
their many, many mis-
takes and find a better so-
lution to problems be-
tween themselves and the
Arab world. When I look
at New York today, itcan-
not be compared to Beirut
in the 80s were almost
every building was
brought down and many
families penshed or dis-
placed. America sup-
poried Israel's aim to kill
and eliminate all people
in Lebanon. What did they
achieve? They supplicd
both Iraq, Iran with weap-
ons to kill each other,

killed innocent Libyans,
Iraqis. failed in Somalia
and next, it will be Af-
ghanistan.

The collapse of the
Twin Towers in New
York has a bad impact on
world’s cconomy for
those who currently ben-
efit trom it. The fact is
that New York Stock Ex-
change does not benef
men inthe mountains who
equally deserve to live in
acivilized free society in
countnes their own like
anyone else in the world.
The value of freedom and
peace 1s much more im-
portant to us than the value
of money.

If the Amencan Dollar
becomes useless on the
market Angola will prob:
ably be happy because it
will use its currency prop-
erly again, the Kwanza has
lost marked value duc to
criminals trading and us-
ing US dollars on the black
market.

My advice to Ameri!
cans is that they refrain
from a military solution
and think first before stnik-
ing a poor nation. Today
we have learned a lesson
how the loss of human life
is equally painful for the
nich, poor. strong or weak.
1 sympathise with those
who lost their family
members and loved ones.

ALLOW me to express my views in your esteemed
Newspaper. They are in connection with the ongoing
confusion of the Angolan situation with the main news
topic in the international political arena, namely the fight
against terrorism.

[ take this opportunity also to express my condolences
to the American people for the loss of lives on the 11 of
September events.

It is clear by now that the terms terrorist and terronsm
have to be redefined and a consensus to be reached
amongst all that belong to the human race. The way ahead
is challenging but also highly rewarding. Basic justice
and a dignified human life for every inhabitant of the
earth are at stake here. The concerns about state terronsm
should be given the necessary attention. For instance,
enforced disappearance and arbitrary killings of citizens
committed by state authonties should be considered as
acts of state terrorism. A typical example of such as state
in Africa is Angola.

The longest, bloodiest. and most destructive and largely
ignored conflict in Africa 1s being stayed in the beautiful
landscapes, hills and savannahs of Angola. I will refrain
from diving deep into the causes of the civil war that rages
for decades now, for they have been exhaustively cov-
ered. | am going to stick to crucial facts to refresh the
memory of those in oblivion, who still fantasise in giving
to the Angolan ruling party tree hand to continue dect-
mating the Angolan population and plundering the natu-
ral resources. For those, a little piece of advice: forget it.
Or at Jeast, think reasonably all over again. Here are the
facts:

- The MPLA did start the civil war fin 1975;

- The MPLA did cheat the general elections in 1993
and initiated the civil war II;

- The MPLA violated the peace accord of Lusaka 1994

by resuming military operations aimed at total destruc-
tion of Unita (its old sweet dream , by the way).

The MPLA leadership, who successfully metamor-
phosed from demagogic communism to venal capital-
ism, never had the guts, stomach and neither the slightest
desire in the distant past and now to face real opposition
parties. Why? The answer is quite simple: the Angolan
Cake is so awesome, astonishing and magical that it will
constitute a sacrilege to share it with someone else other
than the top few people of the ruling party. Thus the
current tragedy. In this regard the intemational commu-
hity, especially the Western countries that continue to
milk the proverbial wealth of Angola has done very little.
As a result the majonty of Angolan population live in
abject and sordid poverty contrasting, very painfully,
with the unashamed opulent life style of few ruling party
individuals and army generals.

Calling Unita and Dr Savimbi terrorists? And what
about the atrocities committed by the Angolan army
forces, security. the police, and many other paramilitary
organisations underthe patronage and implicit support of
the unqualified and non-elected president JES? Is this not
considered state terronsm?

Can you imagine the number of deaths caused by the
constitutional, military, law and security enforcement
agencies lawlessness. of the so-called Angolan goverm-
ment? Do you have any idea of the death toll caused by
hunger and starvation, lack of health services, uncontrol-
lable banditry and even lack of potable water including in
the capital Luanda itself, derived from the chronic eco-
nomic mismanagement, blatant incompetence, rampant
corruption, nepotism, of the so-called Angolan govern-
ment?

in mind that that the peace we are enjoying today
came as a struggle which needs to be promoted in
every aspect. This also includes the renaming of the
Caprivi region to something with a Namibian iden-

PLEASE allow me to express my support for the
Swakopmund Town Council decision torename some
streets in the coastal city. | believe that it is time for
us Namibians to have our identity spelled out in the
names that best describe our cultures, including our
Namibian heroes wherever they are.

Why should we have German names used in our
country while many of our people who liberated this
country are not acknowledged. How will we learn
about the likes of Brendan Simbwaye, Peter
Mweshihange and many others who sacrificed their
lives for the independence of this country.

THE international campaign against
terrorism should also target Zionism.
We in the Palestine Support Commit-
tee (Namibia) believe that the Zionist
tulers of Israel are not interested in
peace in the Middle East.

Zionism is inherently an aggressive
and expansionist movement. Zionism
uses the dependence of American im-
perialism on oil to its own advantage
and therefore countries with the po-
groms against the Palestinian people.
Israel is a sub-imperialist outpost for
American interests. For American im-
perialism, ot! is more valuable than
Arab blood. That is why we say: No
blood for oil!

The ordinary men and women of
Israel are not our enemies, but the
Zionist rulers certainly are guilty of
crimes against humanity. All Jewish
people are not Zionists. It is a fabrica-

tion to equate anti-Semitism with anti-.

Zionism because Arabs are also
Semites.

The rulers of the world have a selec-

FOR those of us fortunate to be living our lives a
considerable distance away from the war in Af-
ghanistan, there is a certain irony present in the
vents of the past week. Plainly pul, is it possible
ustify the creation of peace by going to war?
“here must be casualties in any war no matter the
vcautions taken to minimise collateral damage,
und the inevitable loss of life.

There is talk of a humanitarian catastrophe of
immense proportions because of the fallout from
hostilities combined with the ravages of a crip-
pling drought in Afghanistan. There are sugges-
tions that food drops will not adequately address
the situation. Women and children are being
maimed in these punitive strikes despite denials by
the US, and the western world seems united that
this is the way to fight terrorism.

The barbarity of the Middle Ages ts with us right
now, except that death and destruction is being
dispensed at the press of a button in the clinical
surrounds of control-rooms thousands of miles
away. If Osama Bin Laden was the real target, then
real soldiers, with real courage should have been
sent tohis lair, toseek him out. There would hardly
have been any collateral damage or civilian casu-
alties. But America has no longer got the nerve for
real combat. Instead it conducts war games with
‘play-stations’.

Waging war is no way to fight terrorism! Bomb-
ing civilians and then trying to win their support
with food parcels is anything but civilized in
anyone’s language! If the total cost of the hard-
ware, the munitions and the personnel committed
to the conflict were quantified, then much more
would have been achieved by spending that kind
of money on programmes to win the minds and
hearts of the Muslim world in a tangible and
meaningful way.

At the moment the Muslim world is being in-
censed to the point that the gains the US are hoping
to make, will be transformed into even more anti-
American sentiments. We have seen how these
simmering feelings of alienation have manifested
themselves on 11 September, 2001.

The world does not need more of the same, and
the present American campaign will merely re-
duce Afghanistan to rubble. The result will then
be that they (USA) will fund reconstruction un-
der a government of their liking, until new feel-
ings of alienation lead to yet another generation
of hostilities, because the US listens to no one but
itself.

Like the Roman Empire, the USA will, indeed,
must. implode as a world power. because of its
outward-looking tendencies. Finding fault outside
its boundaries, failing to engage in any introspec-
tion, and gradually moving towards a society ham-
strung by curbs on the very freedoms that its
claims to champion, will lead to its own destruc-
tion. The signs are already there.

The problem is that America does not see itself
to blame for anything in the world to-day. Its
people, despite a reasonably powerful media, are
largely ignorant of what is done in their name and
in their interests, and the administration, with its
bullying and arrogant attitude, sees itself as the
kings of the world, unchallenged by anyone since
the demise of the Soviet Union, as the balancing
power in the world.

1 do not wish any harm to the American people,

existence in a world gradually falling under the

what it brings upon itself, and therein lies the pity.

We are committed to providing wider access to quality educational

solicit their fate with the
Ministry of Basic Edu-
cation, Sport and Cul-
ture since 1996 but again
nothing could be
achieved. Ag of late, re-
newed efforts were
launched with the Per-
manent Secretary's of-
fice but it seems to me
that this office is either
nonfunctional or those
within it turn a blind eye
to this sensitive case.
What is so difficult about
it? Why is the office of
the Permanent Secre-
tary not solving this im-
tating concern?

Please comrades, let
us come out in the open

boldly and explain to the
nation the reasons for not
being forthcoming. I per-
sonally challenge the PS
of the Ministry of Basic
Education or anybody
acting on her behalf it
she might be out of the
country at present, totell
the nation why this issue
is sll unresolved after a
period of 5 years.
Could the PS also tell
the nation why her of-
fice fails to respond to
letters forwarded to her
office? Do we really have
to tum to industrial ac-
tions and demonstrations
in order to solve prob-
tems? This is not a good
thing for the image of
the Education Ministry
and the country in gen-
eral. How cana Ministry
take more than 6 weeks
to respond to corre-
spondence? The manag-
ers sent a letter to the PS

‘on 5 September 2001.

After a waiting period of
4 weeks a telephone in-
quiry was made about
the letter. Officers within
this office promised to
look into the case and

come back. Up to now
no ane came back to tell
whether the letter is be-
ing attended to. Various
follow-up calls were
made to the office of the
PS response on the letter
but unfortunately no-
body could shed light on
this letter. They ac-
knowledged the receipt
thereof. God alone
knows why they don’t
respond. What kind of
treatment ts that? Let us
please hear the response
from the PS that the con-
cerned group could find
their peace of mind or
seek further audience
and assistance with those
agencies/institutions that
would be in a better po-
sition to help them get-
ting their rightful share
of the Wascom cake. |
am very glad I was
briefed about this way of
doing things in Govern-
ment. As a labour advi-
sor. | will not rest until
justice has been done to

NAMIBIAN COLLEGE OF OPEN LEARNING

perception. Why is it that
the Taliban and Muslims in
Saudi Arabia, for instance,
interpret the Q’ran so dif-
ferently? Is it merely fun-
damentalism building upits
own head of steam on the
one haad, and Arab hedon-
ism built upon oil wealth
on the other, or is there
more out there that we
should be aware of?
Why are some nations

ple and their Administra-
tion, it is the psyche of the
nation that gives cause for
concern. In discussion

box does litte to change
the status quo. Many
American friends and col-
leagues understand and
share the concerns of those
living outside the borders
of the USA, but are power-
less to do anything con-
structive. Big Brother is
invasive and insidious!!!
There is abnutal streak in
the psyche of the Ameri-
can people. The USA might
be the moet powerful world
power on the planet to-day,
but it is not the most civi-
lised! It still practices capi-
tal punishment and ex-

ecutes human beings in the
most horrendous and bi-
Zarre ways devised by so-
called modem man. From
passing thousands of volts
of electricity through the
buman body to lethal injec-
tions, and all in the name of
justice, must rank as the
ctuellest indictment of civi-
lised norms and standards!
The American peopte have
come to believe that this is
how one exacts justice!
They tum it into aspectacte
by watching it on closed
circuit television in true
Hollywoodian fashion!
Can anything else be more
bizarre, or more bnitalis-
ing? Yes, watching Afghan
women and children scat-
ter for their lives while
American bombs rain
down, is more bizarre and
brutal!!
Nottotalk of weapons of
mass destruction! America
is the only country on the
planet to have dropped an
atomic bomb on another
country. The immediate
destruction was bad
enough, but what about the
nuctear fallout, not just for
Japan but for the region?
Did America care? They
fegarded that as a major
achievement in the annals
of technology and modern
wasfare! So much for car-
ing about the planet! And
the refusal of the Bush Ad-
ministration to sign the
Kyoto Accord, what does

that say about commitment
to the well-being of the
Planet and the rest of us
mortals who are not Ameri-
cans? And the use of agent
orange in Vietnam, was
that humane?

Mt is my belief that the
power and might of the
American people is par-
Ually based on their dam-
aged psyche. Institutional-
ised violence and brutality
desensitises them to the
feelings, aspirations and
sensitivities of the rest of
the world. A judicial sys-
tem based on brutality can-
Not creale justice, just as
war and destruction can
never bring about peace.

After the liberation strug-
gle, both South Africa and
Namibia removed the death
sentence from their legal
systems. None of our op-
pressors and persecutors
was condemned to death,
and no Nuremberg -type tri-
als were held to revenge
the deeds of the past, dur-
ing which thousands also
fost their lives over many
decades. Instead, we opted
for reconciliation, and we
are all the better for that.
This seif-same aparthe+d re~
gime in South Africa was
supported by the USA as
was Unita in Angola. Bill
Clinton's administration
went as far as requesting
the De Klerk government
to ensure thal no nuclear
technology felt into the

hands of the Mandela-led
ANC government, because -
they could not trust the new
black leaders! They were
happy to throw their tot in
with the white pariah racist
regime, but they would not
trust the new black govern-
ment.

No, we do not need any
form of moralising from
those who backed our ersi-
while persecutors. We par-
ticularly have no interest in
being on “their side!” Back-
ing ourselves certainly does
not imply backing terror-
ism and that is what the
Bush administration is so.
clumsily trying toinfer in its
Statemem that “we are ¢i-
ther with them or against
them!”

Americans need to di-
vest themselves of the no-
tion of revenge as a means
of creating a peaceful
world. They can do so by
distancing themselves from
their own forms of institu-
tionalised violence, which
they mistakenly believe tq
be justice. And they can
begin to show some regard
for the millions of us who
are not Americans, and who
do not share all of their
values, ethics and morals
notwithstanding.

The rest of the wortd does
NOT have to catch a cold
when Amenca sneezes!

MUCH is being said about
Angola but less has been
done to address the root
causes of its long-running
problem. The so-called
peace-loving countries
have not alleviated the
situation but have aggra-
vated it by fuelling the
war with the supply of
arms to warring parties,
sometimes based on bind
loyalty.

To put it briefly: after
the unceremonious with-
drawal of the Portuguese
colonialists in Angola,
there was an historic meet-
ing in Portugal. The three
nationalist movements,
Movement for the Popu-
lar Liberation of Angola
(MPLA), the National
Union for the Total Inde-
pendence of Angola
(Unita) and the National
Front for the Liberation
of Angola(FNLA) signed
the Alvor Accords on
January 15, 1975.

The Alvor agreement
provided for a joint in-
tenm government and in-
tegrated national army.
However, as the date for
military integration
acared, the agreement
broke down. By mid- 1975
the three groups were at
war and the US and Rus-
sta rushed to involve
themselves.

On May 3! 1991 the
Bicesse Accord was reu-
fred, calling for the Gov-
emmment and Unita forces
to integrate into a $0 000
strong military force. The
Accord contained a ‘Tri-
ple Zero’ clause which
prohibited eather party to
the conflict from purchas-
ing ocw weaponry, while
the MPLA remained the
legitimate government,
holding responsibility for
running the state during
an interim period.

Russia had been one of
the three observing
‘Troika’ members in the
peace process. But it has
also long been a suppber
of weapons to Angola.
The Angotan Government
had unul 1998 a S$6billion
debt to Russia, all of itdue
to weapons purchases.
After segotiations in
1998, such debt was re-
duced to about $1,$ mil-
lion. Because of the out-
standing debt, the deal bad
to be funded mainly
through diamond joiat

venture arrangements. as

well as some oil and min-
ing concessions and fish-
ingrights. Kazakhstan has
admitted that in 1998 11
transferred Russian mati-
tary equipment to Angola.

Portugal remains tied to
Angola by its history. Itis
that country’s main noa-
oil trading partner. The
Portuguese government
has always been partisan,
supporting only the
MPLA in spite of its posi-
ton as a member of the
observing ‘Troika’. (Por-
tugal, Russiaand US form
the Troika).

Under the Lusaka Pro-

their continued lack of
confidence im the peace

maa rights contributed to
the collapse of the Lusaka

THANK you for your services and for
“sull telling it hike it is"", despite some
people who only like you doing that
when it is in their favour. But today’s
front page (Wednesday January 30)
is beyond the limits of what we need to
know. In other words: the picture on
today’s front page is below your level
of journalism and nears your paper to
the low level The Windhoek Observer,
which I stopped buying when it pub-
lished the picture of the French chil-
dren that were murdered on the Caprivi-
Highway some years ago.
If I read in an article that a young man
killed his grandmother for N$SOO in

cash than this is bad enough. If I then
have to read that he used an axe, it is
more than enough. How should my
level of information be enhanced by
seeing the picture? Instead I would
rather like to know how a person can go
so far, better. how can a young person
lose his human and social values to
such an extent? What do the neigh-
bours and relatives say? How do they
think that they (and us) can prevent
such gruesome crimes in future?
Why are these kinds of crimes so much
increasing nowadays? How did people
deal with them traditionally? etc. It is
this kind of question I would rather be

interested in than seeing a dead kuku

with an axe in her head. Peace to her

soul. | am also concemed about the

feelings of the family of the victim and

the culpnt not to menuon all the other
people like desperate youngsters who
sec this picture. Why do they need to be
exposed to such atrocities? Do you

When Headmen March On 4th Term

THE recent marching of Swapo kings and head-
men is a wrong move. It’s a pity that our people,
when they are in numbers sup the same
idea, think they are right. They think that means
“one Namibia, one nation”. What we must think
of is what the fourth term means for us as Namibian
nation, not to make one man happy. What is the
extent of its advantages and disadvantages? The
fourth term is costly. It will lead to more hunger
and poverty. Peace can never be maintained by an
individual human being, unless it is deserved by
all.

The demanded referendum is an additional
election. Where will the millions of dollars come
from? Will the nation be sacrificed again for an
individual advantage and benefit? Are we really
serious? To change the constitution to allow a
fourth term means money (millions). This burden
will be put on the already suffering Namibian
shoulders. Hearing the Government has

The money will be misspent as we still have a
high unemployment rate in the country and those
in the recent youth service scheme from
Grootfontein could be employed. Or is it Swapo
party that will fund the referendum?

The extent of love within a human being is the
same as hatred. Chiluba in Zambia is an example
of the peoples’ turning point from love to hatred.
Next, the same people who are chanting. “We did

respect of our country’s constitution by him and
the misuse of our country’s limited resources for

demanding a third and fourth term? He will also

Right Wing Afrikaners, Take Note!

TREAD with shock and dismay in The Namibian of
November 12 about the activities of the so called
‘Boer nation warriors’. I want to express my views.

Ido not know whether the “boerevolk Krygers”
elements are also present in Namibia, but if there are
such members or those who are aspiring to such
ideas, keep such ideas dormant infinitely. It is
friendly advice.

I am very concerned about this terrorist move-
ment causing havoc tn South Africa with its result-
ant destruction and disregard for human life and
property. This movement, although it has been in
existence for years, has surely come at the wrong
time. Those conservative, radical boers must know
that they do not live in Utopia whereby theywant to”
promote the ideology of Aryan nationalism. They
must learn to live with diversity. We are all people
of different colours and that we have to live side by
side. No one ts superior or inferior to the other. To

be bad 1s not an inherent character, it ts a learned
habit due to the environment in which one is raised.
Anyone can be bad.

Criminality is not confined toa specific race. No!
Itis part of human existence and under certain social

circumstances and living conditions anyone is a

potential criminal.
This reminds me of what Mr Hannes Smith (edi-

tor of Windhoek Observer) once wrote. I quote. ‘No
man/woman ts born a criminal. Criminals are made
by conditions, environmental factors, to say noth-
ing of social conditions”. How true are those words
from an open-minded person.

Those who are aiming to wipe out the black nation
(in case of Soweto) must know that the black man
can act in the same way. Does it sound inciteful or
a threat (o you? Maybe, but not to me. Together we
can make or break this world.

Nine bombs in all were enough to take away many
innocent lives.

When one’s livelihood is threatened. you invent
ways to counteract in order to protect yourself to
survive. Let us live in peace rather than war. War ts
bad so let us avoid racial hatred since we did not
choose who we are. Let us find lasting pragmatic
solutions that would see us through to the next
development level. Life was meant to be lived by

all. No one has a patent on life.

Happy About Fourth Term Cam

THE lingering debate and pos-
tunng by politcal pundits, tra-
ditional leadership, the ordi-

nary ciuzens and ‘outsiders’
about the need or not for Presi-
dent Nujomato run for another
term, the so called ‘Fourth
Term’ as Head of State, can be
likened to a rhinoceros, which
looks different depending on
where the observer is standing
and what portion of its anatomy
he/she 1s concentrating on.
Each perspecuve has some Par-
ucular insights andeachis only
a part of the whole!

As an ordinary Namibian
ciazen from the Caprivi Re-
gion, I am therefore delighted
to hear of yet another concerted
and well-orchestrated cam-
Paign to convince and/or urge
our President to seek another
term.

There 1s an American Say-
ing, “ifitain’tbroken, don't fix
10"". My position is simple and
gRoes something like thts: the
inconclusive leadership transt-
tion (no domestic pun intended
since mostof the senior leaders
in the Party and Government
are seasoned, tested and com-
Petent) that the recently held
Swapo Congress Produced,
raises important questions
about who will really be in
command should President
Nujoma step down after the
expiry of his current term.

While Iam a Breat believer
In ‘collective leadership’ (it’s
casy if you are one of the cho-
sen ones), I suppose I’ve be-
come disillusioned with poli-
tics - and I think most
Namibians have become disil-
lusioned with poliucians too.

An intellectual friend of
mine once commented,
“Namibians don't want to ac.
cepl excuses any more - if
there’s moncy tobe stolen, why
isn’t there money for the peo-
ple?” It would appear we sull
don't have our pnorities nghte.

Once upon a time I was al-
ways fixing everyone else's
problems, but not my own and
guess where it landed me?
What has all this to do with the
Fourth Term, you may ask?

Despite a mosaic of tnbula-
uons and misplaced pnonities,
every day I ask the question:
‘Can President Sam Nujoma
do no wrong?” The answer is
an emphatic NO.

Namibians love him above
all other Ministers and even
the feeble and weak Opposi-
tion grudgingly admires his

Poltucal talent. At his age,
President Nuyoma has lostnone
of his charisma he had in exile
and ts a man of al} Seasons

any comer of this great nation
of ours.

Perhaps the Breatest asset
credited to President Nuyoma

els of security, provided qual-

Facing Up To Destructive Forces in Namibia

NAMIBIA is one of the few
countries in Africa that contin-
ues to enjoy peace, stability and
unily as a nation after the cruel
joke of colontalism was disman-
tled for more than a decade
Colonialism made us a united
nation, because all of us faced
one external enemy at that dark
time in our history. Unfortu-
nately, as independent people
we no longer umite as one. An
apparent external enemy no
longer threatens us. In the ab-
sence of this enemy it 1s much
easier for some people to mis-
take their fellow ciuzens as pos-
sible foes So these foes should
be confronted through tribal af-
filrauons.

Destrucave forces such as tnb-
alism, favouriosm and nepousm
have now taken root in our na-
tion. Tribalism will bring disre-

pute to the present anity of our

nation. The waity of
tioned by people

themselves increasingly pushed
aside to the edges or periphery
of society. So they have to sur-

vive on the crumbs which fall
from the table.

At the present momentif your
find yourself in this country you
are fortunate tn terms of political
stabrhty. Itis not good for many
counties in Africa. Disorder,
chaos and fratncidal war are con-
unuing to disruptorcut short the
life of many common fellow Af-
ncans in those countries.

Ordinary people or laymen do
not choose such an intolerable
muserable situation. The pohtu-
cal elite did indeed bring Cain's
curse on their counmes. All the

problems are not of their own
making Some problems might
be duc to external dependence
and external influence.
In Namibia we are not com-
pletely free from all types of
lems. We have problems of

nomic and political system and
makes it bleed internally that
can be difficult to see with a
naive eye.

Thirdly. crime and other so-
cialevils are making the lives of
innocent and law-abiding citi-
zens difficult. Despite all these
problems we are still relatuvely
at peace with one another politi-
cally. But this peace can be short-
lived as long as these problems
remain withus. Itcan be likened
to a bird flying in the air, anyone
can killit by shooung or stoning

if one wants to.
But let us not be like a nation
of ignoramuses about our reja-

tive stability, peace and unity.

‘Big Goats Don’t Sneeze Without Reason’

ALLOW me space in the peopk’s
paper to air my views on same issues
that are not right in our country. I am
disheartened by the receatevents where
our commander in chief criticised one
section of our community, namely the
whites. Whatis happening? What went
wrong?

There is asaying, which goes: ‘a big
goa does not sneeze without a rea-
son”. If there is something going on
about the whites in this country then
we as citizens also deserve the right to
know. To blame people just out of the
blue is not a good thing, especially
when it is done by a person who is
supposed to unite the whole nation.

What has happened to our policy of
national reconciliation? Is it working or
dead? Of course it is the government
that brought itinto being and if itis dead
then we as a nation also deserve to
know so that we can also start criticis-
ing some fellow blacks who did us
wrong during the liberation struggle. J
lost my brother because my neighbour
reported him to the South African army
to be a ‘terrorist’. I have forgiven him
but I did not forget. J am also fully
aware of the atrocities that the Germans
and the South African colonisers have
committed againstour people but which
whites did this kind of thing? Is itGwen
Lister? Is it Hannes Smith? Believe
me these whites, Gwen and Hannes,
also suffered but of course not the
same way the blacks did. Just like
today some blacks are driving beauti-
ful 4x4s because it suits their status
while some fellow blacks are going

hungry with no shelter, nothing.

I cannot understand that 13 years
after independence whites are still
causing divisions amongst the people.
Are we so stupid that we (blacks)
cannot think for ourselves? How can
we allow ourselves to be divided by
others? Maybe there is something
wrong with our systems, which in fact
might be causing divisions and not the
whites. How many white farmers are
ministers today? How many whites
are CEOs? Of course many are com-
mercial farmers and is it this which is
causing problems? We have the right
to know.

Saying whites are causing division
while we have the full commanding
power to me is a joke. Fine, we have
the capacity todeal with them. Why do
we say this instead of just acting but of
course acting with reason? We must
alsoexamine oursetves before we stast-
pointing fingers at others. I think peo-
ple that are causing division are the
ones that are stealing the public funds
So that the government will be unable
to provide for its citizens. Those are
the people who need to be dealt with.
We must try to empower all of our
citizens. Let the whole nation enjoy
the fruits of independence. If we ig-
hore that we are just inviting more and
more trouble and then we will blame it
on the whites. Do not laugh at the
snake because it walks on its belly.

We must also understand that in a
country of beggars, stealing and not
begging is considered a crime. There
isasaying, which says ‘stealing brings

misfortune”. There are too many steal-
ing in government and no concrete
steps are taken. All one hears is pres-
idential commissions.

They are becoming too many now
and their findings are just gathering
dust wherever they take place. Don’t
we have the capacity to deal with
criminals

and thieves in this country? I sug-
gest if we have the capacity to deal
with whites we must also use the same
capacity to deal with thieves especial-
ly the ones that are embezzling the
public funds.

When is the six million Namibian
dollars going to be retumed? And who
is going to return it and how? Do
whites cause these things? If yes, then
there is something wrong with us, I
mean the black people. We like “nice”
things but we hate working hard. We
are good af blaming others but we
neves tum the finger on ourselves. Of
course whites are hard workers that is
why they have what they have today.
Of course some of them have acquired
their riches by exploiting us but now
there are laws in place that are prevent-
ing this kind of things from happen-
ing. It all depends on how committed
we are to such laws.

I know that whoever reads this letter
might say that I am an enemy of the
state but unfortunately I am just being
realistic. [am nota CoD, nora DTA or
a RP. I am just myself with my own
do not have their own brain will want
to shut me off. Let’s not blame the

whites but rather blame ourselves for
our own misfortune. These days the
comrade is not always right because
some comrades are hungry and they
are doing whatever they can do to be
like other comrades. What are the 17
farms for?

Tt must be clear to each and every
Namibian, whether you are black or
white, Herero or Ovambo, Damara or
Caprivi, Nama or Tswana, San or Ka-
vango, Himba or others that Namibia
is independent forever. Hans Dreyer,
Koevoet, SWATF, SADF and Bothas
ase gone forever. If ever they will
come back we should blame it on
ourselves and not on the whites.

God created us with a brain to dis-
tinguish between what is right and
what is wrong. If you let yourself be
misled, blame it on yourself. The pot-
iticians should also stop working on
our emotions and feelings. We know
how hard it was during the liberation
struggle. We were there when our
homes were destroyed and burned
down. We were there when our ma-
hangu fields were destroyed. We were
there when our own children were
killed. We were there at Niimwandi.
We know all these things. To tell us
these days that whites are bad while
you are enjoying their company at
your farms and in your neighbour-
hood is just a joke to us.

We know how dusty itis in Katutura
but we are still there. We know all
those things and we also know that
Namibia is unfortunately a mother for
all of us. All we need to hear now is

economic development, peace and sta-
bility, employment opportunities and
projects so that we can develop our
community.

We don't want to bear hate speech-
es. We know how bad and terrible the
war was. We don’t want WAR, we
want PEACE.

We must remember that there is no
lion which cannot miss a chase, and
there is no pond that the sun cannot dry.
Life is when you are together, alone
you are an animal. In Oshiwambo there
is saying that says “Pombili iha pa
potwa!"" Translate it yourself.

Let us all work together and be
united as we were during the dark days
of the liberation struggle. Whites are
not enemies today but our enemies are
hunger, disease, poverty, ignorance,
nepotism, tribalism, hatred, cormup-
Gon, sexism, self-centeredness etc. The
list is too long. Namibian develop-
ment needs us all. We cannot talk of
development if we are blaming and
attacking other people. If we keep on
blaming whites, they may say, “though
1am not edible says the vulture, yet
nurse my eggs in the branches of a
high wee because man is hard to be
wusted.” I hope we don't want this to
happen. We must also remember “he
who finds the occasion to hurt others
will be hurt by them tomorow. We
don’t want this to happen either.

Let us build and develop our Na-
mibia. Viva the Republic of Namibia

Petrus Festus, Windhoek",Man Be Called To Order?,"Hot be assassinatedPetrus Festus, Windhoek",20031212,peace,Peace.20031212_page_1.txt,1,"Why Should Human Rights
Man Be Called To Order?

THIS is miy reply to the Namibia
Today article titled ‘It is high time
for Phil ya Nangoloh to be called to
order’ published in the Swapo
mouthpiece on November 21 2003.

Asapeace loving Namibian I read
with concem the above mentioned
article which shows the intolerance
of some of the Swapo people towards
human rights and democracy in this
country. In an attempt to silence
Namibta's only vibrant and fearless
human rights organisation and its
executive director, Swapo through
its mouth piece Namibia Today urged
subordinates that “It is high time for
Phil ya Nangoloh to be called to
order”,

I ask myself why the NSHR
director should be “called to order”?
The article made some allegations
about what Swapo claims to be
“fabricated stories”.

Please allow me space in your
newspaper to respond to the said
claim directed at Phil ya Nangoloh,
in particular, and the NSHR, in
general. I want to correct these
misleading and misdirected
allegations.

Swapo claims that Ya Nangoloh
“fabricated” stories with the purpose
of “discrediting Namibian security
forces” because the NSHR made
several reports that Namibian and
Angolan security forces have killed
innocent Angolans during the recent
conflict in the Kavango and Caprivi.
Everybody knows by bow thateither
through eyewitness reports or
through the reports by Amnesty
Intemational, Human Rights Watch
and the NSHR that there were several
killings committed by the Namibian
security forces both in Namibja and
Angola. Even recently a member of
the Namibian security forces, a
certain SFF commander, testified in
the High Court that he and other
Namibian security force members
were given orders and have carried
out such orders to shoot and kill
people during the night in the
Kavango region.

As for the Swapo question orclaim

thatthe government should not worry
about ineffective groups like Tagoma
referring to the recent murder of
Tagoma leader Shevanyenga, I
would like to say this to Swapo: the
late Mr Shevanyenga was a

Namibian citizen like everyone else *

and the government is held
responsible for the security of every
Namibian. Therefore I see no point
for several government and Swapo
leaders to.issue death threats to an
ineffective group which finally led
to Shevanyenga’s death.

Thirdly, Swapo accused Mr Phil
ya Nangoloh to have “fabricated a
story of people who were perceived
to be eliminated, apparently also by
government.”

Itis a fact that Mr Phil ya Nangoloh
and other NSHR haman rights
defenders received death threats on
several occasions. This makes it
difficult for them to carry out their
activities which is what Swapo
wants. However the NSHR and Mr
ya Nangoloh must be praised and
not condemmed and threatened for
their courage to have shed light on

- such incredible and cowardly

attempts to undermine the defence
of human rights and democracy in
this country. By publicising the
names of persons likely to be
assassinated the NSHR most
probably has saved the lives of more
Namibians who might be facing
assassinations. In so doing, the
NSHR also strongly defended the
principles of democracy and good
governance and respect for the rule
of law in this country as enshrined in
our Namibian constitution.
Fourthly, Swapo goes on with its
accusations against Ya Nangolohby
denying that there was or there is no
“cross border” trade with Angola on
the part of the NDF. However, there
is strong evidence that the NDF made
use of State vehicles and NDF
soldiers to casry out such border
trade in building materials apparently
for the enrichment of certain
individuals. The NDF themselves
have never denied the NSHR report.

Fifthly, Swapo further claims that
if Ya Nangoloh “do(es) not want to
live under Swapo government, he
should just pack and go instead of
indulging himself in dangerous
subversive activities.” This
misleading statement must be
styongly rejected and condemned
with the contempt it deserves. Ya
Nangoloh and the NSHR have both
the right and duty to accurately
informed the Namibian and other
peace loving peoples about human
fights violations by whoever and
whenever such violations occur.

Human rights and democracy are
foreign to Swapo and Namibia Today
and this is why the NSHR activities
are called “dangerous subversive
activities.”

It is also not understandable how
the NSHR and Ya Nangoloh are
indulging in any “dangerous
subversive activities” by defending
human rights principles and

corruption which is so
rampant in this country. To me such
activities are duties ofeach andevery
responsible Namibian citizen.

Furthermore, it is imperative to
note that the dangerous threats
Swapo_ has made urging Ya
Nangoloh to “just (to) pack and go”
are aclear indication that the list that
the NSHR recently produced after
polting the opinion of several citizens
is far away from being misleading.
Other people can now see for
themselves from the Swapo
intimidation as published in Namibia
Today. lask myself what willhappen
to Mr ya Nangoloh if he does not
“pack and go” as suggested by
Swapo, especially after being |:
accused of “indulging himself in
dangerous subversive activities.”
Will he not be assassinated like
Shevanyenga?

Swapo must know that they and
their government will be held fully
responsible for anything happening
to Ya Nangoloh and other human
tights defenders in this country

I WOULD like to express my disappointment and
dismay through your newspaper regarding the
tuling for the Caprivi 13 accused by Judge Elton
Hoff.

Judge Hoff’s ruling for the 13 demonstrated to
the nation that the judiciary in Namibia is in the
wrong hands.

If we look at this issue critically, the judgement
was well orchestrated to be interpreted as if the
Government did not follow whatever rules or
procedures should be followed. But, in fact, Judge
Hoff formulated it (thé ruling) in such a way as to
allow the state to re-arrest them, creating room for
‘reactionary institutions’ (sic.) to cry foul about
the judiciary and painting Namibia as a country
which does not respect its own laws. This is not the
case at all.

The charges remain: the accused allegedly
planned and declared war against the Government
of the Republic of Namibia. Where we supposed to
sit back with our tails between our legs, while our
hard-earned peace is being disrupted and our
country being destabilised?

We all know the results of war - the disruption of
the well-earned peace, destruction of property,
loss of life, hunger, poverty and other setbacks.
Those who wanted to secede the Caprivi had
misguided objectives, were driven by selfishness
and hunger for political power and they — if found
guilty - should rot in jail.

The security forces should be commended for
swift action and a job well done. They have sent a

clear message to would-be terrorists that Namibia
isa well-protected democratic country and whoever
tampers with her sovereignty will feel the wrath of
the Namibian law.

Whose interest does the so-called court ruling
serve?

What made the 13 accused leave the country
under the cover of night? Who invited them to the
neighbouring countries were they were hiding? If
they had a genuine cause, why didn’t they hand
themselves over to the authorities of the countries
in which they were hiding?

But were Judge Hoff and his court blind and deaf
the day when he ruled that return of the 13 to
Namibia violated some international laws and
procedures guiding extradition.

Which procedures did the !3 follow when they
allegedly carried out their attack at Katima Mulilo?
Why should we follow some procedures by bringing
misguided elements to be tried back home? Whois
he (Judge Hoff) to determine the fate and the
interest of the Namibian nation?

(Under the Namibian Constitution, the accused
is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

libellous statements and possible contempt of court.

NAMIBIAN voters havea right to be informed inorder
to cast their votes with commitment and maturity as
far as their future is concerned. [tis in that context that
we - again - request “leaders” to stick to the rules of
democracy and free and fair elections.

Mr. Tyirtange, your previous position as Minister of
Justice should have instilled a respect for the Namibian
Constitution in you. That should at least reach as far as
knowing that it is NOT SWAPO that created the
Namibian Defence Force, Police, Civil Service etc. etc.
- that is an obligation every Government of a country
has.

Swapo is just another political party and not the
Government. Sic - we do not live in 1960 anymore - the
year 2044 1s here and we have and want to move on.

We all have an understanding that you might still
fee! bitter about your past - let us, however, look ahead
and rather work for a future that does not bring back
those years. Namibia has so many problems that need
tangible solutions. Solutions will not be found by clinging
on to the past and asking weird questions hke: “What
did Ben Ulenga tell the Boers to be released?”

Absurd statements like “the CoD has been created
by colontalists”.

By the way, Sir, the CoD is a legitimate political
party and not an organisation. You can condemn the
“colonisers” till eternity - as fong as you, the Swapo
party, still depend on them for food assistance for
Namibians your statements boomerang.

Tell the voters why is it necessary to apply for N$37.7
million donor assistance to feed Namibians?

Teli the voters why only foreigners get major building
contracts these days?

Tell the voters why they - after 14 years of
mdependence - stul live in shacks and shambles?

Why is almost every municipality bankrupt in
Nambia? .

Why is each and every parastatal costing the
Namibian taxpayers milhons and millions?

Sir -yvouas former Minister of Justice - should cry out
loud: babies and toddlers are raped on a daily basis.
Criminals rule the country - Namibtans get murdered
for a few dollars - corruption never gets punished.

The hist, Lam afraid, is endless! The Police force ts ill
equipped. ill-trained - why would Windhock otherwise
ask for a Municipal Police Force?

The Namibian Defence Force - whois insane enough
to want to attack Namibia - Nambia does not need that
Force. The money could be spent on housing/educations
health services etc. etc. All these and many more
pressing issues and what can be done about it.

That makes up election material for many months —
Sir-notyour defamations and agitating hate speeches.

Howeser-af your attacks on the CoD are an indicator
to vo by - the Cob is doing a good job and giving you
ample reason to see an opposition in that party,

Mr Tjitianye, please come up with solutions for
Namibians since we all Know that the tax pavers — and
thatincludes opposition party members - pay for Swapo
rallies

We have peace in Namibia - thatis also a credit Co
opposition partes since we can argue in parliament
and don't hase to take up weapons - lets keep it that
way. please. and let's tackle Namibia's multuple

NAMIBIAN voters have a right to be informed in order
to cast their votes with commitment and maturity as
far as their future is concerned. [t is in that context that
we - again - request “leaders” to stick to the rules of
democracy and free and fair elections.

Mr. Tjiriange, your previous position as Minister of
Justice should have instilled a respect for the Namibian
Constitution in you. That should at least reach as far as
knowing that it is NOT SWAPO that created the
Namibian Defence Force, Police, Civil Service etc. etc.
- that is an obligation every Government of a country
has.

Swapo is just another political party and not the
Government. Sir - we do not live in 1960 anymore - the
year 2004 is here and we have and want to move on.

We all have an understanding that you might still
feel bitter about your past - let us, however, look ahead
and rather work for a future that does not bring back
those years. Namibia has so many problems that need
tangible solutions. Solutions will not be found by clinging
on to the past and asking weird questions like: “What
did Ben Ulenga tell the Boers to be released?”

Absurd statements like “the CoD has been created
by colonialists”’.

By the way, Sir, the CoD is a legitimate political
party and not an organisation. You can condemn the
“colonisers” till eternity - as long as you, the Swapo
party, still depend on them for food assistance for
Namibians your statements boomerang.

Tell the voters why is it necessary to apply for N$37.7
million donor assistance to feed Namibians?

Tell the voters why only foreigners get major building
contracts these days?

Tell the voters why they - after 14 years of
independence - still live in shacks and shambles?

Why is almost every municipality bankrupt in
Namibia? .

Why is each and every parastatal costing the
Namibian taxpayers millions and millions?

Sir - youas former Minister of Justice - should cry out
loud: babies and toddlers are raped on a daily basis.
Criminals rule the country - Namibians get murdered
for a few dollars - corruption never gets punished.

The list, | am afraid, is endless! The Police force is ill
equipped, ill-trained - why would Windhoek otherwise
ask for a Municipal Police Force?

The Namibian Defence Force - who is insane enough
to want to attack Namibia - Namibia does not need that
Force. The moncy could be spent on housing/education/
health services etc. etc. All these and many more
pressing issues and what can be done about it.

That makes up election material for many months -
Sir - not your defamations and agitating hate speeches.

However - if your attacks on the CoD are an indicator
to go by - the CoD is doing a good job and giving you
ample reason to see an opposition in that party.

Mr. Tjiriange, please come up with solutions for
Namibians since we all know that the tax payers ~ and

AS a matter of principle, I don’t
engage in sub-standard argu-
ments, but there’re exceptions,
especially when utterances of
the anti-democratic forces beg
for an appropriate response.

It’s high time, brothers and
sisters, that the misguided
elements in our society are taken
to task and their bigotry exposed.

If peace-loving Namibians
remain silent any longer, this
country will got to the monkeys

It seems the anti-democratic
forces are having a good time in

ing like extra-terrestrial beings
and becoming more dangerous
every passing day.

They are misusing all avenues
- talk shows, discussion panels,
conferences, etc.

The sad case in point: Mr.
Paulus Kapia’s and Honourable
Petrus Ilonga’s pointed accusa-
tions of the judiciary. They,
deliberately disregard common
sense and logic.

Were they not supposed to
know better? Why, then, did

they - out of their own free will
- choose the road of demago-
guery and hostile agitation? Is
that their only “tick” to discredit
the judiciary in general, and
Judge Elton Hoff in particular?

Another sad case in point is
Mr. Jordan Atshipara's letter
(Judge Hoff’s judgement
disappoints - Namibian 9/3/
2004).

At one point he says: “The
charges remain: the accused
allegedly planned and declared
war against the Government of
the Republic of Namibia. Were
we supposed to sit back with
our tails between our legs, while
our hard-earned peace is being
disrupted and our country being
destabilised?”

And I say: You missed the
poim altogether. The case before
Judge Hoff was not one of high
treason but one of unlawful
extradition. Even if it was acase
of “alleged” high treason that
remains an “allegation” to be
tested in a competent court of
law (not a kangaroo court or
something).

He says: “We all know the
results of war ... those who want
to secede the Caprivi .... If found
guilty - should rot in jail.”

And I say: So! There is stilla
possibility of them being found
guilty - wait till thea!

He asks: “But were Judge
Hoff and his court blind and
deaf the day when he ruled that
return of the 13 to Namibia
violated some intemational laws
and procedures guiding
extradition?

Which procedures did the 13
follow when they allegedly
carried out their attack at Katima
Mulilo? Why should we follow
some procedures by bringing
misguided elements to be tried
back home?”

And I say: It seems we are
dealing with an arrogant misgui-
ded element who believes that
the State should not follow
proce-dures simply because
alleged terrorists did the same,
ah?

He asks: “Who is he (Judge
Hoff) to determine the fate and
the interest of the Namibian

nation?”

And I ask: Are you accusing
the Government of bringing
high treason suspects before an
“unknown Judge”, who has no
right “to determine the fate and
interest of the Namibian
nation”?

Come on guys; let’s be
serious!

Why not consider the real
causes for the Swapo Party
Government's poor
performance before Namibian
and international courts
(Kasikili!)? Like, for example,
negligent legal advisers,
incompetent State prosecutors,
reckless police investigations
and indefensible violations, by

Anyway, why have laws and

KINDLY allow me space
in your highly esteemed
newspaper to comment on
the opinion piece of Phil ya
Nangoloh which appeared
in the Namibian of April 16,
2004. fam of the opinion that
statements of that nature and
in that fashion should not be
left unchallenged by patriotic
citizens.

Prophets of Doom have
always been there since time
memorial, but the opinion
piece in question does not
only predict a bleak future
for the country but also mis-
lead the readers with regard
to the calibre of President
Sam Nujoma and that of the
Swapo Party of Namibia
lest we forget why Swapo
emerged.

Such statements should be
rejected with the contempt
it deserves by all patriotic
citizens and the international!
friends of Namibia.

The opinion piece created
an impression that our in-
cumbent President is power
hungry, and also misrepre-
sents the facts relating to the
so-called infighting among
the Swapo Party rank and file
with regard to succession and
a lack of democracy in the
structures of the party.

Every movement or or-
ganisation has its power

dynamics and Swapo Party
should not be singled out for
criticism. The recent breaka-
way factions of the Official
Opposition are testimony
that power dynamics exist
in all organisations.

1 would like to state that,
people of Ya Nangoloh’s
calibre should know better
about the political dynamics
in this country and should
lead the illiterate masses to
the truth and not make use
of public platforms and their
knowledge to mislead the
youth and future generations
of tomorrow. Itis unfortunate
to note that right from the be-
ginning when he emerged as
the Director of the National
Society for Human Rights, he
has opposed the Swapo Party
of Namibta, its government
and specifically its President
and poticies.

When one reads between
the lines of what he said
with regard to the Swapo
Party Central Committee
decision to nominate three
candidates for President, not
only of the Swapo Party but
also of the country after Dr.
Sam Nujoma, one gets the
impression that Swapo does
not have democracy and that
all decisions are dictatorially
taken by President Nujoma.

Thisisaclear misrepresen-

tation of what Swapo is all
about and is intended to sow
seeds of doubt and mistrust
in the people but also for
the much needed investors
intending to invest in the
country. One just wonders
who really pulls the strings
of Mr. Ya Nangoloh?

Democracy was brought
in Namibia by Swapo and
its leader President Sam
Nujoma. It has been proven
beyond reasonable doubt at
the formation of the Swapo
Party and recently by the
Swapo Party Central Com-
Mittee meeting of April 2
2004 that the interest of the
nation is far more important
than that of an individual.

I hereby submit that is
has also been proven by
the founding father of the
nation and first President of
the independent Republic of
Namibia io his tast State of
the Nation’s Address that he
will leave office by March 21
2005. with confidence that
the new head of state will
build on the foundation that
we have built collectively.
Let us give praise to a great
leader comrade!

Ya Nangoloh also cites the
State House project to justify
his claims, forgetting that the
project is for the nation and
not for an individual, and as

it was eartier said, “the State
House project should repre-
sent the nation's pride (Not
the current one thal represent
a fallen racist regime of the
former Apartheid South
African administration) and
should be a national monu-
ment for current and future

It is only those who are

hend, those who are humble

Mentto builda national mon-
ument of that magnitude. |
am confident that if] goto the
graves of Mr. Ya Nangoloh’s
parents, I will be able to find
atombstone. Why should all
citizens and a free nation not
have something to relate to,
to be proud of and to identify
themselves with?

T would like to focus on Ya
Nangoloh’s opinion piece in
particular but not limit my-
self to mention that in general
people are out there to mis-
lead the nation. InSwapo we
have learnt to tolerate this,
but I am of the opinion that
they should be opposed and
excluded by all peace loving
and progressive citizens, by
all means possible!

Mr. Ya Nangoloh, the Pres-
ident is not so narcissistic to
fire the cadres that he has

led as you think and suggest
in your opinion piece. The
President will not dissolve
the Parliament to cling to
power, the President is not
Robert Mugabe and for that
matter Namibia is certainly
Not going to take the Zim-
babwe route to resolve the
land issue.

A government should
make decisions that are in
the interest of the nation and
agovernment is mandated by
the electorate to make deci-
sions on their behalf. The
decision to expropriate land
is in the national interest and
inline with the constitutional
provisions. As bona fida
members of the Party, we
expect our leaders to take
action and implement the
Swapo Party Manifestoof the
last elections. Please do not
try to score cheap political
points in this regard.

I would like to thank the
President of the Republic of
Namibia on behalf of those
who argue like me for the
generous contribution he has
made to the future of the Land
of the Brave. Your dedicated
service during the struggle
and after independence will
never be forgotten. Your wise
philosophical saying that,
“a victim never forgets, but
the doer does” is true in the

circumstances.

Those who criticise the
people’s movement Swapo,
and its founding leader today
was part and parcel of the
system that caused a lot of
inequities in all social struc-
tures of the black people.

Mr. Ya Nangoloh’s opin-
ion piece and those that are
similar in content are not
welcome in Namibia, par-

‘ticularly at a time that the

people are nominating their
next leader. Remember, we
shall forgive but never forget
what happened in Namibia
prior to independence and
especially those who have
sacrificed their lives for this
nation. Today we are a free
people with only one aim; to
restore our dignity and claim
back what was stolen and
what belongs to us.

I would like to conclude
by quoting his Excellency in
his last State of the Nation's
address, “A united people
striving to achieve a com-
mon goal for all members
of the society, wit! always
remain victorious”. Let
these philosophical words
of wisdom be the building
blocks of our future endeav-
ours comrades.

Windhoek",The Struggle Has Served,s to dwnSt SharplesWindhoe,20040518,peace,Peace.20040518_page_1.txt,1,"The Struggle Has Served Namibia Well

1AM not new to the liberation strug-
gles of southem Africa. In fact I was
bom into the struggle waged by the
ANC in South Africa and married
into the struggle waged by Swapo
in Namibia. Now, when you are bom
into something, it is part of you and
you are part of it, not by choice but
by birth. The liberation struggle was
about peopte, land and wealth. It was
about the inalienable right of people to
freedom. It was about reclaiming our
dignity as Africans and indigenous
inhabitants of the soi! of Africa. In
fact the liberation struggle bas been
about claiming the right to deciding
our own destiny as nations of Africa or
at tholoast, having some inputin such
decisions. lt was also about everyday
“bread and butter” issues.

Tam sure that anthropological ox-
perts will testify to the fact that one
of the outstanding charactenstics of
populations is that they are not stag-
nant, but are constantly undergoing
dynamic transformation. The aim is
to ensure that this mobility is upward
and forward instead of regressing.

For the masses the struggle has
been about basic human rights. The
right to protection, the right to food.
clothing, shelter, education, health
care and the nght to free association.
Whilst each one has to take respon-
sibility for their own actions and
life, it is the collective that has to
ensure that the correct ere
and environmental milieu as well as
systems and structures are in place
to guarantees a positive contribution
by the individual for the betterment
of the society. Internationally it is
the Breton Woods Institutions that
countries adhere to and support for
the sake of having workable and
organised societics.

This immediately calls on the
individual who has the right to be
ambitious to exercise Tansparency
and accountability. Hence the adop-
tion of a system called democracy.
The adoption of democracy does
not imply the adoption of a western
system, but is rather the implementa-
tion of the best workable system that

contains an assemblance of fairness
and exudes a sense of ational pride
and a sense of worthiness and dignity
to the socicty it serves. Democracy
can be customised to suit that par-
ticular nation’s needs.

The world has become a global
village mainly dus to the strides man
has made in information technology
as woil as the affordability and speed
with which people are able to travel
from continent to continent. In my
own travels | find that people have
a keen interest in socio-economic
and political matters on the African
continent and the world at large.

What | have observed is that the
populace of Africa is no longer pre-
pared to accept any sense of embar-
ressment because of corrupt political
teaders in their respective countries.
This goes for the people's intolerance
towards despouc tendencies from
whatever quarter.

I have montioned the masses and
their interest when it came to the
liberation struggles. However, it must
not be forgotten that it has been the
same masses that produced a robust
and solid revolutionary intelligentsta
able to interpret and practice real
politics.

Having come from the masses doca
not necessarily assume thal those
with power will not be corrupted by
hunger for such power. Nevertheless,
these appetites are kept in check
by the fact that there are others to
compete with as well as ihe voice
of the masses to contend with. The
reault is that the best persoo will then
win. Owing to the ever- changing
dynamics of society, leaderahip will
also change because at the end of the
day, leadership is about the people,
the collective, the nation and not the
indivicual.

The aim and art of both politics
and religion is to unify people and to
ensure the sustainability of that unity
through service dell very. In any capi-
taliet society, “service delivery” Is a
popular buzzword because the society
isenticod, tempted and encouraged to
consume. Financial interactions are

tainly cheracterised by producers
and consumers and members of the
population interchanging these roles.
The danger bere |s that the majority of
the population will become consum-
ers instead of contributors.

Many times this leads toa situation
where a minority of the population
become very wealthy with the rich
getting richer and the poor getting
poorer. The electronic media play
a rigorous role in encouraging this
state of affairs even through their
soep operas whose emphasis is on
wealth and immoral living. ©

The bottom line is that in order for
anation to actively engage in matters
that affect it’s existence, tho elected
political and charch leaders together
with the bureaucrats and technocrats
in both the public and private sector
have to present the nation with io-
novative cutting edge programs that
include all af society.

The last ime I counted, there were
forty-two countries holding elections
during the year of 2004 globally. This
means that there is a changing of the
guard taking piace in many countries
including Namibia. Friend and enenry
have toadmit that Namibia has main-
tained a powerful sense of political,
civil and economic stability, which
together have contri buted to the peace
and tranquillity of the country. The
Swapo leadership has proven their
tenacity and political maturity ovor
aod over agaln when issues, which
could have got out of hand, wore
handled with great craftiness and
smartness as well. That is why it
thould not come as a surprise to thoss
who undorstand the agenda of Swapo
that the president has announced his
decision to bring his teaure as head
of stato to a respectable, dignified
closure as would be oxpected of any
great African leader of our dmo. We
can aleo rest assured thal bo longer
boing the president of the Republic
does not sntomatically mean that it
is the end of our president's politi-
cal carcer.

In fact for me it is the continua-
tion of a powerful career, which is

pow to take another form. That of
African Stateaman, especially with
the intoresting evolution of the Af-
rican Union and programs such as
Nopad. [t is statesmen such as our
president and ex-president Nelson
Mandela together with others of their
generation and calibre that make us,
the younger generation proud of be-
ing African.

tremain convinced that Swapo like
other mass based politica! parties in
the sub-region definitely has the in-
terests of the nation and the country
at heart. | watch with amazement
how some of the media mies the

when the main issues go beyond the
individual. The thing is that no mat-
ter how much the prophets af doom
ecream and shout, the people are ot
prepared to trust anyone with their
lives and their children’s future, but
rather those men and women who
unselfishly led the liberation struggic.
Let us face it.

Service delivery for the masses and
the previously disadvantaged under a
Swapo government has taken place
‘and even reshaped the landscape of
the country. [1 is a grew achievo-
ment for a community thal never
had running water coming out of
taps to havo this supptied to it. This
includes etectricity and roads as well
ts telephone lines.

The above have been the main
aspects of life that the community
has cried out for. The minority are
concemed with tax breaks, micro and
macto economic strategies and gov-
ommeont spending which is fine, but
many times the motive behind these
concerns is usually self-ceotred. Our
naticn lain the proves of:
afuture gooeration where wealth
no longer be the right of only ane
colour, but our children, black and
white will be ontiied to achieve and
possces weaith as Nerniblans.

It ig an achievement when people
who could never have expocted
anything in the past can own a ploce
of ground to build a house. ft is an

achievement when al} our children
are free to attend any school and play
anywhere and do not have to be sub-
jected to carly morning raids in which
their parents are snatched from them.
Itis an achievement whea the entire
tation does not have to be gripped
by a demonic spirit of fear because
of draconian td Laws.

Asa son of the liberation strug-
sie and a citizen of Namibia as my
adopted country and as a minister of
the gospel of Jesus Christ and an ex-
UN diplomat, | would like to inform
the sogmen of our society which bas
never experienced the real brunt of
apartheid to desist from demonising
leaders who contributed immensely
to the freedom of the people of Na-
mibia. | sense an uncomfortable anxi-
ety among some of my indigenous
Caucasian brethren. I would suggest
that we al! embrace this county as
our collective responsibility and re-
spect the government of the day and
mike a better contribution. It might
be wiser for all of us to direct our
evergies and abilities towards sharing
land and skills to achieve economic
independence and satisfaction as we
compete with other states for markets
It might be safer torealise that should
one sink then we al! sink.

Lot us thank Almighty God for
a country that is the envy of many
countries In the world and let us
commit to Improve on our previous
echicvements. Allow me to express
great respect and admiration for
President Sam Nujoma and those
around him for silently teaching us
a lesson and having the foresight to
unite the nadion by having taken the
step he has taken. Mr President, 90
one can doay thet you are a great son

wi vi i great
legacy of hard work and high moral
standards wil] always Jive on and

come, Thank you sir for allowing a

ELECTIONS would be fairif those who vote elected
their representatives freely without any pressure or
any form of intimidation or character assassination?
I strongly feel that (the Swapo Congress) elections
were not free and fair.

The sacking ofoursistonary, capable Hamutenya
just before elections and smear campatens against
him by Nujoma on several occasions will never
make this election free and fair.

I would notexpect any rational person to belies ¢
what has been said about Hamutenya by those who
did so, including the President.

We expected the President to tell the natlon and
the Congress in particular that these are tested
comrades and the every body should make his/her
own choice accordingly.

He ts now claiming that the Congress has voted
in the interest of the whole nation. This ts totally
wrong. The congress has voted for Nujoma’s un-
Known interests.

If the entire nation was afforded a chance to
elect, | think the results could have been different.
The fact that Pohamba came with a pre-prepared
speech for the victory shows us that the results
were predetermined and the transparency used in
the counting processes is questionable.

We considered Sam Nujyomaas the greatfounding
father of our natron and indeed a visionary leader

of Africa but this was not so. Nujoma ts increas-
inely becoming a hardcore despot. He thinks he can
turn things around, ceteris paribus. Firing senior
ministers and indeed cabinet members who served
for decades ts a big embarrassment to him and to
the public.

Does this mean Swapo party does not have iter
nal disciplinary procedures to deal with unfounded
defaming allegations’? He keeps on referring to
others as imperiatists and forgets that he went to
the same imperialists to negotiate for Namibia's
independence.

His prerogative is beigg seriously misused. Some
ministers are so much preferred that firing them
would destabilise the country’s peace and stabilits
and dissolve the gains of our hard-won mdepend-
ence. This is also a sign that Swapo ts slowly but
surely disintegrating.

I think this was the wrong decision at the wrong
time. All the peace loving Namibians (perhaps ex-
cluding despots, opportunists, presidential remote
controls, political armatures, and power-hungry
hereby sympathise with Hamutens aand his deputy
We are already missing his intellectual leadership

did so, including the President.

We expected the President to tell the nation and
the Congress in particular that these are tested
comrades and the everybody should make his/her
own choice accordingly.

He is now claiming that the Congress has voted
in the interest of the whole nation. This is totally
wrong. The congress has voted for Nujoma’s un-
known interests.

If the entire nation was afforded a chance to
elect, I think the results could have been different.
The fact that Pohamba came with a pre-prepared
speech for the victory shows us that the results
were predetermined and the transparency used in
the counting processes is questionable.

We considered Sam Nujomaas the great founding
father of our nation and indeed a visionary leader

of Africa but this was not so. _Nujoma is increas-
ingly becoming a hardcore despot. He thinks he can
turn things around, ceteris paribus. Firing senior
ministers and indeed cabinet members who served
for decades is a big embarrassment to him and to
the public.

Does this mean Swapo party does not have inter-
nal disciplinary procedures to deal with unfounded
defaming allegations? He keeps on referring to

others as imperialists and forgets that he went to

the same imperialists to negotiate for Namibia’s
independence.

His prerogative is being seriously misused. Some
ministers are so much preferred that firing them
would destabilise the country’s peace and stability
and dissolve the gains of our hard-won independ-

ence. This is also a sign that Swapo is slowly but

surely disintegrating.

I think this was the wrong decision at the wrong
time. All the peace loving Namibians (perhaps ex-
cluding despots, opportunists, presidential remote

ELECTIONS would be fair if those who vote elected
their representatives freely without any pressure or
any form of intimidation or character assassination?
I strongly feel that (the Swapo Congress) elections
were not free and fair.

The sacking of our visionary, capable Hamutenya
just before elections and smear campaigns against
him by Nujoma on several occasions will never
make this election free and fair.

IAM writing in response to the
letter by Mr Alexactus T. Kaure
(How Namibia Supports Israel's
Palestine Occupation).

Mr Kaure has used the words
“blood diamonds” and “Methods
of Suppression”.

He can make good use of the
term “blood for oil” since most
world leaders are

so guick appease OIL RICH
Arab nations by condemning
any form of self defence by the
Israeli’s.

The same UN was very quick
to support the war in Afghanistan
after only one dreadful day of ter-
ror attacks on American soil.

The I{sraeli’s have tived with
people who send children with
suicide belts onto Jewish lands
for so many years, that people
like Mr. Kaure, like many others
may have become used to Jews
being killed.

Very few people notice the fact
that the Israeli’s have tried to
make peace with the “Palestin-
ians” even though the “Palestin-
ian” organisations all have one
thing in common: The objective
of The Destruction of the State
of Israel.

The Israelis’ have even called
these Arab migrants “Palestin-
ians”, knowing that there is no
such nation as “Palestinians”.
Any person (Christian, Muslim or
Jew !) who wishes to contradict
me on this can open his Bible
or Hadith and look for the word
Palestinian.

The closest word to this is the
Philistines, whom the Lord has
driven from His land to give to
the Jews.

I see that Mr. Kaure mentions
that Mr. Leviev is a “sponsor” of
Israel and “Jewish activities”.

So I guess that Mr. Kaure
does not like Jews or their tiny
State. It is difficult to understand
why people, some who claim to
be Christians, don’t like Jews
since the Messiah has a Jewish
mother, and his first Apostles
were Jews.

The Muslims’ Hadith give
a good idea of what the Arabs
(Umaral Khatibin particular) did
to the Jews and how some of the
Arabs aka ‘Palestinians’ came to
live in Israel.

The Jast two weeks has shown
just how far the EU and UN will
take their

double standards with the prob-
lem of terrorism.

These leaders are quick to con-
demn Israel for retaliating when
they are attacked by “Palestinian”
mititants.

The tsraeli’s then choose to
build a wall to keep the suicide
bombers out.

Then the oi! rich Arab world
is unhappy because the wall ts
very effective in it’s purpose of
protecting Jews, Christians and
other non Muslim “infidels”.

Therefore they took to the UN
and EU, convinces them that the
“Palestinian” suffering weighs
heavier than Israeli lives.

The biased UN then condemns
Israel for building the security bar-
tier. In this case the Israeli’s can-
not win no matter what they do.
From my Zionist Christian point
of view, the Israeli’s should first
seek their own security only then
the approval of Mr. Kaure, the
international courts, the UN the
EU and all others who approve
of oi] rich Arab nations who are
OK with killing of Jews.

rier. In this case the Israeli’s can-
nol win No matter what they do.
From my Zionist Christian point
of view, the {sracli’s should first
seck their own secunty only then
the approval of Mr. Kaure, the
international courts, the UN’ the
EU and all others who approve
of oil rich Arab nations who are
OK with killing of Jews.

not uninformed, opinion of Nadia

fied with Uutont Nujoma’s pres-
entation to the CHR in Geneva,
regarding the case of the Caprivi

Well, Nadia. like any other

your opinton as you did, so let me
do the same as follows:

How informed are you if you
label Cde. Paulus Kapia as one
of the “government officials”?
When last we checked Cde. Ka-
pia was a Party official. Nadia
rightly alluded to the need for us
to have “responsible and trans-

human-centred

development” She ts right but
which humans are being referred
to? Tome. only leaders to the con-
trary will allow sucha vision to be
derailed by a tew elements

such as Muyongo and his

After all when we talk of hu-
man-centered development dont
we mean the people with a sense
of purpose, thatof sustainable de-
velopment, like the ones we have?
Or, Dowe mean the detractors, Ms
Ihuhua? Surely we do not mean
to spend all the scant resources
on the rights of the detractors
rather than on the pensions of our
elderly or HIV-AIDs patients?
Do you really think if we spend
millions of $ this case, we will
elevate our human rights record

THE other day while looking
through a row of shirts on sale in
a shop in the centre of town,

I heard a young female shop
assistant, obviously feeling very
. uncomfortable, saying: “Just leave
me in peace”.

A man, also an employee of the
shop and probably her superior,
was following her around say-
ing:

“But you need to have fouror five
partners and you should be friendly
and nice with all of them.”

Obviously harassed, the young
woman walked off, the man still
talking in the same vein, trailing

along behind her.

Women need to realise that this
sort of behaviour is sexual harass-
ment and that they need not put up
with this kind of treatment from
colleagues or superiors.

They should report these men
immediately to their supervisors.

Men should realise that this kind
of behaviour is extremely uncom-
fortable and repressive for women.
When making any kind of compli-
ment they should pay attention to
the effect their words have on the
woman and stop when they see that
she is feeling uncomfortable.

In this ime of the HIV-pandemic

it is a serious threat to anybody's
health and life to have more than
one partner.

Also sexual harassment of this
kind may make life so uncom-
fortable for the woman involved
that she may quit her job. thus
contributing to unemployment,
poverty and in many cases to the
suffering of children.

Of course, sexual harassment
may also be perpetrated by women
upon men with equally negative
consequences.

The People Must Nominate

AS a peace loving Na-
mibian, | would like to
give MY Opinion ON OUT
democracy.

I would tke to start
with giving my advice and
Views to our democrau-
cally elected representa-
lives those are voting to
be nominated and those
who are representing us
now, more especially
members of parhament
(National Assembly and
National Council). Some
of our representatives do
not truly represent us.
because we, cilizens often

do not nomunate them in
the urst place. They are
representing thetr respec-
tive political party leader-
ship. Representatives who
have been sonominated by
their leaders, once elected
to office as parhamen-
tarians and councillors,
become subservient to
these leaders. Instead of
this representative being
accountable to the voters
they are only responsible
and accountable to their
political leaders who nom-
mated them. and who also
have the power lo remove

them. Therefore such
representauves Strive to
please their leaders often
iN patron-chent relation:
ships. Such relationships
are often maintained atthe
expense of the voters and
the general public. This ts
why once in their office,
most parliamentarians
and councillors may not
do what the public expects
them to do.

I know that these rep-
resentauves are not really
representing us because
cilizens are not the ones
who nominate them,

awe AlCl Ss Oe a Law

What! want toemphasis
is that: P can see that the
top-down appointment
of candidates is not a
vood way to go. Voters

have to nominate their

own representatives. Such
representauves nominated
by the voters themselves
know the needs of citi-
gens better than imposed
candidates do. Voters also
nominate a person who
they know and who they
trust. This system of the
top-down tashion of nomi-
nation must be stopped
and bottom- up fashion
must be introduced in the
political parties. | know
if we do this, our country

ye eet mM

Will be a good example to
other countries. Further-
more OUF representauves
will be accountable to all
ciuzens. The representa-
tives nominated by voters
themselves will work in
the interest of their voters
and not in interest of their
political leaders. because
they know that Hf they
do not work in the inter-
est of their voters in the
next election they wall be
kicked out. | wrote this
letter because | know that
we as ciuzens really need

AS a peace loving Na-
mibian, I would -like to
give my opinion on our
democracy.

I would like to start
with giving my advice and
views to our democrati-
cally elected representa-
tives those are going to
be nominated and those
who are representing us
now, more especially
members of parliament
(National Assembly and
National Council). Some
of our representatives do
not truly represent us,
because we, citizens often

do not nominate them in
the first place. They are

representing their respec-

tive political party leader-
ship. Representatives who
have been sonominated by
their leaders, once elected
to office as parliamen-
tarians and councillors,
become subservient to
these leaders. Instead of
this representative being
accountable to the voters
they are only responsible
and accountable to their
inated them, and who also
have the power to remove

them. Therefore such
representatives strive to

the general public. This is
why once in their office,
most parliamentarians
and councillors may not
do what the public expects
them to do.

I know that these rep-
resentatives are not really
representing us because

who nominate them.

What! want toemphasis
is that: I can see that the
top-down appointment
of candidates is not a
good way to go. Voters
have to nominate their
ownrepresentatives. Sach
representatives nominated
by the voters themselves
know the needs of citi-
zens better than i
candidates do. Voters also
nominate a person who
they know and who they
trust. This system of the
top-down fashion of nomi-
nation must be stopped
and bottom- up fashion
must be introduced in the
political parties. I know
if we do this, our country

will be a good example to.
other countries. Further-
more our representatives
will be accountable to all
citizens. The representa-
tives nominated by voters
themselves will work in
the interest of their voters
and not in interest of their
political leaders, because
they know that if they
do not work in the inter-
est of their voters in the
next election they will be
kicked out. I wrote this
letter because I know that
we as citizens really need
to be represented.
