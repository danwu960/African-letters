This is not simply be-

Young People try
drugs after having ob-

Ina society inundated
with illegal and legal

The problem is that le.

Properties, few People
think of tobaccoasatrue
drug. After all, nicotine.
the addictive component
in tobacco, does not al-
ter the perception of the
user. Smoking a ciga-
rette neither changes an
individual's personality,
not impairs his every-
day functioning.

Smokers purchase
Cigarettes legally in a
Society that permits the
advertising and Ppromo-
tion of tobacco, but the
legality of tobacco can-
not diminish its danger.
Cigarettes are composed
of substances that not
only are addictive but
also contribute to the
deaths of people each
year.

Internationally, ef-
forts are being made to
reduce the demand for
drugs and therefore to
work on prevention, but
the drug problem is not
the substance on its own,
it is the Personality of
the person and the con-

“yhext ip which ‘he or she-
lives.

The context created by
the schotisznd:edtice

ents, the workplace, rec"
Teational area and the
whole community.

On the one hand, the
YOUN person is receiv-
ing messages to Say no
todrugs, on the other, he
observes adults abusing
SOcially accepted drugs.

Even authorities
sometimes do not fulfil
their obligations, espe-
Cially when it comes to
applying laws tegulat-
ing the use and sale of
alcohol and Cigarettes
while they further ben-
efit by imposing taxes.

Young Perople are
being taught and shown
contradicting values.
We must therefore be-
come aware of the re-
sponsibility we all have
inthe fight against drugs.
