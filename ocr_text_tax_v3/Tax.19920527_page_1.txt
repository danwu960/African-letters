other countries said ‘we want
to be like Basibia”’.

And that is how one small
nation began to change the
world.

The jet outcry

IT has never been part of my
culture to engage myself in
public debates which are being
over-emphasised for political

ain.

In the face of the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an R80 mil-
lion jet for the Government
and officials of the Republic
of Namibia, I was faced with
several questions which I could
not help to answer.

I fully concur with the fact
that our country faces numer-
ous problems, some short term
and others long term. Take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane.

Now the question is whether
it is true that those ‘Muyon-
gos’ who presuppose that the
R80 million could have been
better spent if used for relief
programmes, are more sensi-

tive to the realities in Na-
mibia? If so, how far back
have they (Muyongos) been
so critical about the way in
which taxpayers’ money has
been spent for the purchase
of things such as Casspirs and

Mirages by their regime, the
former interim government?

Or, does Muyongo want us
to believe that the money mis-
used on the purchase of war
material at the time of their
rule was less than R80 mil-
lion? And was it not taxpay-
ers’ money?

This country has inherited
a debt which it has to repay
due to the misuse of funds
and the criminal war which
was imposed on our people.
Again, does Muyongo want
us to accept that the drought
and other social evils in our
country today are new hap-
penings? I assume not.

Unemployment, hunger, to
mention but a few, are the
legacy of the past history of
the country. Even at the time
of successive colonial regimes,
the problems were there.

As these problems did not
prevent them (the Muyongos)
from purchasing wanton war

‘materials which ran to bil-
lions of Rands which this
country is left to repay today,
likewise, should these pre-
vent the legitimate govern-
ment from purchasing a plane
which will enable the Presi-
dent and other Government
officials to maintain contacts
with the outside world for the
benefit of the people of this
country?

‘ Bven if the plane were not
purchased, could there be
someone who would come
, up with a formula which would
serve «a8 a means through

which the R80 million would
have been better spent?
How many foreign compa-
nies have been offered op-
portunities to invest in this
country? And the shocking
result is often that instead of
employing Namibians, they
either bring in their own
employees (foreigners) or they
simply amass huge profits for
themselves and transfer the
monies out of the country after
having paid the locals poorly, -
something which is tanta-
mount to exploitation.

The logic of buying a plane
for the State is explicitly clear
and it must not merely be
opposed for the sake of op-
posing.

Mr Muyongo, sir, being in
the opposition does not nec-
essarily necessitate you to op-
pose every undertaking of the
government. It rather requires
you to show the people of this
country that you have the abil-
ity to be an alternative gov-
ernment in the future - some-
thing which your colleague
Dirk Mudge and his Party,
the DTA, have already been
proved wrong by the major-
ity of the people of this coun-
try.

Confusions

FROM my point of view as
an entrepreneur, I do nofagree
with the statement of the new
Namibian National Chamber
of Commerce and Industry
(NNCCT) in connection with —
the plane for the President
(The Namibian, May 12). I
got annoyed. How is it pos-
sible that such an orgamisa-
tion which claims to repre-
sent the private sector, can
make such confusing utter-
ances?

I went to the NNCCT to dis-
cus this matter and to ascer-
tain whether the newspaper
report was a true reflection of
the original statement. This
was confirmed and I was told
that the comment was also
meant to challenge people and
to elicit a reaction.

During my discussion with
the General Secretary of the
NNCCI I then raised the fol-
lowing points:

They believe that the R80
million invested in the plane
will bring about more bene-
fits than disadvantages. But
the NNCCI cannot support
that statement with a compre-
hensive evaluation of the facts.
That should have been done
to avoid the perception that
the NNCCI is flattering the
government.

Without doing its home-
work, the NNCCI should avoid
to criticise publicly its own
members or organisations eli-
gible for membership.

They accuse the private
sector of not having addressed
its responsibility where in-
come-generating is concerned.
Thus the government needs
the plane to look for sources
