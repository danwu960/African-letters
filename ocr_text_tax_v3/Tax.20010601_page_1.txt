Taxpayer’s Point Of View

to.
IT is disappointing to note that government officials and a better deal elsewhere, my answer would be:

are disrespectful of society’s concerns. My major
reason for ing to Mr Hamufungu’s riposte
and the implications of this intervention is based on
the assumption that lack of resources impedes effec-
tive operation of the Namibian Police Force. If this is
the case it is imperative that this action and any future
endeavour [not limited to Nampol] be carefully ap-
praised. Let us be objective and look at things in
perspective for once, this is our country it is our
future.
Zimbabwe is currently politically unstable and the
most unstable economically in the region if not on the
x continent. What quality practices and examples can
Namibia adopt from Zimbabwe? I am convinced that
Namthbia's young democracy is extremely vulnerable

to Zim’s governance style, certainly the Jatter prec-
lg edent 1s no good example for any peace loving and
er developing nation such as Namibia.
c- The uming of this training venture is politically
My unacceptable, economically not feasible and adminis-
» tatively impossible. If you argue to the contrary you
te

are welcome to please prove your point.
In response to Mr Hamufungu's question on cost

1. Training of Trainers - this can be # cost cutting
exercise, the same course can be offered either at the
Police Training College or any other training institu-
tion in Namibia. This is what I call a longterm cost-
effective investment.

2. How about redesigning the curriculum for the
Diploma course offered by'the Polytechnic to include
your taining needs?

3. Instructors could be flown into Namibia— should
not cost a taxpayer more than N$100 000.

If you are still convinced that the initial decision is
the best, present the taxpayers and this nation which
hopes to benefit, with an investment appraisal report
clearly indicating real cost and benefits.

The interest in this case is sparked because I’m a
taxpayer financing government expenditure pro-
grammes, and I have a right to benefit from any
rational, rather than irrational government action, and
lastly I fear that illustrious sons and daughters of our
police force will copy disrespect for human rights and
the rule of law from Zimbabwe.
