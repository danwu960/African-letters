On Income tax

THE badget debate is still on
in our National Assembly so
that my suggestion conceming
the paymem of income tax
remains relevant.

It was quite ironical to hear
Finance Minister, Dr Herrigel,
making remarks in his budget
speech about closing the loop-
boles in the system of taxing
perks which salary carners
receive.

Who gets more perks than
the Honourable Minister and
his fellow members of the Na-
tioual Assembly and they do
not even pay tax on their large
income.

This is what ! find Lacking in
the socalled debate about the
budget in the Assembly. Peopic
are themselves on the
Finance Minister about a sup-

posedly progressive budget,
instead of addressing the bum-
ing problem that they, like the
Pharisees in Biblical times,
‘bind heavy burdens, hard to
bear, and lay them on people's
shoulders, but they themselves
will not move them with their
finger’' (Mathew 23:4).

I ask simply and humbly that
our National Assembly Icgis-
late that they themselves, who,
after all, car more than any-
body else, pay income tax on
their salaries and perks.

It is no excuse that it is re-
garded as tradition worldwide
that members of governments
donot pay taxes. Iris a mark of
true leadership that those in
government should not require
of their subjects anything which
they are not prepared to do or

ve themselves.

Let Namibia become an
example to governments the
world over tha! we are a true

democracy even in this respect.
L ‘s only when the minister of
finance of a country and his
peers in government are sub-
ject to the same obligations as
other citizens of that country
that they will be sensitive to
the problems and needs of their
fellow citizens.

I hereby invite other con-
cemed Namibians to take up
this debate in this newspaper
so that it will hopefully be-
come a concem for our gov-
emment.
