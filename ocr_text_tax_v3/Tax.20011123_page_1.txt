VAT Vendors Beware

COULD you please wam all registered
Value Added Tax vendors to beware of the
latest absurdity that the Receiver of Rev-
enue has come up with.

If your VAT payment is late or your
cheques bounces, then they enforce sec-
tion 68 (1) of the Value Added Tax Act
which states. “A person who fails to pay
any tax payable under this act on or before
the due date for payment shall be liable for
the payment of a penalty which ts the
greater of an amount of N$100.00 foreach
day during which the tax payment remains
outstanding” etc. This happened to aclient
of mine who had to pay an amount of N$
1100.00 but forgot to sign the cheque that
he used for the payment. The cheque was
therefore refused by the bank and the Re-
ceiver claimed inexcess of N$13000.00in
penalties as well as N$ 1800.00 in interest.
Well, this is where they are wrong.

If the officials from the Revenue offices
would take the time and effort and carry on
reading section 68 of the same Act, they

will notice under the same section, namely
subsection 2, it states quite clearly and I
quote: “The penalty imposed under sub-
section | shall not exceed the amount of
unpaid tax"’, unquote. This means that when
a person owes N$1 100.00, the maximum
penalty may only amount to N$1 100.00.
Therefore, if a taxpayer fails to hand ina
Nil return, then no penalties may be im-
posed.

I would be grateful to your newspaper if
these facts could be taken up with our
Receiver of Revenue and our readers ac-
cordingly informed. | wonder how many
taxpayers have already paid amounts in
excess of what they had to. The responsible
officer at the Receiver is a Mr. Kenny
Clocte, I attach copies of the relevant,
sections of the Value Added Tax Act,
2000. (Act 10 of 2000).
