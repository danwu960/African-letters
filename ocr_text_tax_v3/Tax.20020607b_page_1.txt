Public Must Take Part
In Opposing Monopolies

1 WAS fav

general public when the Navy ‘Comment rian

Bill was debated by stakeholders. “Wednesda 29

May 2002. on nesday 29

I would hereby wish to appeal to the reading
Public to actively take part in this opendiscussionon
being come isso urgent and long outstanding - that
MTC petition for Telecom Namibia Ltd and

How long have we been subject to unjustified
monopolies in this country - being Telecom and
MTC. I believe the second cellular licence will also
be awarded this year or early next year.

It is a requirement of the World Trade Organiza-
tion (WTO) that all telecommunications markets be
open for competition by the year 2004, which is just
around the comer. Our Government in the Telecom-
munications Policy and Regulatory Framework pub-
lished in September 1999 recognised the fact that
compeution will come for sure.

Now at the workshop of May 29, nearly three
years after the Government policy was published.
the Legal Adviser of Telecom Namibia Ltd.
pleaded for another exclusivity period for voice
telephony.

My very strong plea goes to the Hon. Minister
Theo Ben Gurirab and the regulator, being the
Namibian Communications Commission, to 20
ahead and open the telecommunications market for
competition. Refuse to let the mighty Telecom Na-
mibia Ltd. once again bring to a halt the telecommu-
nications restructuring process that was started in
1992.

Ltd has had a period of ten
iiey had enough time to
ae in a free fair and

open market

On the other hand MTC has had a exclusivity
period for seven years and has basically covered the
main towns of Namibia with access to mobile te-
lephony

The actual crux of the matter 1s we want to have
the right to chose the network we want {0 use. The
last few years saw a series of price Increases. SOME
over 200 per cent on the pretext of rebalancing of
tariffs. How do you rebalance tariffs by increasing
the price of local calls and keeping the prices of Jong
distance and international calls the same. Surely
something 15 very wrong tf rebalancing 15 done in
this fashion.

By the way and in conclusion, Telecom Namibia
argues that t will experience harm when the market
is opened for competition. Surely you wall lose
customers to newcomers but did you think that you
might even score increased income from intercoa-
nection and of leasing some of the public switched
telecommunications network (backbone) to other
operators. Another free tip for the Telecom Namibia
Top Managements to get nd of three quarters of the
managers and appoint more workers - then you
would not have to worry about compention.

After all Telecom Namibia Ltd. 1s an asset of the
State and in other words 1s public property and paid
for by the money of the taxpayers

Congratulations to Willem Bekker and all others
who worked on the Draft Communications Bill -
with such a documenton the table Namibia can once
again take the lead in the region.

Viva competition in the telecoms market
