Dear Ms Lister

-YOUR ‘Political Perspective’L
published on August 1 was a
remarkable piece of writing. There
are many points on which one
could comment; only one 1s,
however, of sufficient importance
to require a response. .
Neither I nor any part of the
consultancy service ‘favour’ one
Minister over another. This would
be wholly inconsistent with our
charge from the Cabinet. The con- —
sultancy’s task is to make the goals, —
aspirations and achievements of the
Transitional Government known in
circles of influence abroad. We do
this to the best of our ability, with,
I believe, some degree of success.
