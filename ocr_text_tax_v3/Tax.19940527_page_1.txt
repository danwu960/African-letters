Let The Government Feel The Heat

TO my surprise I heard
that the Namibian Goy- .

ermmenthas again given
cash tothe ANC amount-
ing to more than a mil-
Jion and more shock-
ingly, the PAC, I’ve
heard, had a share...

Why can’t the people
in governing live up to
the reality of our Na-
mibian situation? Every

now and then they are’

repeating very silly mis-
takes one after another.

There was the original
one million dished out to
the ANC (probably to
buy a political stand on
Walvis Bay from them).
This was followed by the

_ on Ss Ue

controversial purchase
of the plane and now

~ again big cash was dished

out to the ANC .. what
for? After all the ANC is
not a poor organisation.
It is probably the richest
liberation organisation in
Africa and maybe even
in the world. American,
andeven local

(SA) multinational com-
panies have filled the
ANC’s coffers already.
What is most strange
and abeurd about this
socalled donation is the
fact that the dollars were
popped o just days be-
fore the -ctions when

been concluded.

Thus if the ANC (now
the majority party in the
transitional government)
has to spend the money
of mostly poor and un-
employed Namibian tax-
payers, it will be for de-
velopment programmes
such as housing, educa-
tion and health, while we
Namibian taxpayers con-
tinue to live in poverty
with few housing facili-

vs

ties, notenough schools.

Tamnot really making
a big fuss about this
money, but no matter
how little it may appear
to those in government
this money ciould have
been quite enough to buy
six months supply of an-
tibiotics for rural hospi-
tals, or build 100 stand-
ard houses in Katutura
or elsewhere or provide
work for ex soldiers etc.

Like.

But this kind of squan-
dering of our money hap-
pens because:

* those in government
are too comfortable (de-
spite their rapidly dimin-
ishing accountability to
masses) almost to the
point of arrogance and
total irresponsibility;

* they don’t seem to
feel enough pressure by
the people who elected
them to power,

* there is no viable,
effective opposition in
parliament;

* almostno one within
the party, whether in gov-
ernment or not, seems to
have the will, ict alone
the commitment, to in-
form the party leaders
they could lose their jobs.

As aresult of this and
many other reasons, mis-
management of govern-
ment funds and other
malpractices are likely
to continue in the future
unless something is done.

And we can almost rest
assured that change will
not be initiated by the
government itself, but

only if we subject them
to an increase in political

Workers, stu-
dents and everyone else
should unite and form a

lenge these politicians.
They must feel the tem-

next election I hope wie
will lead our vote to them
and not give them a
power base so that at any
ume the taxpayers must
be able to demand ac-
countability in return.
