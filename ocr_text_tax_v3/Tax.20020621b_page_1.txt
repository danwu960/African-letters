Tam notsarprised at
stand of the Minister on
problems experieaced b
Unam, and the financial
predicament it is in, when
the following are happen-
ing at Unam.

* There is to equal treat-
ment of Namibians vs
non-Namibians as far as
salaries, condition of serv -
ice are concerned even
though many have the
same qualifications.

* New appointees are
better salaried than expe-

nienced colleagues.

* There are redundant
top management and sen-
ior administrative staff.
which should be viewed
as ineffective and ex-
ploitative tegarding the
current scenario.

* Costly intemational
trips are undertaken and
there is no evidence of
any benefit to the univer-
Silty.

* Foreign colleagues
receive relocation fees in
cash including spouses
and children, gratuity,
Cartage of household ef-
fects at the beginning and
ead of contract, 100 per
cent housing loan etc.
Thus hiring non-

Namubians is more expen-
sive in the long-term than
adjusting the offers made
to Namubians.

* There are huge differ-
ence between salanes of
academic and administra-
tve staff. The universi-
ty’s functions should
change from teaching to
administration.

* Too many sectional
heads. How can one be a
head in a section of two
staff members?

Some of the other prob-
lems include. Furniture
bought for expatriates is
not re-used or auctioned.
We are led to believe it is
stored; the Unam village
for expatriates is a waste

of money: the faculty of
education is too big with
too many departments;
there is duplication of in-
effective security services.

The operation and ex-
istence of Unam Founda-
ton is questionable. There
are redundant sports and
cultural officers, redun-
dant Heads of Depart-
ments, Deans, Professors
and highly qualified aca-
demics for a mostly un-
dergraduate university
with few masters students,
with one to two doctoral
students.

Most academics are
doing consultancy work,
teaching part-tume at the
Polytechnic etc. If one

teaches only 5 hours a
week, there should be lot
of time to earn extra
money. The number of
students does not justify
number of hired experts.
The outsourcing of print-
ing is about N$4 million;
staff development is adis-
mal failure at Unam. Al-
mostall departments, fac-
ulties are ‘foreignised’.
Generally teaching is of a
low standard. Role and
management of the Uni-
versity farm is dubious.
Even farm workers em-
ployed as Unam employ-
ees working for individu-
als are paid out of Unam
coffers.

Logically, how can

Namibian taxpayers
moncy be used to further
the interest of a few, and
feed the salary and ex-
penditure bill of non-na-
donals, or be misappro-
priated and mismanage-
ment by a few individu-
als? Why are we afraid of
afull scale external probe?
Are we afraid that mis-
takes made will be uncov-
ered and individual im-
ages tarnished? If one
makes a mistake, ac-
knowledge and recufy it.
I'm of the opinion it will
make us grow stronger
and be much more effec-
tive, rather than denying
errors made which will
eventually result in disin-
tegration of this univer-
sity. .
There is a brain drain at

who are joining Govern.
ment for better paid jobs,

Other tertiary institu.
lions Ike Namcol, Col-
leges of Educanon, Poly-
technic of Namibia, donot
have this image and are
better managed than
Unam. Contract employ-
ees from outside our bor-
ders are aging academics,
mostly retired or retiring.
We need recently gradu-
ated energetic experts with
new ideas and vision for
educational reform, cur-
niculum and instructional
design and the will to
teach. The Faculty of
Education should be
wholly Namibianised be-
cause of the pool of
Namibian professionals
involved in education,
from which lecturers cag
be drawn.

Worried, UNAM
