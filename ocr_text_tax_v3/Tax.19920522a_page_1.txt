Not a waste

PLEASE allow me space in
your esteemed newspaper to
air my views on what seems to
be a controversial issue - the
purchase of a Presidential jet
estimated to cost R80 million.

I would at the outset like to
state that acquiring a plane for
the country is in no way a
waste of resources consider-
ing the fact that this plane is
going to be used for transport-
ing the President and his en-
tourage to various parts of the
globe to canvass for much-
needed assistance that our young
and fledgling nation will re-
quire from time to time.

On top of that the jet will not
be used for the President's
private purposes but rather for
purposes beneficial to the
development of Namibia and
its people. Obviously when the
President is not travelling the
aircraft will be used commer-
cially, thus bringing in addi-
tional revenue for the state. As
opposed to the chartered plane
which is costing the govern-
ment and the taxpayer, if you _to
like, thousands, ifnot millions lo
per day? Therefore the pur- VC
chase of an executive jet is a |
cost-saving exercise rather than ™
an unwanted and unwarranted ¢0
expenditure as some of our ev
countrymen tend to believe, ._—se

Painstakingly, those oppos- _fes
ing the idea are mostly those he!
responsible for the misery and me
poverty of Namibians and ap.
suddenly and ironically are for
today ‘championing’ the ‘cause’ _ tot
of the disenfranchised com- _ bel
munity hence the unofficial buy
spokespersons of these people. I
This is sheer hypocrisy. There den
are those who maintain that tim
the acquisition is untimely pla
because of the drought situ- mal
ation in our country. Well and
good. That the country is
drought-stricken is a reality too
obvious to be missed even by
the Government. To be realis-
tic the Government is in no
way ignoning this problem and
instead it has announced emer-
gency measures in a bid to
address and thus arrest the situ-
ation!

Concomitantly, to my own
understanding and belief, the
President had to charter a plane
to go to Iran - to name but one
country - where he won a deal
to supply the Iranians with beef
in exchange for oil which (the
beef) otherwise could have
flooded the local market, thus
forcing the drought affected
farmer to sell it below market
prices.

Ina nutshell, lam just trying
10 appeal to my countrymen
and women not to criticise
cverything left, night and centre
Just to let themselves be heard,
but should rather be objective
and constructive,

I realise that there are those
who have their own political
agenda (perhaps a hidden one)
and who will try to frustrate
the efforts of the new dispen-
sation in order to win some
political votes, but acquiring a
plane which is obviously going
to serve the national interest in
for example taking ‘us’ to the
top of the world in search of
assistance when in dire Straits,
1s Something worth justifying.
