Judicial System ‘Sucks’

IF we were to spend our time worrying
about justice or the judicial system in
our country, which clearly sucks, |

Prisoners, in jails throughout the
country, are being treated like persons
who are not guilty of acrime. On top of
that they are given lenient sentences by
the courts.

The judicial system maintains that

which really baffles me. They (prison-

cause they know that the death sen-

Of course rehabilitation pro-
grammes in jails are good and are
welcomed. However, the prisoners
must pay their dues for the crimes tt

prisons - sometimes while out on bail.
This does not make sense.

There are people in this country who
say that the high crime rate is caused by
unemployment. Can anyone prove that
rape is caused by unemployment? The
sooner we dispose of that ill-founded
idea the better. Let us stop this ten-

crime through unemployment. Not only
do we find excuses for the culpnits, we
also have to support them with our
hard-earned tax money.

The criminal disease is alive and well
in Namibia so let us combat it by find-
ing its cure. Let a team from govern-
ment, private sector and individuals
make Namibia a crime-free society.

who came up with the idea that
