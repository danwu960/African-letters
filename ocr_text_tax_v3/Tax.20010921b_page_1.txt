An Economic Puzzle

THERE have been some rather puzzling/troubling
economic developments over the last decade or so:

1. Could someone please explain to us ordinary
folks where the ndiculously low official inflation
rate comes from? How can the inflation rate be a
mere “8,5 - 9%". if over the past few months some
prices have gone up by as much as 37%??

Some examples:

* Electricity - up 13% from July:

* Other rates & taxes - up 1O% since July

* Post boxes - up 37% recently;

* Telephone tariffs - up t 30% this year.

* VAT has been taking a whopping 15-30% extra
on each purchase since Nov 2000 - and some
businesses have used this to inflate their prices even
further.

Bank costs are becoming exhorbitant.

* Food prices and other commodity prices also
keep rising all the time, not to mention car prices.

2. Whereas up to 10-12 years ago people were
rewarded for paying cash by being offered dis-
counts for prompt payment, things have since been
tumed completely upside down: Now there are
massive discounts for opening new accounts and
buying big amounts ata time on them - creating an
increasingly debt-ndden society. People’s inability
to pay back their debts on ordinary commodities
like clothes and shoes to price increases - which of
course ure absorbed by those who regularly pay

their debts and those who pay cash.

This holds good for countries and their govern-
ments too, with some countnes carrying ever-in-
creasing debt loads that they will never be able to
pay back - with the result that in the end these same
countries could be forced by their creditors into
deals currently unacceptable to them. such as hav-
ing to accept and store atomic waste for example.

3. In our moder economy. spending seens to be
regarded to be more positive than saving - arecent
newspaper headline read: Fears of increased sav-
ing! There was a time in South Africa when the
populace was encouraged to save - and in those
years the economy was strong and healthy.

An cconomy based on borrowing und spending
may be to the advantage of big business - but what
about the ordinary person tn the street? Where can
we ordinary folks “store” our money without it
losing its value? Interest rates have dropped so
much that they are even lower than the “official”
inflation rate.

Maybe we should keep our money under the
mattress again Well, maybe someone out there will
be able to prove me wrong in my gloomy analysis
- Lam looking forward to it!
