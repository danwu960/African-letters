‘Time To Account’ +

THROUGHOUT the country I have

get. This is an unacceptable state of
aftaiss fora country with only close
to two million people, but rich with
natural resources and raw materials.
The past year has seen alarming in-
creases in the pnces of food, clothing
and fuel.

The poor and needy people should
not be only be fed during festivals,
Christmas gatherings or at one or
other occasion. taust be

done on a regular basis. In fact there book.

is no sense in feeding a hungry per-
son only for one day.

One major concern in this inde-
pendent country 1s the increasing rate
of unemployment. During the elec-
won campargns the politcal office
bearers Inst yob creation high on their
campaign promises, but from the
looks of it this 1s forgotten.

Sadly. in the past year unemploy-
ment has conunued to escalate and
matriculants struggic to enrol for
further studies and our and
skilled professionals flock out of the
country and the already jobless have
lost hope of ever earning a decent
living wage.

The health sector in general 1s also
under a huge strain. The hospitals
and climics fall into disrepair with

ft 1t Tha

little or no stock.

AIDS is killing and destroying
mostly the poor and the Government
must make this a priority and not a
favour. Rape, murder and robbery is a
growing trend in this beautiful coun-
try. It is shameful to see the names of
top political bearers, as well as top
Government officials involved in the
committing of crimes.

The robbery of innocent Namibians
and tourists must by all means be
stopped and culprits be brought to

The Police as well as Government
vehicles must only be used for the
practical purpose they are assigned
to Finally, the exploiting and wast-
age of taxpayers money must be
stopped. Itis shameful to see that only
about six per cent of the total popula-
ton hives in luxury while the remain-
ing 94 per cent in poverty.

We trusted you, our political office
bearers and top government officials
to look after our precious resources
and money, not for you to enrich your-
selves and become fat cats. You will
have to account one or other ume.
Remember we are very concerned and
frustrated.
