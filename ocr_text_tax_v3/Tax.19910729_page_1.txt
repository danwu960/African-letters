road improvements will knock
time off the tedious journey to
the airport”. Are we, as a de-
veloping country, with a des-
perate shortage of fundamen-
tal facilities such as schools
and hospitals, really able to
justify spending mullions of
Rands merely to relieve a few
privileged people of a little
frustration?

It is interesting to look care-
fully at exactly the sort of time
that is going to be saved by the
road improvements. For the
forty lalometres from the
Windhoek city limits to the
airport, the youmey takes 30 |
minutes at an average speed of |
SOkm/hr. Were improvements
to make it possible to dnve at
an average speed of 100km/hr
the joumey would be reduced
to 24 minutes.

A much cheaper solution to
the problem of getting to the
airport on time would be to
leave home six minutes earlier
than usual.

I am sure thal the argument
will be raised that a widened
road will also be a safer road;
that in the long nin there will

be fewer fatalities. Although |
| don't believe that this is even
necessarily going to be the case
(three lane roads have in many
cases been shown to be the
| most dangerous of them all) I
feel that improved safety is not
a good enough justification in
any case. At the riak of sound-
ing callous, ] would say that
the number of lives that could
be Riviedl rough improved
