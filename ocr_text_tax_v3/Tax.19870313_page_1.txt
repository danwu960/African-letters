Objections

ACCORDING to a report published
in the Republikein of March 6 1987,
interim government Minister, An-
dreas Shipanga, ‘sharply criticised’
and expreseed his ‘disappointment’
about certain statements the Vicar
General of the Roman Catholic
Church, Father Bernhard Nor-
dkamp, had allegedly made during
an address given at a youth seminar,
which, again according to the report,
is said to have been organised by the
Council of Churches. The report
relates to what Mr Shipanga is alleg.
ed to have said during a meeting of
the National Assembly on March 5
— 1987.
Mr Shipanga, acearding to the
report, bases his claim about what
the Vicar General had said during
the youth seminar held at Dobra, on
a letter by an unidentified “Win-
 dhoek student” which letter was
_ published in the Windhoek Observer
af February 28, 1987. The “student”
alleges, inter alia, that Father Nor- |
| dkamp had said that “law andorder }
| are sin”. For the purposes of this |
statement it is sufficient to state that
the letter contains further very
serious distortions and outright un-
truths, It represents nothing but a
very ill-considered attempt to smear
the Roman Catholic Church and to
‘discredit the Vicar General, whose
commitment to bringing about
| jugtios with peace in a truly Chris-
tian society in Namibia ia well
