As issues are unfoldin now inci
ground to believe that Unam should re-examine ee neing
its enoire system of resource management and academic
excellence in the interest of Saving the reputation of the
only University in the country, failing which a lasting
damage wili continue to tamish the image of its future
Products in the job market.

The financial crisis in which Unam finds itself has been
public knowledge for quite a while and should have found
administrative solution in good time. Attributing the
financial quagmire to students’ failure to Pay University
fees is an unconvincing argument which only accentuates
the deep-seated inadequacy in the system's Capacity to
manage. Failure to collect funds from the students is itself
a telling example of administrative incompetence.

Itts a time-tested rule that the survival of any organiza-
tion depends on the effective planning and management

as well as institution of a functioning internal control of
available resources. Uncontrolled misuse of resources by
staff for personal gain can result in skyrocketing expenses
for the institution without any retums accruing to it; this,
I believe, is one of the cases with this institution of
learning right now. I would like to Specifically refer to
University staff members engaging in a diversity of
consulting work for pure personal benefit.
They utilize the insttution’s facilities, blow up tel-
ephone and Internet bills looking for information around

the world for
consultants,
Let me leave the academic and overaj) administrative
facets for open discussion in later times and only focus on
Providing a hint on the handling of a Component issue,
namely the conduct of assigned researches for the ult-
mate good of all institutions Partnering with the Univer.

Projects they would like lo work on as

. Silty and in the interest of the University’s own name. The

following procedures may need to be heedfully observed:

a. Projects Or research topics coming from sources
within and without the country ought to be directed to a
Central Unit Possibly a Research Centre in the Univer-
Sity.

b. The Central Unit should be charged with the respon-
sibility of identifying rescarchers to constitute a team and
Organising needed material resources to undertake the
Study. Once the Study is underway, the next stage of the
Centre’s responsibility is to co-ordinate the conduct of the
research and ensure that the Outputs meet the satisfactions
Of client institutions. The Centre and by implication the
University should completely assume the challenges of
Producing usable research outcomes.

c. Pecuniary gains derived from the research exercise
ought to be shared between the University as provider of
facilities and the researchers as the brains behind the
Outputs in an internally agreed upon system of apportion-
ing.

d. Institutions looking up to the University for the
conduct of purposeful studies should go through the
Central Unit of the University or the University itself to
ensure that the assignments are associated with authentic
responsibility.
