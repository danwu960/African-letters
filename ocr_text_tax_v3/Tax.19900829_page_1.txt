On diamond theft

I WISH to react to CDMs campaign
against diamoad theft.

I would like to make it categon-
cally clear that this campaign amounts
to cheap propaganda on the part of
this company.
CDM said recently that ‘‘employ-

oes developed a philosophy that dia-
mond theft wa’ legitimate and there-
fore not morally wrong as the com-
pany itself was perceived to be *steal-
ing’ diamonds from the Namibian
nation"’

[want to tell CDM that the people
of Namibia are sick and tired of
“mmulti-nationals. It is a wellknown
ufect that CDM and other companies
4 @ratioed hand in hend with racist South
=}, AEsca to exploit, oppress Namibi-

Therefore the company commut-
ted untold unforgivable and unfor-
gettable contraventions such as over-
mining and transfer pncing.

Furthermore, de Beers, the owners
of CDM, have created a number of
subsidiaries that held onto mining
and prospecting nghts and the fees
paid to them are set against tax.

One subsidiary, the Manne Dia-
mond Corporation, leased to CDM
several prospecting and mining ar-
eas along the Atlantic Coast.

Itisclearthat this deal was made to
avoid paying tax. This is a grossly
unpatnotic act and amounts to eco-
nomic sabotage in our country. It is
also designed to prevent economic
growth.

In theory CDMs operations were/
are overseen by the socalled Dia-
mond Board of SWA, which advised

the South African Administrator

General. However, he himself dis-

covered that the Board nover had’
physical control of the diamonds.

All inspections and supervisions
were done by CDM, mostly white
South Africans, who parcelled up the
diamonds and despatched them to
Kimberley, where they were valued
by de Beers officials and not Namibi-
ans.

The Goverment must not be misled
by CDM into thinking that it is its
employees who are ‘stealing’ the
diamonds.

If diamonds are being stolen, per-
haps it is also whites who are not
searched. The security men who work
at the gate on the Namibian/South
African border are whites, and some
of them live at Alexander Bay. They
are not Namibians and they often
search only blacks while whites are
given the green light.

It is also an insult that the people
who control entry into Oranjemund
are ¢x CDM shop assistants, mostly
females from South Africa.

Lastly, instead of CDM asking its
employees to hand in stolen diamands
from 23 to 29 August, they them-
selves must hand in diamonds which
are kept in Kimberley and London.
