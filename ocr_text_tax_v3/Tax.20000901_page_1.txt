looks increasingly as if
Namibian busi and the
Ministry of Finance will
not be ready for VAT and
we are heading for an al-
Tughty mess.
Consider the following:
- The design of VAT
retums drives the changes
that businesses need to
make to their systems and
computer programmes.
The VAT returms are not

available yet and Revenue
has now yet indicated when
they will be.

- The Outstanding VAT
Act amendments deter-
mine how entire sectors of
the Namibian business
community will be taxed.

DEesses Commence their

Over VAT ‘Crisis’

> The registration of
VAT vendors will only
commence in eamest once
the Public Education and
Awareness Campaign for
VAT has reached small
business in all the towns of
this widespread country of

Process at thet ime. How
does Revenue intend to
Process the large number

Of registrations that they
will receive barely one
month before November
27? And when do they
envisage supplying these
vendors with their VAT
registration numbers to put
On their stationery, cash
registers and computer sys-
tems?

- The announcement
Mentioned above does not
mention whether or not the
VAT returns will be avail-
able tohand out at the semi-
nars. When will these busi-
nesses receive them and
how does Revenue expect
them to timeously change

their systems and train
employees at that late
stage?

- How comfortable 13
Inland Revenue that their
Own Systems and staff will
be ready in three months’
time? Indeed, one would
expect them to be com-
pleted right now so as to
dea! with all the unex:
pected issues shortly be-
fore and after implemen-
tation date. The grapevine
has it that they are not
ready.

- How comfortable is
Inland Revenue that sys-
tems and staff at borders
will be ready in three
months’ time? The grape-

Ose rtone,

13

vine has it that they are
nowhere near ready - not
how and notin November.
Revenue insisted of giv-
ing itself and the business
SeCtor six months in which
lo prepare for the imple-
mentation of VAT and this
was wnilten into the VAT
Act. Thatis commendable.
However the amendments
yet to be made public re-
quires this preparation pe-
riod to recommence. Ac-
cording to the press an-
Nouncement it won't. But
let’s face reality. Let's
lear from countries like
Zambia, Australia and
South Afnca and make a
00d job of implementing
VAT. Let's give ourselves
more time.
