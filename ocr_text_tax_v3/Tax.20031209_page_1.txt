What Are The Govt’s Priorities On Land?

THE debate concerning
Namibian’s land hunger goes on
and will continue to do 50 as long
as politicians have the remotest
chance of gaining support from
this. The debate takes place on a
platform of highly charged
emouons leading to threats of
forced farmland occupations,
which in tum causes concem about
aZimbabwe-style situation arising.
The fact that we have elected union
members as well as elected
members of Parliament stating
quite openly that they will ignore
the Consutution and the rule of law
by taking the Jaw into their own
hands seems not to have even
caused a sur here. Quite amazing
thatacounty which tells the world
how proud itis of its Constitugon
for which so many lives were lost
and which tt will defend by all
means can become so selective in
its cntcrsm or rather lack thereof.

The fact that Swapo finally
ordered the unions to discontnue
the folly is of litle consolation
when the people of Namibia are
prepared to accept such lawlessness
and irresponsible behaviour
withouta mummur. The only voices
of concem we hear ime and ime
again are those of The Namibian
newspaper and the NSHR.

Here are some thoughts
conceming this issue.

A person who squats or one who
does not own land but who chooses
for whatever reason to live off that
land has no responsibility towards
that land. Once however he owns
land, this situation changes
drastically. All of a sudden the
availability of water for him, his
family and animals becomes his
responsibility, the availability or

not of grazing takes on different
dimensions, no longer can he trek
with his animals to some other
place in order to be able to graze his
animals by surreptitious means.
Fencing, inoculation of animals,
relations withneighbours, the effect
of drought, if there exists a decent
house on the farm, its upkeep as
well at that of established gardens
or orchards; all become the
responsibility of this person, a
responsibility which he has never
before had and which no one has
taught him to manage, let alone
given him the means to pay for.

Aspiring farmers wil! also have
to pay salaries and wages;
eventually taxes and repay the loan
plus interest.

The situation is made even worse
when all the support systems are
not in place and the chances of
success are from the very beginning
remote because the area of land
given is too small ever to be viable.
Can you imagine this person's
discontent when he finds our after
three or five years that he was not
adequately prepared for this venture
and that the land has as a result of
various factors such as overgrazing
and drought become useless,
necessitating more and or another
piece of land.

Even though studies have shown
that the most pressing needs in
Namibia are poverty and the lack
of employment, the Government
chooses to priontise the issue of
land. This sensitive issue of land
gives our political leaders a useful
and emotonal platform from which
they Cy to gain support for their
own political ambitons. It would
be far more difficult to obtain that
support if there was no or less

poverty and employment was of
litle concern.

We constantly hear talk about
expropriation and resettlement at
the expense of more innovanve
ways of trying to address this very
real problem. A foreign farmer's
land, which has been targeted for
expropriapon, will in most cases
already be developed and the owner
will have athis disposal some ifaot
lots of money.

So, instead of going to the trouble
such as litigation, having to meet
the requirements of the Foreign
Investment Act, or risking the value
of farmland being drastically
reduced by going to the mibunal in
the event chat an agreement cannot
be reached on the price for the
farm, why not approach Mr
Foreigner and suggest to him a
partnership with a Namibian?

Instead of going to all the trouble
set out above and exposing our
countrymen to the challenges of
establishing what already exists
albeitin another's name, and paying
for what is already there in the
form of not only land but water,
fences, vehicles, pumps, generators
etc, the partnership can be
structured in various innovative
ways and would not cost
Government a fraction of what it
would cost to litigate, buy the farm
and develop it.

My experience has been that
foreigners most want space,
freedom, clean air and the
possibility to hunt. All of this we
could continue to make available
andat the same time accommodate
a serious Namubian farmer and
quench his thirst for land. Another
advantage is
that the

foreigner spends litde ime on the
farm. A really daring butinnovative
way of obtaining land 1s to invite
foreigners to buy farmland on the
condition that they enter into
partnerships with Namibians on
setterms. Many a Namibian farmer
too would only be too happy to
receive an interest free loan in order
to restock his or her farm in
exchange for agreeing to a
partnership with a Namibian.

A pnonty now is to find a way of
using the best skills available to
move the unemployed and even
the unemployable into the formal
economy in order to address the
real problems - unemployment and
poverty. To provide aspirant
farmers and communities with
access to land andessenual services
fails to address the real problem if
they cannot afford these services
on a sustainable basis.

Rather than conunue with theu
attempt to gain political support by
misguiding the unemployed, both
the unions and the Goverment
must realise that the immediate
goal must be to give Namibians
back their dignity, which is
something they foughtand suffered
for, by giving them access to
employmentandtorelieve poverty.
We should follow the example of
South Africa where vastsums have
recently been budgeted specifically
for job creanon measures, rather
than spending huge amounts on
the personal aspirations of some
politicians. What really are
Government's pnonties?
