NOW that five years
have passed since inde-
pendence Namibia still
resembles a country
where a small percent-
age of the chic own the
major wealth of the
country. Inthe long term
this will not only stifle
the development of the
country but will also cre-
ate major unrest among
the masses who have
hoped fora much greater
share of thts wealth.
Without getting into
politics, it is expected
by the outside world that
this country grow by its
own efforts and notsim-
ply rely on the ‘charity’
of foreign countries.
Some years ago Nel-
son Mandcla suggested
a wealth tax for South
Africa. It met such hos-
tile opposition from
those who today still
control much of the
wealth of the country.
What was forgoticn here
was that quite a few
countries, including
Germany, have a wealth
tax as part of their nor-
maltaxation system. The

wealth of that country ts
much more widely dis-
tributed and one could
actually question why
Germany needs a wealth
tax, other than to help in
the development of the
former GDR.

Would tt be unreason-
able for individuals or
companies resident in
Namibia for over 10
years, and whose assets
exceed N$SO0 000, not
to share a bit of their
wealth, by means of a
wealth tax? How about
aone percent wealth tax
ON amounts between
N$500 000 and N$!
million and one and a
half per cent on wealth
exceeding the above.
The elite have made their
money here, and this
small share of it can be
utilised solely tohelpthe

less advantaged
Namibians (maybe co-
operatives) to build up
their own industry and
help establish a social
security system in Na-
mubia. Itshouldcertainly
not be used for the en-
richmentof government
officials, waste and a
bloated. inefficient civil
service.

An expert organisa-
tion composed of inter-
national accounting
firms could be asked to
adnunister this tax.

The wealth tax should
be applied to the chite on
a world-wide basis to
prevent export of capi-
tal by those wishing to
evade this tax. on com-
panies and individuals.
It 1s one reason why
Namibia needs to de-
couple tself from the

rand, with its own cur-
tency now in place.
Morally i 1s only fair
that the masses can ben-
efit. It should lessen
crime and create more
stability.

To attract foreign in-
vestors and entrepre-
Neurs these persons or
enterprises they estab-
lish in Namubia, should
not be subject to any
wealth tax for the first
ten years.

A‘tax holiday’ should
be granted for several
years for those willing
torisk their foreign capl-
talandcate employment
in this country.

There are other coun-
trics who have this sys-
tem and experts will
need to advise govern-
mentto whom tax “holi-
day’ privileges should

be granted. It can only
be for those investors in
essential categories and
not everyone.

With foreign experi:
ence of wealth taxation,
I see no reason why it
cannot be applied to
Namibia. South Africa
will be no shelter for a
world wide wealth tax
system.

Non resident investors
and entrepreneurs
should likewise be
taxed, possibly after five
years, for their wealth in
southern Africa at Icast.

Finally property taxes
should be based on ap-
Praised market values
and not on ‘municipal
valuations’. Such ap-
praisals should be con-
ducted every few years,
and owners have the
right of appeal to any
valuation.

These taxes will have
very little impact on the
average middle class
population. What do the
readers think?
