"antublo. our baer to sell com-
petitively at international levels, and
‘ to: attract foreign investment. This
may well be true. But, attheendofthe
day, the issue is often a political one,
and, with international acceptance, a
‘Swapo government may well be ableto

of trade with bodies such as the EEC
and various governments, including
the so called ‘Third World’ countries.
It is, of course, also true that the deci-
sion to be made is essentially one of
deciding what social coats we are
prepared to pay for the sake of ‘develop-
ment’. And at as has already been in-
dicated; we do not believe that that
price has to be very high.

Itis alsoperhaps, here that indepen-
denttrade unions might havearoleto

terests. But, and this is, of course,
again, a controversial issue, we may
have to steer clear of ‘ultra-leftist’
trades unions. Not that there is
anything wrong with such trades
unions in principle. But the idea that
blocking, say, the sale of Namibian
uranium, will bring the international
capitalist system crumbling down, or
export revolutions to other countries,
seems, in the current climate, at best,
idealistic, but could involve tremen-
dous social and economic cost on the
part ofasmall nation that hasalready
had more than its fair share of suffer-

3. DEMOCRACY: Mr. Geingcob is
reported in ‘The Namibian’ to have
said that ‘There cannot be democracy
only at the expense of the majority, and
a Swapo government will extend
democracy toa!

world of ‘pereetroika’ and ‘power tothe

strong for reactionary forces to

portance that may, perhaps, have tobe
placed upon responsible media and a
comprehensive educational system.
Freedom of the press, and open govern-
ment are principles that we all sup-
port, but they must be balanced
against society's interest in informed,
as opposed to misinformed, decision
making. Certainly, whilst the racist
regime in the south prevails, these in-
terests might have to be carefully
balanced. What we could certainly not
afford to do, is to let working people suf-
fer so much for independence and
freedom, and then extend the existing
life of concrete reality in a camouflag-
ed form.

IN SUMMARY: It has not been the ob-
jective of this brief article to criticise
what was said, or not said, at the
Lusaka conference. Indeed, the con-
ference was a significant and welcome
political development. Rather, our at-
temp(thas been merely to restate and
keep alive the debate as to the road to
socialist ‘development for Namibia,
after independence. In view of the
debate raging in ‘socialist countries’
at the moment, tothe extent that some
leading personalities are reported to
have questioned the wisdom of the
revolutions that took place there at all,
as wel] as welcoming extreme right
wing political leaders toexpound their
obnoxious philosophies to their people,
it is important, even more so for us in
Namibia, toopen up as many areas as
possible for debate - now.
