Hard-hitting questions from a Khomasdal taxpayer —

IN THE LIGHT of the fact that our
Coloured schools have been in the
news lately, I have a number of

questions.

Myself and other parents looked
forward to seeing what the pass
percentages were of matriculants last
year. Now J must read in a local
newspaper that, according to the Ad-
ministration for Coloureds, these
figures are a secret. How on earth can
the percentage passes be kept a
secret?

As a Coloured taxpayer, 1 appeal
to Mr Billy Phillips, Chairman of the
Executive Committee and member
charged with Education, to make

known this figure, as well asthat of .

the Standard Eights for last year.
Recently there have also been
many reports that the Coloured
schools in Khomasdal are full and
that. hundreds of students are sent
home, According to Mr Koopman,
Director of Education, the situation
is to be ascribed to the following:

* many parents have moved from
rural areas to Windhoek

* parents whose children were last
year in South Africa, are now at
schools in Windhoek

* Coloureds in South Africa, who
by virtue of present conditions there,
send their children to Windhoek
schools.

These reasons are correct, but Mr
Koopman forgot to mention the
mostimportant one, namely the fact
that children from Katutura are
streaming into Khomasdal schools.

Lam not asupporter of apartheid,
not in the least. ] am saying these
things in the light of the apartheid
kingdom (AG 8) which the Labour
Party of Mr Dawid Bezuidenhout
and Mr Billy Phillips and company,
accepted, and according to which
they govern.

If people accept a certain govern-
ment system, then they should
govern according to the letter and
spirit of it, and not merely in accor-

dance with those parts which suit
them.

In accordance with Proclamation
AG 8, the personal tax of each tax-
payer is paid to the second tier
authority of the population group of
which beis a member. A certain por-
tion of that tax is used for education.
lam sure that the greatest percentage
of the Coloured budget is spent on
education. In other words, the bulk,

of the taxpayer's money is spenton —

education.

In the light of this, Mr Phillips
should reply immediately to the
following questions:

* Why are hundreds of black
children allowed in our schools.
while our own children are sent
home?

* Do the parents of black children
pay taxes to the Coloured
Administration?

If the answer is yes, then I would
like to know what these parents pay.

Once again 1 wish to say that | am

strongly opposed to any form of
apartheid but I want to prove that AG
8, which Mr Phillips and Company
accepted, is not implementable, and
our concern is because our children
are losing out educationally.

In @ radio interview, Mr Burden,
Rector of the Khomasdal training
college, said that 40 percent fewer
students had been accepted at the
College this year. I further hear that
most of the students come from
South Africa and other ethnic
groups.

1 call upon Mr Phillips to give us
these figures too How many
students are from South Africa and
other ethnic groups? Then I want to
know the costs of running the Col-
lege per annum.

Mr Phillips must also tell us why
it Is necessary to have an apartheid
college near to the Academy? Is it a
question of his imitating his white
apartheid brothers?

Year after year we must hear how

teachers are imported from South
Africa and placed in senior posts,
while our own teachers with equal or

gher qualifications are overigok-
od ovite respect to the imported’
teachers, ] must say that soma.of
them are the weakest teachers, who
have said they could not get johs in
South Africa, but here they are given
senior posts.

1 want to ask Mr Phillips why he
has made our schools, the rabbish
heap of South African teachers?

The only way out of this govern-
ment system (AG 8), which is
table tono one but the leaders of
Coloured Labour Party, is to scrapit
in its totality. Let the true political
leaders, and not the ‘yes-boss” types
and political opportunists, work out
a system which ts acceptable to the
people of this country.
