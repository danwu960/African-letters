Government Expenditures Should Not Be Decreased

I] WOULD like to air my
views concerning the re-
cently tabled budget. I beg
to differ with the econo-
mists, tax practitioners
and academics who sug-
gest that the Government
should reduce or cut back
on its expenditures.

}am not happy with the
idea because Namibia is
a developing country and
the Government should
increase its expenditures
in order to address social
evils such as unemploy-
ment, poverty reduction,
HIV/AIDS and boost the
infrastructure.

Instead of decreasing
the expenditure, Govern-
ment should look at better
methods of collecting
more tax revenue in order
to finance its expenditures.
The time has come to
look at the way the tax
office ts conducting its
business of collecting tax;
because it1s not collecting
much needed revenue.

The Government should
ensure that the tax office
is restructured to meet
the goals:

1. Establish tax offices
in all major towns.

Currently, there are
only four tax offices in
the country - Windhoek,
Walvis Bay, Oshakati
and Rundu. Taxpayers are
travelling more than 200
kilometres to reach the
tax office. This situation
creates non-compliance
from taxpayers due to
costs involved to reach
the tax office.

2. Introduce tax audit

This is necessary to
prevent tax evaders and
to enforce compliance.
There are taxpayers who
have not yet paid tax or
submitted their tax returns
since Independence.

3. Salary income taxed
separately from business/
farming income

The income tax act
should be amended to

avoid salaned individuals
from deducting their busi-
ness/farming expenses
from their salaries. This
will stop the refund of
money salaried individu-
als are receiving from the
tax office every year.

4. Increase the tax
base

The Government should
introduce capital gains
tax, donation and estate
tax etc.

5. Establish an autono-
mous revenue authonty

There is a dire need
to have people who are
business minded to run
the affairs of the tax of-
fice. But with the current
situation, it is difficult to
attract qualified personnel.
The best way is to com-
mercialise the tax office in
order to avoid the current
management crisis.

6. Revenue estimation

The tax office should
be held responsible and
accountable for any short-

fall in revenue esumation.
Each revenue office in
each town should be given
targets of tax revenues to
be collected annually.

7. Training of tax of-
ficials

The tax officials must
be trained and exposed to
better tax administration
inthe SADC or elsewhere
in order to change their
attitude towards work and
to be made aware of the
importance of collecting
more tax.

8. Strategic plan of the
tax office

Currently, the tax office
has a mission statement
enshrined in the taxpayer
charter but there are no
objectives and strategies on
how to achieve the mission
statement. | wonder if tax
officials know how much tax
revenue should be collected

during a tax period.
