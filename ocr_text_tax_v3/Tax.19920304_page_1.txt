ing, he survives on rumours,
false expectations and promises.
1 am convinced that the NUNW
are to be blamed to a great extent
for this sorry state of affairs,
because they in turn survive on
re-active action and every minor
labour dispute is blown out of
proportion by them - but where
are the achievements?

I appeal to the NUNW to
please become pro-active and to
start working with the qualita-
tive assets of your members.
Stop concentrating on the
shameful issues only, because
this makes your organisation
what it is - a shameful one.

Thanks to Mr Mubita for in-
troducing the Namibian leaders
to their people in such frank and
open (although sometimes bi-
ased) manner, because it helps to
understand certain problems this
country is facing.

Still imbalances

1 WOULD like to register my
concern on the matter of Gov-
ernment houses. The state of
affairs conceming official ac-
commodation for civil servants
cannot continue as in the past.
Something must be done now.
The Honourable Minister of
Works, Transport and Commu-
nication, you are the only one
who can sec to it at this stage that
our people get what we deserve.
Justice must be practiced with
the allocation of accommoda-
tion for all civil servants. Blacks
are also civil servants and can
also live in these houses now
(which was not the case in the
past). Some believe it is still the
case because they serve as key
figures in these socalled housing
committees, most of which are
not really in the interest of the
majority of civil servants and are
unacceptable throughout the

wry

ie

country.

Comrade Minister, 1 am con-
vinced that you, as a freedom
fighter, have not forgotten the
imbalances in the rural areas that
are still as they were in the past.
Windhoek inclusive, there are
some houses mainly reserved for
white colleagues (obviously
those in a good condition) and
certain houses fit for blacks
only.

Comrade Minister, we would
like your Ministry to see to it that
the structures according to
which these housing committees
are established, be reviewed, so
that black observers be replaced
and whites be transferred to a
rehabilitation centre.

We need civil servants in our
towns who can re-shape the
Status quo.

Officials in Keetmanshoop
even claim that some houses are
reserved for up to three months.
One wonders for whom? Offi-
cials in Rundu, Oshakati, and
Ondangua and other smaller
towns confirm their situation is
similar. I asked some black civil
servants why they didn’t apply
for these open houses after they
had worked more than six years
for the government? And their
response was that they were told
there were no houses available.

If there is no response from
the Ministry concerned, I am
prepared to provide the Prime
Minister's office with the facts
so that he can come to our res-
cue. We don’t necessarily just
want to replace white adminis-
trators with black ones, but we
would like to see the colonial-
minded whites leave.

I also hear that whites are now
moving from old-fashioned
houses to newer ones and this
seems to be a strategy planned to
Maintain the gap between the
privileged and the deprived.
Renovations are done on certain
houses at the expense of the tax-
payers and on an unfair basis,

T hope people in the Fegions
will be encouraged by this letter
to fight the injustices continu
in the different structures of our
government. Colleagues, Guard
against injustice and save the
government to save the nation,

Student bursaries

1 AM very disappointed by the
Ministry of Education and Cul.
ture. I am one of those students
in the University of Namibia
who wants to study further both
for myself and the development
and building of the Namibian
nation.

I have applied for bursaries
from the Ministry of Education
and Culture. They sent me a let-
ter of inquiry in which they
asked me to provide them with
Std 10 results, but at that time the
results were not yet released.
They then told me that they don’t
have the course I have chosen
although they had sent applica-
tion forms and booklets to the
school which stipulated the
course in question. Until today |
have had no feedback. I am at
present attending lectures but !
don’t know whether I will get the
bursary or whether I will have to
leave. My parents are very poor
and cannot afford the fees. The
fees, including hostel and meals
plus courses, are about R11 000.
Not many people can afford to
pay this sort of amount.

We students of the Academy
urge the government to consider
this matter. About two-thirds of
the students here don’t have
bursaries and are still waiting for
answers because they have ap-
plied.

We will go on strike unless
something is done.

UNHAPPY STUDENT
