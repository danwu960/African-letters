It is difficult to understand how a

Cabinet minister can simply accept
serious allegatioe without further
verification. Mr Shipanga’s failure to
check his facts is even more frighten.
ing in view of the extremely wide ar.
bitrary executive powers which are
vested in him and his colleagues in
the Cabinet of the interim govern-
ment by virtue of numerous socall-
ed security laws, which would clear-
ly require the greatest measure of
restraint and responsibility. These
laws not only offend againat fun.
damental human rights, but also in-
vite serious abuses of due process and
the Rule of Law.

It is most disturbing that Mr
Shipanga, at the taxpayer's expense,
and protected by a statutory immuni-
ty against possible legal action,
repeats unchecked allegations by an
obecure letter writer and then, on the
basis of those slanderous allegations
proceeds to ‘sharply’ criticise a senior
and respected Priest of the order of
the Oblates whose dedication
towards the protection of Christian
values in this territory can hardly be
questioned. :

Mr Shipanga has chosen Father |
Nordkamp as a target of severe |
criticiam. At the same time Mr |
Sr ipengs however chooses to remain

silent about the Police’s admission
under oath in the Heita trial present-
ly before the Windhoek Supreme
Court, presenting a picture of brutal
violations of tha most elementary
human rights and an alarming |
disregard for law = soa — yy the
