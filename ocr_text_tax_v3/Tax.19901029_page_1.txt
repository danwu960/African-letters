NYANGO (ZAMBIA)

On car abuse

of Wednesday, October 24, in which
he/she implied that the abuse of
government vehicles was the *‘order
of the day’’ in the past and that it
went unchecked and unnoticed.

The implication in the letter was
also that the abuse of government
vehicles is no worse than in the past
and that the numerous complaints
arise out of resentment that ‘blacks
are driving huxury vehicles’.

I can tell Mr/Mrs FPP that in the

in which I work there

was (and still is) vory strict control
ver the use of State vehicles.

J WAS amazed to read ‘FPP’s’ letter

The use of a goverment vehicle as
transport to and from home was (and
stillis) stricy forbidden. The idea of
using a government vehicle for a
shopping tnp as one frequently sees
nowadays was completely out of the
question.

When I was shopping on Saturday
October 6, there were at least four
‘D...T’ Toyota Landcmuisers parked
in the Wemhil car park. Whatever
Mr/Mrs FPP might think, this type of
blatant misuse of our (as taxpayers)
property did not happen in the past,
and certainly not in the recent plus-
minus five years.

I am really not concerned with
whether the current offenders are
black or white, but [ am concemed
that taxpayers such as myself are
paying for the use of government
vehicles in flagrant violation of regu-
lations, which for some reason are
not being enforced in certain govern-
ment departments.

I appreciate that many civil ser-
vants are not able to afford to buy a
car for transport to and from work,
and that public transport in Wind-
hock is woofully inadequate.

Would it not then be a better idea
for departments to look at the possi-
bility of a bus/minibus collection
service instead of using countless
fuel-guzzling four-wheel drive ve-
hicles to transport civil servants to
and from their place of work?
