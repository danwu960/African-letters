On married women

1 WOULD like to raise some

questions concemung the treal-
ment of marned women.

We married women have
problems with the way in which
we are treated by the state
services. I am married with
four children, my husband does
not work at all. My salary is
meagre. I went to apply for
medical aid but was told that if
I would like to apply, I could

. apply in my own right, but

Thay” 1 0¢ renee eens

could not register my children.
T was told that the children
should be registered in their
father’s name. I do not know
how he can do s0, since he is
not .

I beg those in authority to
consider some of these prob-
lems and act accordingly. |
also find some state regula-
tions are very rigid and inflex-
ible.

We as democrats in a socal-
led democratic society should
allow some exemptions. It is
not good enough to say that
you are married and have to be
taxed heavily even though your
husband is not employed. They
must bear in mind that women
are sometimes the breadwin-
ners.

the situatigel thepe18 vety similar
to what NamibiaAuffered in
the past. AfterAVorld War I,

Slovenia, a former Austrian
colony, vo/fntarily joined Yu-

what happened in the then
German colony of Sguth West

Africa. But just likg Namibia,
Slovenia was only exploited
by the central goyermment and
