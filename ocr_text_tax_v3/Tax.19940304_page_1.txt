Kaokoland reapectively.

Walvis Bay of 1878 is
not the same as Walvis

I appeal now to all

land concemed in Na-
mibsa to refresh the land
return demands senously

OVITOTO

The true leader

WITH regard to an arti-
che in The Namibian of
February 22 on the visit
of Abraham Ndumbu to
the Ivory Coast and
Gambia with the Presi.
dent:

Mr Kamehozu 1» sur-
prised by the visit but his
wormes are not shared
by all Namibians. Why
are you troubled by this
visit? Is at because
Ndumbu went with the
President?

On your question as to
what criteria were used
to select Ndumbu, what

or his trip,

cigner and hes-the right
spedgoy the fruits of free-
dom as a tampayer.

You and the Ministry
do not like the man be-
cause he speaks the truth
and pomts out what has
been done wrong. If stu-
dents want to affiliate
with Swapo that is their
right because democracy
exists in Namibia.

Swapo is the founder
of Nanso and it is impos-
sible for Nanso to break
away. Those who broke
away should have re-
named their organisation
and not kept the name of
Nanso.

Do not intimidate
those who want to sup-
port Swapo. I know you
arc trying to. stop
Ndumbu but your or-
ganisation is not in the
interests of all students,
only some of them, and
you and the Ministry of
Education are trying to
put students on the
sirects.

Ndumbu's visit and
tnp with the President
Shows that he 1s the true
leader of Nanso and this
is why his opposition 1s
complaining.

Is this
hospitality?

WE ALL know that Na-
mibia has been strug-
giing to put up a
respectale national soc-
certeam. Most of us who
have kept track of the
national under 20s per-
formance concur that
with the addition of two
to three more players,
this should be the team.
