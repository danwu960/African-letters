Quo Vadis?

According to news reports around
25 000 people are benefiting from an
emergency feeding scheme The
Department of National Health and
Welfare, and private welfare organiza-
tions, like the Red Croes are involved.
While having sympathy with
hungry people, and supporting the ef-
forts to help, we have to ask ourselves,
‘“Why are these people starving”. The
following problems are contributing to
the problem viz:
A) Population Growth:
The annual population growth hovers
around three percent. Fifty percentof
the population is 15 years or younger,
and therefore unproductive. Between
5 to 10 percent are retired and no
longer make a contribution. Present.
ly only 20 percentofthe population are
gainfully economically employed, and
of this group, one quarter works for the
State. The balance 20-25% are either
subsistence farmers or unemployed.
The population growth outstrips
food production, housing resources,
schooling, Health services and pod crea-
tion. As @ result the population
becomes poorer and poorer, and the
economically active group smaller in
proportion. It is always tempting in an
effort to redistribute wealth, to heavi-
ly tax this group. Care must however
be taken not tokill the goose that lays
the golden eggs.
B) Drought:
Namibia isa semi-desertcou ntry and
droughts are part of life. The problem
arises when the odd few good rainfal]
years are taken asthe norm and no pro-
vision is made for the inevitable bad
years in nature's cycle.
C) Farming Methods:
Farming methods are sometimes very
destructive, especially in the com-
munal areas. There, no rotation graz-
ing isimplemented and very little con-
trol is exercised over stock numbers.
Traditionally the number of cattle iB
a symbol of wealth, irrespective of their
condition. Owners are alsooften loathe
to sell their cattle, even in times of
drought, with resultant destruction of
grazing and death, as witnessed a few
years ago in Kaokoveld. The result is
the same as in the Sahel region in
North Africa. Man has totally upset
the dalicate balance of nature for short
term gain, with longterm destructive
results, . | |
