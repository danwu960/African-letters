THE Government of the
Republic of Namibia wel-
comed the gathenng on
press freedom, attended
by media practitioners
across the globe, which
took place in Windhoek
on May 3, 2001. The Gov-
emment further regards
the meeting as having

been a valuable forum to
address the challenges
facing the media in south-
em Afnea, as well as an
Opportunity to investigate
better co-operation be-
tween tt and the media,
especially regarding mat-
ters such as an improved
flow of information.
Generally the necting
proceeded positively, with

exchange of views and

Opinions. It ts therefore a
great pity that, at the same
Ome, certain quarters also
used this meeting as a plat-
form for indulging in ar-
tacks upon the Namibian
Government and -
1ng from the positive spirit
which prevailed at the
Conference.

In this context, the Gov-
emment of Namibia takes
stong exception to the
recent accusations lev-
elled against it by the so-
called ‘Co-ordinating
Committee of Press Free-
dom Organisations’ of
‘violating elementary
Principles of press free.
dom’. The Government
further took exception to
the headline carried by
The Namibian which

reads, “Rights groups tum
Spotlight onto the Govt".
This headline sought to
Convey the sinister im.
Pression that the govern.
ment of Namibia was put
tn the dock. We Teject any
000n to portray the con-
clusions of the conference

as having indicted the
Government.

The accusation that
President Nujoma had
used the conference to
berate the press, the ad-
vertising ban on The
Namibian newspaper, as

well as a ban on foreign
Journalists covering other
Cvents apart from the Con-
ference itself, are used as
fodder to queston the
Namibian Government's
commitment to freedom
of the press.

Tt is clear from the
Speech of the President,
that he used the venue to
raise issues of importance
vegarding the proper role
of the media in a demo
Cratic society. It appears,

the reaction of this
group, that to raise issues
