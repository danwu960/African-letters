Workers Party Needed -

OTTILIE Abrahams raised crucial issues in her article
entitled 'To occupy or not to occupy? Is that really the
question?’ (The Namibian, November 28).

We are in agreement with the article that the interests
of all Namibian workers, not only farm workers, should
be addressed. We also concur that the focus cannot only
be on the land question since this is not the only social
question. There are many other questions such as the
hunger question, the unemployment question, the
housing questions etc that should be resolved. In the
context of Namibia having the highest level of income
inequality in the world these questions are matters of life
and death for the working class.

Ottlie’s article however raised other issues that should
be debated. In our view for example, though we would
understand the symbolism of Khoisan farmers, for us it
does not matter if the farmer is white or black because
the real question to pose is what the purpose of production
is? Is it for profit or people?

There are many black farmers in Namibia but this
does not ensure that poverty is eradicated or that
exploitation would be stopped Because these black
farmers act hike their white counterparts, i.e. the purpose
of farming tor them is to make a profit. The question of
the skin colour of the farmer is a secondary issue. We
can give all the farms to black Namibians tomorrow but
this does not mean that we would end poverty and
exploitation.

The choice is simply, are we approaching the land
question from the point of view of making a profit or to
satisfy the needs of people? Every policy option should
be evaluated according to this basic yardstick of whether
itis serving the profit mative or people’s needs. In other
words is ita neo-liberal policy or an anti-capitalist
policy? These are the two basic options today.

We fully agreed when Ottilie suggested that “the

capitalist system never takes kindly to the handing over
of the means of production to the workers unless it is
forced to do so”. As long as the so-called right to private
property exists we will not make any significant social
progress in this highly unequal country because the elite
(white and black) will always violently defend its ill-
gotten privileges. Ottilie unfortunately contradicted
herself when she wrote later that “if we are social
democrats at heart, let us bring about this social revolution
in a democratic way, through the ballot box, and let us
pay the taxes needed to enable government to run a
social revolution ina democratic way, through the ballot
box, and letus pay the taxes needed toenable government
to run a social welfare state. Relying.on the ballot box
versus forcing the capitalist system is profoundly
different approaches i.e. reform versus revoluuon!

The social democratic project died with the demise
of Stalinism. The Swedish model, which was the prime
example of the social democratic project for many
histoncal reasons that do not even begin to apply to
Namibia, does not exist anymore.

The only actin town at this historical momentis the
(neo-liberal) capitalistone. Social democrats today are
really neo-liberals at heart.

There is alsono parliamentary road to social revolution.
The Chilean experience in 1973 represented the end of
the ballot box approach to anti-capitalism. Capitalism
will never willingly give up power. It will have to be
forced to do so far away from the ballot box. Only the
well-organised mass action of the Namibian working
class can put us on the road to an anu-capitalist society
in which all the social questions could be addressed. We
require a workers party immersed in the trade unions to
begin to do this in Namibia.
