Don’t disappoint us

I WAS surprised and saddened to
tead in The Namibian on Friday of
the heavy-handed and rather clumsy
attempt by Mr Emvula to impose on
the Namibian Broadcasting Corpo-
ration a discredited and discarded
east European style of trumping up
support for govemment.

Mr Enmvula, it doesn’t work as
those previously in power in eastern
Europe and here in our own country
have leamed to their cost.

Moreoever, would it not be more
appropriate for the NBC, as a state-
financed media, to be setting the
pace by demonstrating the constitu-
tional provision of freedom of the
media! Obviously if our widely re-
spected and beloved President issues
a statement, in a free media it should
be given due weight because of the
importance of what the head of state
says rather than because of an in-
struction from above.

But let the media make judge-
ments on the balance of what makes
news which can't effectively be es-
tablished by a set of rigid rules. Those

judgements by news staff can be
debated and criticized by both NBC

be dealt with in aconstructively criti-
cal manner. A government able to
cope with that and responsive to it
will gain for itself respect and ac-
claim nationally and intemationally.
Let it become part of our new politi-
cal culture.

The chiefs at the NBC could takea
look at Article 95(k) of our country’s
constitution and undertake the pub-
lic service of encouraging the ‘‘mass
of the population...to influence gov-
emment policy by debating its deci-
sions'’. Let ordinary people, too, speak
through the electronic media per-
haps by introducing a series of dis-
cussion programmes. Mr Emvula
should devote his enthusiasm to such
a project rather than trying to secure
entrenched spots for ministers on
news bulletins.

Many people hope that the NBC
will establish itself as a media genu-
inely serving the best interests of our
people. Mr Emvula, please don't
disappoint us.
