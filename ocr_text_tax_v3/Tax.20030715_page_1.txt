Open Letter To President Bush On AIDS

| AM sending a copy of this to
President Sam Nujoma of Nambia,
one of the countries that desper-
ately needs some help with this
immense public healthissue. Ihave
spentaconsiderable amountof ume
in Namibia and have friends there,
including a black woman science
teacher who recently wrote in part:
“am out in Kavango and the
problems here are so acute that...
/am spending time with 6-year olds
..in one household... 36 orphans

with the grandmother whose own

children have all died of AIDS.

... Donors do not come this side of
the country and remain in Windhoek
only. The decision-makers have no
clue or do not care. It hurt to see
these young girls pregnant be-
cause thas is the only way they can
feed their families.”

I am embarrassed and annoyed,
Mr. President, that my country is 50
belated in proposing funding
for substantive action on AIDS in

c

Afnca. J would rather have the cost
of half a dozen Trident II missiles
(which are made in my home town
and paid for with MY tax money) be
spent on building health

But! ameven more annoyed and
saddened that the religious zeal-
otry that permeates your adminis.
tration has contaminated this Ieg-
islation by denying money to sex
workers, and to anyone who has
advocated abortion and requiring
that 1/3rd of the education money
be spenton advocating abstinence.
Those views deny the reality of the
situahons.

Please cradicate these conditions
of funding and promote the deliver-
ance of the AIDS aid to where itis
most needed... NOT to holding
meetings in air-conditioned offices
about how the money should be
spent and then buying Ford Broncos
to go out into the harsh environ-
ment to tell people not to have physi-
cal contact. The survivors of those
36 children, if any, will reed
my grandchildren's world. Wi

Year bodies and little edu-
cation they can hardly become good
Namibians, let alone good world
citizens.
