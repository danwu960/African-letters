Not African way

FRIENDS of mine talked about |
doing something “the African |

way’, i¢ paying and taking

pribes for licences, appoint- |
ments etc. Well, they are wrong. |

Bribes are as Amencan as apple
pie, as European as fish and
chips and as Afrikaans as Boere-
wors. Pick up Gustavus Myers’
‘The History of the Great
American Fortunes’ and D
O’Meara’s ‘Volkskapitalisme’
and you will see that corrup-
tion was aD integral part of
Furo- American, Euro- African
and European development.
(And the media keep us in-
formed that the Euros of today

are far from corruption-proof). ‘

Corruption means: The func-
tionaries who have been elected
or appointed treat the power
delegated by the public as if
they owned it. What every citi-
zen has a right to demand
because of constitutional or legal
guarantees, because of ment
or certified qualificacions is
withheld or handed out by divine
grace or rather administrative
arbitrariness. The receiver is
then expected to demonstrate
his or her appreciation by being
loyal or at least grateful to the
generous official, by offering
sexual favours or boctic-boetie
support, or by simply paying

Corruption means: The
people wielding power like that
have to secure and enhance
their power. They pull up the
ladders of promotion so that
others cannot claim up to their
heights or they promote only
those who will not be a threat
to them. They, furthermore,
do everything to accrue more
power to themselves and have
their eyes on even higher hier-
archical grandeur.

Corruption, the private ac-
cumulation of power which is
of social ongin and should be
made to work in the public
interest only, tends to threaten
democratic development:

Corruption excludes the
others who happen to be out-
side the pale of power and thus
generates a division between a
new political class and the
majority of the powerless.

Corruption seriously endan-
gers the statal and parastatal

machines’ power to generate
and redistribute national wealth
and tums the attempt to re-
dress colonial inequality by af-
firmative action into de facto
job reservation. Officials who
concentrate on their own rela-
tive superiority are, of neces-
sity, wasteful with resources,
disinterested in their work and
pay nothing but lip service to
the community and the nation.
Corruption undermines the
moral fibre of a nation: People
who are in the limelight as
VIPs and potential role mod-
els do not tum to corruption
clandestinely. They enjoy pa-
rading its results in the form of
conspicuous consumption and
ostentatious grandeur. Com-
moners tend to follow suit by
indulging in petty corruption,
by becoming overtly cynical
or by accepting their contin-
ued exclusion from power as
something having been ordained
by fate.
Namibians have suffered and
died fighting against colonial
cortuption. They certainly have
not taken such sacrifices upon
them to usher in an era of
postcolonial or even neocolo-
nial corruptian. To honour them
we have to continue their fight.
Let ns be honest and check
whether corruption has already
taken roots in our society.
Let usnsist on our rights as

voters, taxpayers and colec-
tive owners of an exemplary |
democratic constitution and
gently but persistently urge our !
Ministers and administrators
to act as servants of the nation.
Let us not forget that foreign
donors have sometimes - proba- |
bly unknowingly - boosted the
public image of corrupt Afn-
can rulers. The flow of foreign
money, goods and know-how
allows many self-serving elites
to impnint on the public mind
that they have a ‘rain-making’
or ‘cargo-cult’ ability to at-
tract foreign wealth and seem-
ingly superior Western exper-
tise. They, of course, have never
been keen on showing the back
side of the coin: debts to be
paid; the resulting redundancy

of traditional indigenous know!-
edge and the potential threat to
established indigenous produc-
tion; an emerging donor-de-
pendency syndrome.

Let us not be fooled into
believing that the splendour of
our upwardly mobile leaders
is of immediate benefit for the
social groups they have come
from and that their empower-
ment is an effective counter-
measure against the still pre-

_ dominant. metropolitan and

white economic set-up.
Let us get rid of the myth
that bribes are ‘African’. Let

‘us call them the offshoot of a

European concept of private
acquisition of goods and power.

Drought vs Falcon

IT is very sad for a developing
country like Namibia to spend
R80 million on an aircraft while
at the same time begging do- |
nors for drought relief funds.
How can the Govemment pur-
chase such an expensive plane
when the country suffers from

a foreign debt of over R800
million?

Some of the arguments ad-
vanced by those who support
the purchase of the aircraft are
credible but these do not jus-
tify the cost of the aircraft.
They have obviously not con-
sidered the grave financial and
political implications ansing
from the purchase of the air-
craft.

The Honourable Minister
Hamutenya argued that it is
cheaper to maintain a new air-
craft. This is not true. The
maintenance and fuel of the
Falcon will cost the Govern-
ment R5 million a year.

The Minister also argued that
the plane can be used on gravel
landing strips. This is not true.
It may land on such strips but
it may not take off. These types
of planes are very sensitive to
dust. And once they suck a
great amount of dust they need
a complete replacement of
certain parts which are very
expensive. The Minister also
gave an example of the Ameri-
can President. We are not
Americans. The Americans
have money to spend as well as
to feed their people. The budget
of Namibia cannot even be

- compared to the budget of an

American city council. After
all, the Americans know their
priorities. .
Politically, the purchase of
an aircraft is damaging to the
image of both Swapo and the
Govemment. Everybody knows
that the country faces a serious
drought problem and other
social evils. People also know
that the Ministry of Transport
owns five aircraft which are
rarely used. Air Namibia air-
ctaft 737 is idlé most of the
