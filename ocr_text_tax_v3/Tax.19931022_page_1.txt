the commercial farmers,
would necessitate factual
clarifications and expla-
nations, which your

have enough space for.

Let us focus on the is-

economy and society.
The NAU, as the rep-
resentative body of the
majority of commercial
farmers as well as some
communal farmers, com-
mits itself to’ handling
agriculture and related
affairs effectively at lo-
cal, national and interna-
tional levels to the ben-
efit of the society. This is

Avenue before 12:00

a mission statement of
the union.

Its actions since inde-
pendence and before
speak of a positive com-
mitment towards the
country and its people. It
certainly does not want
lo evade its responsibili-
ties, like paying taxes.

At its annual congress
in August the NAU ac-
cepted the principle that

be adjusted and that ag-
riculture should be
treated equally to other
sectors. The congress
however felt that the
unique situation of the
farmer (commercial as
well as communal)
should be taken into coa-
sideration and that onty
realised profits should be
taxed.

Can you expect farm-
ers, who made no profits
due to the drought situa-
tion, to pay taxes on the
increased livestock val-
ues and still survive?
Also. what about their
dependents, those who
have worked on their
farms for years? If the
concemed farmers hav:
no income, who will car:
for their farm workers?
Remember, agnculture

is one of the biggest cm-
ployees.
The also de

cided that, the NAU
should negotiate with
government about the
equalisation system re-
garding agronomy farm-
ets. The abolition of the
system willhlt agronomy
