means try to do this. We know
there is not enough money for
all the people, but something

Information and B

emphasises that those who were
October and November last year
will not get paid.

I personally did not register
at that time, but it was not my
fault. Iwasina Swapo mission
at that time, and I arrived in
Namibia from Zambia in De-
cember 1990 while the regis-
tration count had stopped in
November.

When we arrived in Namibia,
we were taken to the Groot fon-
tein army base and we stayed
there for a few days and were
later taken to Windhoek for an
induction. But the programme
failed and we were told to go

| back to our families and wait

tobe called. Up to now none of
us has been called. We want to
ask the Minister whether we
are to be blamed for late regis-
tration in these circumstances?
We stayed behind (in Zambia)
because we were ordered to
and not because we chose to.
Please, Minister Hidipo, try
to understand our problems.

set up by the Government for

accommodate all ofus. Thenif |

we are trained, we are still not
