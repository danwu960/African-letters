. Litele to fear

THE RECENT Lusaka conference
seems to have been a big success. Cer.
tainly, that was the sentiment of the
SWAPO statement, as well asthe view
ofmost participants, who attended the
conference. But was it, really? We do
not profess to know. We were not there,
and, apart from what little informa-
tion appeared about it in ‘The Nami-
bian’ of the 21 October, we have very iit-
tle information about what was
discussed. Perhaps somebody will soon
write some more about it!

However, the Lusaka conference pro-
vides a good starting point to remind
ourselves again of the socialist objec.
tives of a future Swapo government.
And let us make it clear at the outset,
that our allegiance lies within that
broad movement, as the only move.

ing national aspirations at the mo-
ment. But that support could never be
unconditional. There is too much at
stake for that to happen.

Article 111(7) & (8)of the Constitu.
tion, states that a Swapo government
would “exercise effective control over
the major means of production and
distribution, and work towards anon-
exploitative and non-oppressive
classless society’’ No doubt it should
sound sensible for most businessmen
in Namibia to want to trade off some
of the huge profits they are making at
the moment in return for political
stability and international accep
tance. But how much would they real-
ly be willing to give up within the
broad concept of Article 111? A pro-
grensive tax rate of up to 60% or more?

~But rather let-us be clear about the
kinds of benefits the suffering Nami-
bian masses should, and ought, to ex-
pect asogialist government, after
this long and‘arduous struggle.

There is indeed, no reason why the

should be something of a medium. if
not immediate-term objective, of the
future people’s government. Indeed
with a population of about 1,5 million
people, and with the country’s
argricultural, mining and fishing
potential, together with the potential
in under-developed processing in-
dustries, the prospect of Namibia
feeding itself is, in the sense describ-
ed, not a mere pie-in-the-sky notion.
Such prospects must be a lure to the
skilled labour forced in particular, to
remain even after independence.
However, those expectations might
have to be adjusted and related to the
extent to which they are willing to

resources.

unequal distribution of wealth and
power, and are therefore essentially
unacceptable in contravening Article
111. However we may need to be
