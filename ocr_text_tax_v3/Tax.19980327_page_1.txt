MAN appeared on earth approximately 3 million
years ago. The society in which the early man
lived, i.c. the primitive society or stone-age-soci-
ety was characterised by equal distribution of land
to all members of that society; land was never
regarded as the private property of a particular
person but was collectively managed by our ances-
tors. As a result of natural evolution the physical
appearance of the carly man changed and simi-
larly, the classless ‘stone-age’ society was re-
placed by the “slave-ownership society.”

The “slave-ownership socicty” consisted of two
class i.e the slave-owners and the slaves. Some
members of this society contemplated ways of
enriching themselves, particularly means to im-
prove their harvest production. They concluded
that cheap labour and high output would achieve
that end, i.c. slavery became a popularised and
profitable economic ideology and, for the first
time in human history, a man lost his land to
another man. The slave-ownership society was
later replaced by “feudalism” as a result of a revolt
of slaves against the slave-owners.

The “feudalism-system” or socicty was charac-

terised by more advanced economic development.
A great thinker emerged from that socicty who
produced metal and stec! tools which were used to
cultivate land and chop down trees for making
houses etc. He started to barter his products and
consequently assembled a vast fortunc.
Because of his wealth he assumed the role of a
Hippocratic philosopher i.c. by propagating to the
people that he was chosen by God (which explains
his wealth) and that he must be recognised by all
people of the Feudal-socicty as their king. This
was a tuming point in the history of mankind and
is the reason why we have kings and queens today.
History teaches us that nobody was bom a king
or selected by God to act as such. Aside from the
fact that the king enjoyed absolute power he also
had no respect for other people's territory or land
and, once again, man lost his ancestral land to
another person. The common people were re-
quired by law to pay tax by submitting a portion of
their harvest or products from the land which they
| cultivated. This land was regarded as the private
ml pagietty:of the king. Consequently, with the ap-
pearance of classes the government was born.

In view of this the human society was divided
into two classes e.g. the aristocracy and the class of
the landless people. The class-struggle continued
with: the landless demanding the return of their
land: A good example of classes is the British

parliament which consist of two houses Le. the
‘House of Lords’ and the ‘House of the Com. |‘
mons’. The Feudal-Regime was eventually over,
thrown by the class of the landless who revolteq
against the king. The feudal-system was replaced
by a more advanced capitalist system/society,

The capitalist society only replaced Feudal ex.
ploitation of the landless with its new method of
exploiting this class in its industries. The capitalist
society reached its success during the industrial
revolution, a period in which the capitalists be-
came the owners of all means of production, re-
sulting in a constantly growing demand for raw
materials. With this eracame more advanced means
of transport, powerful guns and technology. Gov-
ernors and soldiers were then deployed around the
world to conquer various territories and its people,
in order to exploit the raw materials and manpower
for their industries. The capitalists succeeded in
conquering territories around the world and man
lost his land for the third time in history. Namibia
was not an exception in this regard.

I therefore sincerely to appeal to the land owners
in this country to consider their fellow landless
Namibians who are living in the river beds and in
overcrowded unhygienic conditions; to Bive them
a piece of land as this will create a better under-
standing amongst the people of our society, irre-
spective of the colour of their skins.

If | may quote Martin Luther King, “J Aave a
dream that one day the sons of former slaves and
sons of former slaves owners will be able to sit
down together at the table of brotherhood.”

I would like to extend an appeal to the land
owners and the absentee landlords of Namibia to
voluntarily hand over part of their land to the
landless who are living in the comidors of our
country’s roadside and between the farms of the
landowners

I believe that the day will come when my appeal
will be put into practice. Our society remains
divided because of the uneven distribution of wealth
in this country between the haves and have nots.
Only when we can redistribute the land cqually
wll Namubians start co recognise each others as
equal partners.

This in itself will solve the unnecessary present
and future land confrontation, and bury the in-
equality that is causing people to dislike cach
other.
