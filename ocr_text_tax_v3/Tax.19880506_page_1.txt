Questions to Mo

WHILE listening. to the -interim
government mouthpieca(the SWABC)
in Katima Mulilo, I was shocked to
hear what Minister Mo, the former
Chairman of the Cabinet, terms ‘im-
portant events’ which took place dur-
ing hie chairmanship. He mentioned
the following: — |
'().Dr Franz-Josef Strauss’ visit to
Namibia as being important both na-
| tionally and internationally;

[1 the Cabinet's visit to Jonas
Savimbi;

[1] the Supreme Court's decision on AG

8;
("} the Oshakati bomb blast which
claimed many lives;

Would anyone who is really serious
about the Namibian issue term these
events asimportant? Just what did Dr
Strauss do to classify his visit ag ‘im-
portant?’ His visit was as fruitless as
the recent recent of the men in suits
(one with a matching ostrich-skin |
briefcase and shoes). All these visits,
instead of taking us a step forward to
independence, have merely tried to
I blindfold us. |

The Cabinet's visit to Jonas Savim-
bi was also futile. Just to fly in andout
ofa sovereign state without a passport
and visa, and at the taxpayer's ex-
pense, is as useless as trying to walk
against a wall.

And the Supreme Court's ruling on
AG 8 was just as useless because there
was Super Louis to resist it.

And what isso important about the
Oshakati bomb blast to Minister Mo?
Jsathisan‘importantevent’ which took |
place during your chairmanship? |
| weep to hear a leader speaking that

The last thing Mo mentioned was
himselfand Mr Kozonguizi pushing a
car on the way back from the airport
when they sccompanied the men in
suiteon thelr way back toSouth Africa.
Just to push a skordkoro makes them
feelgreat!

Comeon, Mr Katjiuongua, we know
you are smart, Just put your brains
where your people are and ridyourself
and others of this puppet regime,

Just what makes you proud about all
that, beats me! | 7
