“Dear Mr Ngolombe, if ever there is
4 town in Namibia with 100 per cent
Colonial past it is Swakopmund and you
Probably did not realise that January 27
was the Kaiser's birthday! Had
the British not occupied Walvis Bay

and so denied Germany its natural har-
bour, Swakopmund would still be bar-
ren desert and you would not be living
in Mondesa.

After World War I, Swakopmund
lost the activity and income of a
harbour. Over the years the earning base
had to be changed. The temperature
and climate helped to make it an educa-
uonal centre and tourist attraction.

For the latter the preservation and
maintenance of buildings from the
colonial past create an atmosphere
which is unique on the African conti-

nent. These buildings are not only pho-
tographed or painted by European,

Asian or American visitors but also
Africans! A notable part of this hent-
age are the street names, which are the
focal point of many a tounist’s camera.
The tourist trade is the main pillar of
the cconomy of Swakopmund and hun-
dreds if not thousands of our citizens
are dependent on it, as well as numerous
handicraft sellers from Afnican coun-
tries with their stands near state house.
As a trade unionist you should be
more concemed about: - the massive
unemployment in the town, and the
whole of Namibia; - the AIDS cnisis:-
the shortage of classrooms and suitab! y

ing dismal pass rate after ten years of
independence; - the living conditions of
inhabitants in squatter camps like the
one next to Mondesa,; - the increasing
cnme rate, also in Swakopmund; rather
than wasting money you have not camed
on changing street names and thereby
sabotaging the uniqueness of a town,
that you have not founded, but take the
liberty of living in.

If you want to eradicate the colonial
and apartheid past, you will put Na-
mibia with its present infrastructure
from prime position in Africa right to
the end of the queue. As a consequence

among your comrades. As a taxpayer,

investor and resident of olg

Swakopmund, I am under the impres-

sion that we who live here and the

business community whocreate wealth
and well-being for all inhabitants, have
No say in the issuc of street names and
yet everything is made to look very
democratic. In the end we will be asked
to foot the bill for an unnecessary and
costly act. How is one to interpret the
daily plea by NBC on reconciliation
other than by cynicism? Hoping that
sanity will prevail.
