Tax Return Confusion

BETWEEN the end of April and the
be ginning of May 1998. the NBC broad.
Casta news item, staung that duc to the
fact that the Receiver of Revenue was
extremely late in pouing the various
Income Tax Retums to enterprises and
individuals, the Minister of Finance has
announced that all tax retums only have
to be sentin by July Jt st instead of June
0, 1998. The latter date 1s the one that
would have been duc of the forms would
have been posted umeously.

The Receiver of Revenue, Account-
ants and Tax consultants are all aware
of this newscast, yet when | consulted
the Receiver about this two weeks ago,
they said that to date no official notifi-
cation was received from the Minister
and that they sull regard June 30 as the
deadline for the tax submissions, even
though they were aware of the broad-
Cast.

Ay the NBC is the only official link
for a great number of our population in
respect of tax matters it should be a
relrable wource of informauon. It is
bound to happen that many taxpayers
willincur penalues and interest as they

had fasth in the accuracy of the newscast.

To date. approximately $5 per cent of
all taxpayers have received they form.
On top of that the Receiver beleves that
a normal Salary-camer receives no in-
terest on savings of docs not have other
income. The forms for ordinary tax pay-
ers do not accommodate such details.

On enquiry. | was told that these ex-
traordinary luapayers would have to ap-
ply for different tax status. As dus wall
in all likelihood also take time | wonder
how many taxpayers can submit theu
Tetums on ume. Partnerships or taxpay-
73 with more than onc business can alto
fot make use of the prescnbed form as
no consideration waa given to this possi-
bility. The Receiver has admitted these
shoricomings to me. The new forms must
have cost a fortune and the correcuons
and shortcomings will do 30 again.

lwould appreciate it if the above points
could be taken up with both the Receiver
and the Minister of Finance, as it affects
amayjor portion of our populanon. Enough
is enough!
