Quo Vadis Our Democracy?

PRESIDENT Nuyoma’s report to
the Swapo Central Committee
must have sent shock waves
through democrats both at home
and ubroad. It definitely proved a
point. Democracy in our country
is only as strong as the opposition
is weak.
We have not forgotten the press
conferences called by the then
Swapo Secretary General, Moses
Garoeb, whenever a politician lett
his/her party to join Swapo. They
were heralded as democrats, he-
roes, people unifying the nation
Today when a Swapo member
uses the same democratic and
constitutional right to join or form
another party, he/she 1s a ‘rebel’
who is dividing the nation. Does
this mean that in the understand-
ing of Swapo Central Committee,
the only way to unite the nation
is to be a Swapo member? What
does that mean? We must all be-
long to Swupo, a one party state.
If so, ‘quo vadss’ democracy?
Less than 10 years ago. “Boss”.
the apartheid regime's security
network used to bug the tel-
ephones of those involved in the
liberation struggle, following
their movements and arresting
some of them. At the time, one

was filled with a sense of pride if

would be a thing of the past

the same oppressive system.

this was happening to you be-

regime for an independent demo-
cratic Namibia where these evils

less than (en years, we are facing

In a totally arrogant violation of
the constitution, whilst being paid
by all Namibian taxpayers.
Tshechama shamelessly admits to
bugging telephones. What he did
not admit to, is how his agents
followed Namibitans who were
holding a peaceful meeting out-
side Outjo, and once they left, the
agents had the temerity to ques-
tion workers at the camp. Why 1s
this happening now? What threat

are democrats to Namibia? The
only threat 1s obviously a threat
to Swupo and in the understand-
ing of the Swapo CC the party 1s
the nation and the nation is the
party. One wonders whether they
understand the concept of govern-
mentas having three arms Execu-
tive, Leyvislative and Judictary,
and NOT the Swapo CC

One wonders whether the Prest-
dent's speech was nothing more
than Tsheehama’s intelligence re-
port on CoD and if so, does
Tshechama report to the Swapo
CC or the Namibian Government?

The ultimate shock for a
Namibian democrat must come
from the reaction of some CC

members regarding the election of
a new CCN General Secretary
Because they feel incapable of
leadership in Swapo and because
they showed so httle moral obh-
gation to the Namibian Consutu-
ton regarding the third term, they
expected the CCN to do the same
Hence their inability to under-
stand and recognise actions from
CCN leaders, In the first place Dr
Nakamhela was not elected, nor
did he stand for a third term be-
cause the CCN constitution ex-
pheitly precludes any General
Secretary from Being elected for
a third term.

Dr Nakamhela, areal democrat,
made no attempt to mess with the

Again, we are led to understand
that the Swapo Central Commit-
tee was threatening action against
civil servants and managers Ut
parastatals who are sympathetic to
CoD. Are these the same people
who, when they felt unchallenged,
made provision tor civil servants
to take eave of absence to contest
elections? Or was this only meant
for Swapo-supporing cial sery-

Finally, Namibians, open your
ears and eyes and read the signs
Our hberation struggle was not to

Tsheehama, to change the consti-

Namibians freedom of association
or to have a one party state. The
time has come to stand up and
defend our hardwon democracy.
