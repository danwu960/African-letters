ve " Nowsevery day,morn-
me ing andevening, we have
the same handful of peo-
_ plecalling the talk shows,
- again - and again - and
| again, repeating the same
boring accusations,
which are wild, to say
the least.

Come on fellow
Namibians. Let's be in-
| telligent about this.
Mr Mubita had his
Chance and he didn't grab
it with both hands.
It seems to be becom-

ing a trend among some

people these days to try
and deflect from the truth
and the reality, and to try
and distort matters, by
raising emotive issues
» which have no bearing"

on the facts. 4

Quite honestly, I feel +
these sort of tactics
should be confined to the
trash bin.

We need to push for-
ward, learn from our mis-
takes and in the process
become better people, —
able to make abettercon-
tribution toour work and

| to gur cbuntry. "
