PERMIT me space in your newspaper to address
the Ombudsman, the supposed upholder of our
Constitution in respect of Natural Resources.

Sir,

After returning from a ten day holiday at the
coast, | am of the opinion that you are not doing
your job, or rather, you are neglecting your
duties.

Let me be specific:

1. Damaging the Environment

When travelling between Okahandja and
Karibib, one cannot help noticing one heap after
the other of concrete boulders. ONE HEAP AF-
TER THE OTHER of unsightly rubble. Nobody
debates the necessity of building a fibreoptic line
to the coast for better communication.

Surely this Is no excuse for destroying a beau-
tiful countryside with unsightly rubble.

I have taken time to investigate - near the
railway lines there are enough borrow pits of past
construction that serve no purpose.

With a loader and a truck, these heaps could be
removed and the holes filled - a dual purpose
served.

2 Empty bottles and bags

Travelling along the highways, one sees end-
less heaps of glass bottles, 99 per cent of them
non-returnable (in the desert we found only 4
returnable bottles, which we collected). Why is It
NOT possible to promulgate a law, making all
non-returnable fluid containers illegal, or at least
place a heavy tax on all these glass and plastic
containers.

It seems as if all parties concerned shun their
responsibility - firstly, the firm that is marketing
the product, secondly, the legislator who is well
aware of the negligent attitude of the population
at large, thirdly, the Ombudsman who is ulti-
mately responsible for the environment and
fourthly, each and every member of the popula-
tion.

Take time to look at the legislatior. of our so
often shunned neighbours and try to estabish
why their countryside is reasonably clean

Sir,

PLEASE DO SOMETHING
CONCERNED WINDHOEK
