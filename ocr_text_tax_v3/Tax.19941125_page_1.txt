| Empty Promises On

ALLOW me to air my dissatisfaction
about the unfavourable odour in
Tamariskia and Mondesa townships.

The inhabitants of these towns face
a huge problem which 1s the never-
ending small of what seems to be
human excreta. The smell is worst in
the houses situated in the place known
as ‘Old Tamariskia’.] want to ask the
Town Council of Swakopmund about
the removal of the controversial sew-
age dam from the middle of the resi-
dential area.

As a matter of fact the former white
municipal council] was blamed for
building the sewage dam among resi-
dences of the blacks. But after the
white council was voted out of power
and the current councillors vowed to
remove it if they were elected, noth-
ing happened.

It seems these were just empty
promises. The explanation that there
is not enough money to remove the
sewage dam is not fair as we pay our

fen

rates and taxes as other home owners
and arc entitled to breathe fresh air as
others do.Imagine waking in the night
and finding your house smells like
someone has just defecated on the
floor and after investigation you find
the whole house smells like that. It
might affect us in other ways too as we
are obliged to constantly use air fresh-
eners to make things bearable.At
present Swakopmund is undergoing
structural changes and the town will
receive tourists and would-be home-
owners and I can assure the Council no
one would like to stay in such condi-
tions.

Please convey my request to the
town council to look for a suitable site
to relocate the sewage dam - before
someone becomes sick and considers
claiming huge sums of money from
our already ‘poor’ town council.
