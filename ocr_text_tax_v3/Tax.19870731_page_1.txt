a
On ‘Bothacracy’
IN RESPONSE to Mr Veripi Mungun-
da’s idle talke in The Namibian of Ju-
ly 10 on the topic ‘Coward Lister’, I
would like to point out the following:
1, Lister - nationality and
patriotism: | feel it is Ms Lister's full
right to express herself against the in-
justices and brutalities conducted
against the Namibian national, ir-
respective of where she was born. She
isa morecredible Namibianthan you,
who are selling out your nation, your
country and its natural resources. She
pays taxesasall Namibiansdo andin
addition, contributes actively to bring-
ing about of peace and stability to
Namibia, while you keep yourself
tribalistic and passive. Beloved Lister,
keep on, every good work deserves a

reward.
3,.0P0-SWAPO- an Ovambo par-
ty: OPO has not existed for along time.
It has been the South West Africa Peo-
ple’s Organisation, Swapoof Namibia,
for along time. How dare youcallitan
Ovambo party, although it isa Nami-
bian national political movement?
$.CCN - priests, puppets Shame on
you, Mungunda. These people repre-
sent the Namibian nation (the Coun.
cilof Churches in Namibia). They are
renowned for fighting for peace, justice
and liberty, and committing
themselves to the spiritual care of all
Christians.

4.9wapo generals- where are they?
Swapo has been willing to sign an ar-
mistice with the Pretoria regimo and
latter has failed to agree to it. And now,
Mr Mungunda? Swapo did not glorify
war, but was forced to take up arms
against those you praise.

5. NCU - a truly Christian body
Could atruly Christian body request
the dismantling of its own nation’s
refugee camps? Campe where Chris:
tian Namibians reside? Who do they
think will house Namibians fleeing
from the racial laws in thiscountry? Do
they think it iseasy tostay outside the
country without proper supervision
and do they think it is easy to provide
such supervision there? -

finally wish tocondemn Voripi and

his t structure for:

O vaining that apartheid laws are
dead in Namibia;

1) requesting pre-independence
development aid and recognition ofthe
interim jy-ernment internationally,
oo rupiprting the unelected,
unreprezzitative socalled interim

rnment, |

Pr affiliating to onethnic-based party
such as Nudo;

[1] legitimising SA's presence in
Namibia by being part of reactionary
forces such as Etango, Swapo!l, Bwat!.

Lalso condemn the interim govern:

ment for their ‘secret services’ and pro-
paganda of indoctrination and

discrediting Bwapo with our tax
monies. They urge Pretoria's forces to

‘exterminate Swapu' and ‘hit them
harder’ which automatically causes

le to leave the country.
have never been deceived by

Voruter" me nor will we be daceiv:
ed by atneracy. Remember that,
Veripi.
