Test Politicians For HIV As Well

I READ with shock the ion that couples who
plan to get married should be required to undergo HIV-
AIDS tests. I do not know why some political leaders
find it necessary to infringe on the private lives of some
people.

This suggestion comes soon after Government de-
cided to subject potential overseas students sponsored
by Government toan HIV test. I agree that it isexpensive
to transport a corpse from overseas or a physically
incapacitated Motswana when the test could have pre-
vented that.

I support this move because we are going through a
period of economic hardships and need to save money.
But I am disturbed by the latest idea. If we are to do it,
we should start with politicians by asking them to
undergo an HIV test before they campaign for political
office because some of them are cared for by the state
and taxpayers’ money is spent to pay for their medical
expenses.

Therefore, if such leaders are not tested pnor to
altaining office, then the country can incur expenses that
can be avoided by subjecting them to a test.

It is also important to test those aspiring to take
political office as parliamentarians and councillors be-
Cause it is expensive to run a by-election asa result of the
death of a politician while in office. Italso denies people
effective political representation due to ill health of such
a representative if s/he fails to perform satisfactorily.
Upon his/her death, constituents may stay without a
political representative until after a by-election.

In Praise Of Namibian Land Stance

THANK you for your great and explicit article on
“MPs press for urgency, cool heads on land issue”
(May 23). —

As a Namibian now living in Germany it gives me
much pleasure to see democracy in Namibia not as
something people just talk about like in other Afmcan
countnes, but as something the people are actually
practising. In fact Namibia could be seen to be even
