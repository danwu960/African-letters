Govt Must Act On ‘Rogue’
Officials At Home Affairs

TWO anticles have appeared in The Namibian dur-
ing the last quarter (latest in April 11 edition) about
problems at the Home Affairs Ministry.

As a person employed by an expatnate organiss-
tion for the last four years and whose responsibil:
ies include securing appropnate permits for foreign
experts coming to Namibia, mainly for capacity
building and consulting purposes, I feel odliged to
add my voice to attempts at informing the public
about the state of decadence at the so-called “Aliens
Conuol section of the said Ministry.

The pointis, we do not have enough Namibian ex-
Perse in the field in which ! work, and therefore we
frequently import expertise. As a result | have been
frequenting the comdors of this Ministry for the last
three years and | have hterally witnessed the retro-
gression taking place. Therefore, | can comfortably
say the letters in The Nammbian (one complaining
about a would be investor told to lake his money back
to his country, and the other complaining about Mr
Mushclenga’s response on a NBC programme which

was found to be far different from what unfolds in

that Ministry on daily basis) as merely cxposing the
Gp of the proverbial ice berg

In a point-by- point fashion, | have Pinpomnted sone
of the glaring issues which reflect the Present state
of affairs at the instutution in question

1) The is no standardised system of handling en-
quires ata place which handles hundreds of apph-
cauions a day, Doing telephonic inquiries 18 virtually
Impossible. Exenit you call the person whose name
appears on the sitp issued with an application sub
mission, one gets referred to up to five officials,
spends at least 20 minutes on the phone and still does
not achieve anything.

Physical visits - which ulGmately pay off - are also
no mean feat by any means. | have scen and even

experienced doors slammed in people's faces, poo:
ple being yelled at. ora person who 15 supposed to
work on your application simply lifting bis her shoul-
der and then you are stuck until a person teels bike
working on your application - and this can take weeks.

These atutudes are indiscriminate and cenainly do
not conform with GRN and the President's attempts
to sell Namibta as an investor and tounst haven.
Therefore, please intervene.

2) No state-of-the-art system of information man-
agement. An anuquated filing system as used. Such
systems work in small establishments but an institu-
tion which handles citizenship documents, permits,
passports and the other essential documents of 1,6
Million Namibtans and close to 100 000 (thumb suck)
expatriates should at least have a centralised compu-
terised system.

The present system leads to loss or misplacement
of files (real of pretended). a cumbersome process
of file retrieval and therefore, complaisance, open
for abuse since there is no way to avoid issuance of
more than the allowed number of the same document
to one person. What this all leads to 1s gross inefh-
ciency and undue delays.

Although Mr Mushelenga might say computerised
systems are expensive and the State can not aiford
them, how about moncy lost through perpetuating
an inefficient system?

3) Seniors do not seem to review and vet applica-
tion before they are tabled at the immigration selec-
tion board (ISB). This results in the tabling of in-
complete applications, and one's application gets re-
ferred back a number of times for one or the other

outstanding documenvinformation. This is at times

Costs us high calibre consultants. These People don
wast for three months for a short-term work permit.
they are always on the move.
4) Erroneous endorsements are also very common
:
Perticularty a the points of entry. Once an acquaint.
ance of mince, a Narmibian CHucen, was returning from

the RSA and her passpon gt endorsed with a three.
Tonth holiday permit. When she discovered the fault
and approached the Ministry. she had to uke a lot of
Mak. [am convinced that there are Many peopte out
there who have had similar experences. Please come
out!

5) Passport renewals Intermatonally, not many
countnes allow you entry on a passpon which is valid
for fess than six month. As a result, many expen.
enced and forward thinking travellers renew (or at
least attempt to) their passports - which are not full
but are simply expiring - during the last six months
of validity. This rule ts not applied at Home Affairs.
Colleagues of mine travelling to non-SADC coun.
tncs always get problems in this regard.

6) Although probably by choice, I have also no-
ced an alarming exodus of expenenced staff from
thes institution in the period that | have worked with
them. Most such people fall in the Category of those
who worked for the pre-inde pendence establishment
The result ts a general decline in cflecveness, mex-
pencnced people lelt to themselves to handle at umes
complex issues, and the provision of INC ONSiStent in
fommation. What makes this suspicious of late ts the
fact that when a person leaves and one Wes to con.
tact that person for inquiries, one ects told the .
sonison leave, Next uhing ts for one to find the pay.
ucular officer working quite comfortably clsewhere
- you know Windhoek is not big. I recently asked
such an official whether he/she was doing a holiday
yob and she-he did not take it kindly. Whatever this
means, 1 affects us, the “chents” of the Ministry,
extremely adversely

7) General atutudes of the staff, Everybody who
has dealt with this Ministry even once will agree wath
me about the levels of artogance, aggression. impo-
\ueness and unprofessionalism characterising tne
business of this Ministry, Numerous conmplaints about
paricular offeaden, who rouuncly slam doors in peo-
ple’s faces, have met with silence.

People subjected to this treatment are not only blee
collar Namibians like me. They include tounsts ¢x-
tending their visa, would-be investors, investors al-
ready in the country, virtually everybody without ¢x-
ception. Therefore, one wonders whether the follow -
ing has ever occurred to the rank and file of this Min-
istry:

a) That our Government leaders are sctling Na-
mubia as the smile of Afnea at every opportunity,

b) That GRN spends millions every year to pro
mote Namibia as a4 tourist and investor destination
through our missions abroad and with all of ficial vis-
Its by Ministers and President Nujoma:

¢) That every time we host a state/officral visit for
leaders of other countnes, these leader are accom.
panied by business delegations who make business
contacts during such visits. These people normally
come back in their private capacities (would-be) to
follow up on these contacts and get subjected to this
kind of weatment. They will obviously take their
money elsewhere. This does not bode well for Gov-
emment’s dnve to attract direct foreign investment.

Mr Pome Minister please intervene since the Gov-
emment’s collective image 1s being tamished. We
know that our southem neighbour is far sexser in the
cyes of investors and docs not have to putin as much
effort to attract them.

If this state of affairs in the Ministry of Home af-
faars is allowed to continue, we are shooting ourselves
in the foot.

1 also understand that the Prime Minister's Office
plans to launch an efficiency programme. I think
Home Affairs perfectly deserves to be among, the first
clients of such a

Finally, and little bit unrelated, when last have the
fees of Namibian permits been reviewed. They are
ridiculously low compered with what other countries
charge for particularly work permits, permanent and
temporary residence permits and study permits. |
thank the GRN is losing potential income. What about
charging departure taxes at the airport perticularty
with the imminent commercialisation of the ports?
EXTREMELY WORRIED,

FORMERLY DISADVANTAGED
