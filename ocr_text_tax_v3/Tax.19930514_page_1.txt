car registration is GRN

When I came to
Ongwediwa, | saw an-
other GRN 7602, a white
Isuzu pickup, carrying
another load of animals. I
started to wonder whether
the people, especially
civil servants, now have
a free hand in plundering
goverment properties as
they wish. Not long ago I
saw a schools inspector
carrying a wheat basket
in his car and on many
occasions I come across
government trucks on the

government what is al-

allowed as passengers,

spoilers of our govern-
ment?
