A Crazy Move By

Placed in The Namibian on
Th . May 2003 21 entitled
me pe Prepared to Take
Over Immigration Funcuons’.

It seems that Mr Jerry Ekandjo,
the Minister of Home Affairs,
has run out of constructive ideas.
He plans to disband the Immigra-
tion Division, which was eStab-
lished since 1990 after Independ-
ence. Currently he is intending to
abolish the Department of Immi-
eration. According to reliable
sources of information, about 400
Police officers are to be trained to
replace and take over immugra-
lion duties.

Imagine the Department of
Immigration now in existence for
13 years with dedicated and long-
serving officials, but their expe-
NENCE 1s now being wasted.

Now he is going to abolish the
whole Department of Immigra-
Uon and start afresh and from the
Scratch to train new Police offic-
€rs to take over the key functions

of the IMMi gration Officials.

It is very easy to destroy but
vety difficult toreconstruct again.
It can take the Ministry about 13
Years lo reach the Same level] at
Which it is at because the
new Police officials will not have
enough experience in the field of
Immigration.

What resources in terms of tax-
Payers’ money are to be spent on
training 400 new Police officials
lochange
MMigration Act? That money
could have been used on some-
thing else. Eitherto Purchase new
Vehicles for the Poorly equipped
Police force of to install compu-
lerised systems at the main bor-
der posts like at Anamsviei and
Noordoewer where the immigra-
ion officials are sull Operating
On manual systems or to intro-
duce new development plan
within the department.

Inspector General Hangula,
Supreme commander of the
Namibian Police, has also issued
aconfidenual circular to all com-
manding officers of the Police to

Ekandjo

NCnULY Suitable candidates to fil
the immigration unit.

In the circular the general re-
Minds the regional and command-
Ing Officers that the Cabinet has
resolved that the immigration

artment currently resorting
under the Ministry of Home Af.
fairs be abolished and the func-
tions be Sourced out to the
Namubian Police. Apparently this
circular was issued as top secret
and must not be Teleased to cur-
rent immigration officials because
the Minister, Jerry Ekandjo, and
the Cabinet wants to do away
with them.

The communique ended by stat-
ing to all commanding officers
that the nominations should reach
his office by July 22 2003 and
Should be addressed for the atten-
tion of Inspector Kahihakumwa.
