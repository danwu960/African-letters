Burning National Issues

THANKS for allowing me space in
your newspaper. I have a few
burning national issues to share with
my fellow countrymen and women.
I absolutely fail to understand how
the political leadership understands
their responsibilities and
accountabilities in general.

Itis aserious cause for concem to
see or witness how irresponsible
your representatives could be at the
expense of the landless poor.

I think the respective legislatures
are very clear on who should take
what stringent steps and when. The
song about the absenteeism of MPs
is getting old and requires urgent
action if democracy 1s to prosper in
this country. Something reminds
me that it was excellent that MPs
had to declare their assets and
financial interests although it would
not eliminate nepotism, corruption
and fraud etc. However, it is
deplorable that all these warnings,
sound practices and measures are
falling on deaf ears.

His Excellency, the President, has
onnumerous occasions warned MPs
totake up their parliamentary duties
seriously and to at least respect the
“oath of office” that they have taken.
! wonder in whose interest the
parliamentarians are rushing or
delaying legislation at times - just
to be patched up with the
terminology of amendments to suit
the interest of certain individuals. It
appears to be an attitude of ‘I have
to take itand I need not to respect it

and/or I can break or amend it atany
given time.’ How fastcan MPs who
are frequently neglecting their
duties, enact laws? They are rather
paying more attention to their
personal business and respecuve
interests in the constituency from
where they hail.

When will the Government
remove the ‘big thom’ (fraud at
local authonties) in its eyes to see
that stringent disciplinary action is
needed against the CEOs convicted
of corruption and fraud. I am of the
opinion that repaying the stolen
funds and firing should be weighed
up as a remedial step in search of a
permanent solution to the saga. It
seems that democracy is busy dying
a natural death as elections don't
take place as scheduled. The
leadership simply don’t want to
relinquish positions any longer or
make way for others.

I am in agreement with those
who feel that the National Council
should rather be surengthened and
aotabolished. My argument is based
on the time-consuming and much
talked-about decentralisation
policy. I strongly feel the electorate
should have reputable local political
representatives at national council
level who know their problems and
collective interests. Let the
grassroots decide their own fate.

Land tax is another cause of
concern for which the poor
innocents will be punished in the
end. Some emerging commercial

farmers are struggling torepay their
loans to Agribank. Imagine how
they will cope with that financial
burden coupled with the prevailing
drought

situation if no good rains are
forthcoming. We should remember
thatthe success of good governance
is not being measured by the number
of laws but rather on the successful
implementation of these laws in the
best interest of the public at large.

Finally, we should get serious
about the enactment of laws and
equally serious about their speedy
implementation. Otherwise we can
throw them in a waste bin once
again at the expense of the poor
electorate. The leaders should
ensure that all elections should take
place as stipulated and are not
delayed unnecessarily. We must
bear in mind that lawmakers and
law drafters had been paid for their
cole already and nextin the line are
the implementers. Let's uulise
energy, scarce resources and every
second to put the available golden
Opportunities to good use.

Remember that tuming a blind
eye toreality, truth and facts borders
on selfishness and self-ennchment
schemes, which reminds us that
political offices are temporary

positions.
