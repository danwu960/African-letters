Okalongo anger

WE AS students at the
Okalongo Senior Pri-
mary School would like
to raise our problems to
the Ministry of Educa-
tion as we]l as to the pub-
lic at large.

- There is no order at
our schoo! especially in
grades 8-10;

- teachers are wasting
taxpayers money - they
attend only two lessons a
day then wait for their
salaries;

- some subjects are
taught by inexperienced
teachers which results in
failures for most students
at the end of the day,
especially Grade 10can-
didates;

- the inspector does not
consult students on their

problems when he visits

_ the school;

- the principal is ap-
pointing unqualified
teachers while qualified
ones are being chased
away;

- tribalism is growing
rapidly as most
Ovambadjas as being ap-
ee regardless of

nto
