that we are all liars or ignorant of the
true facts when we say that the SADF
and Koevoet are not here to protect us
Ido not expect anyone to deny the fact
that the socalled protectors are the
ones whorob usofour property, plough
through out homesteads with their
Caspirs, burn houses and shops, and
subject us to other atrocities.

Since Iam atrue Namibian and a
resident of the far north, Kierie du
Rand does not have the nght totell me
about the state of affairs in Ovam-
boland or who ts i_sponsible for things
here. We are the ones who suffer.

It ts high time and every resident
should be on hisor her guard. It iytime
civilians follow the example of Mr
Joseph Nambala to defend themselves
and their families.

Every normal-thinking Ovambo-
speaking person, with the exception of
Kautwima, Dan and Nghixulifa, know
that the presence of the SADF and
Koevoet here will result in the con
tinuation of the present state of affairs.

Namibia appears to have become one
of the most chaotic countries in Africa:
protectors turn into arch enemies, and
sometimesone does not know whichis
which. Hundreds suffer, but Swapo 18
blamed.

The socalled protection of the SADF
and Koevoet has now turned sour.
Their actions have created enmity
among Namibians who cannot trust
them.

My people, unchain yourselves from
bondage. Don't wait for gameone else
to do it; you are your own liberatore

Who's at fault?

WE OFTEN hear of price increases
and the reasons offered therefore are
the increase in transport tariffs, raw
materials, labour costs, etc. Is this a
complete list of reasons?

Inthe 'Sake-Rapport” of 31 January
1988. Messrs Andreé Laubscher and
Flip Meyer write about an additional
factor - shoplifting. They say that
shophfters shopliftersin South Africa
cause a loss of between R700 million
and R1000 million annually. This
figure represents more thanatwelfth
of the total sales tax paid in one year.
Inthesame article it isreferredtoone
of South Africa's big chain stores.
which, in 1986, lost approximately
R20 millon inconsequence of thievery
According to this store, children are
responsible tor about 30 percent ofthe
thefts The aforesaid forces
shopkeepers to make certain ad
justments to heir price structures in
order to survive

We as shopkeepers have tocope with
agreat problem regarding shoplifting
by children, Do we have to punish these
children ourselves, should we call in
their parents or summons the police?
Nowadays I have doubt whether it will
be of any avai} to contact the police.

On Friday May 20 1988, Ihad to ap-
pear incourttotestify in ashoplifting
case. After having waited until 10h00
for the case to begin, | overheard anin-
teresting conversation The
magistrate had bought a new Cressida
2,4GLand had to leave urgently to set-
tle matters concerning the sale
thereof. He therefore adjourned the
court until 11h00.

Eventually, when the court was in
session at 11h00, everybody had to
leave the court because the defendant
was under age. approached one of the
court officials to enquire if I, being a
witness in the cage, also had to leave
the court. After this ofMfial had confer-
red with the state prosecutor, | was ask
ed to leave the court

After about 5 minutes f saw the
defendant leaving the court. The
dofendent’s lawyer then told me that
the courts’ verdict was ‘not guilty and
dismissed on the basis of there being
no defence as a reault of absence of
witnesses”. When 1 objected, the
lawyer told me: “Sorry that's how the

state is”

IT would like to ask: who is responsi-
ble for another factor in price increases
in thiscase - the thiefor the magistrate
who spends his working time on
private business and the prosecutor
who goes about his task superficially?
