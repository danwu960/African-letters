Catalysts Not Working The Way They Should

WE know that Namibia is officially classified as a less
developed country (LDC) and needs money — plenty
of it in order to cater for its development needs. We
also know that mulunationals, such as De Beers, BP,
Shell, etc. have plenty of money, which they are will-
ing to invest.

A recent UN report on human development, which
compares the level of human development among na-
tons, revealed that Namibia has slid down a couple of
places on the world ranking. The Namibian gini coef-
ficient, which indicates the gap between the poor and
the nch, has also skyrocketed to become the widest in
the world. Although these statistics can be interpreted
differently to suit various perspectives, the one fact
that remains undisputed from whichever perspective
one looks at it, is that the average Namibian’s living
standard has not improved at all. The question then is
why not? Why could Namibia not make a meaningful
improvement on the wealth of its nationals? f want to
look at this question from the perspective of multina-
tional presence in the country, because, I strongly belief
they are supposed to be the catalyst of development in
any country. Their presence is supposed to boost job
creation, business confidence, financial development,
productivity and further investments.

‘It is clear from the above-stated statistics that the
presence of multinationals have not boosted Namibia’s
wealth creation (poverty eradication) objective.

One of the reasons for this is that historically multi-
nationals are known for bringing lots of money in, but
sending lots more out — much of it through the back
door’. It is this backdoor exit of money from the least
developed countries like Namibia that destroys their
hopes of ever eradicating poverty. The backdoor chan-
neling of money is done through various means, among

others, embezzlement, diversion of funds, undervalu-
ation of local inputs, false invoicing, non-payment of
taxes, kickbacks and bribery.

For example: We are currently paying extremely
high pnces for petrol. Under the current arrangement
all our petrol is coming via South Afnca through the
big five — Shell, BP, Engen, Caltex and Total. The base
and landing price calculation is formulated on South
African In Bond Landed Cost (IBLC) structure, which
has little, if at all, direct relation to international oil
wading prices.

This inevitably leads to Namibians subsidizing the
excessive South African refining margins. This also
enables the oil companies to effectively keep the profits
that they make on supplying the fuel to Namibia outside
the country. This diversion of funds is one way of back-
door channeling of money, which deprives the country
of much needed revenue and forces the government
to pass the cost on to the consumer by way of higher
prices at the pumps.

Examples of this nature are plenty in almost all the
sectors of the economy. But whilst we are still at the
petroleum sector, one should maybe quickly raise an-
other concern. Is it feasible fora country like Namibia to
procure a national strategic resource like petroleum from
a single source (South Africa)? Although not relevant
to the above argument, one needs to critically analyze
this concem and maybe create a different platform to
address it. For now, let us scruunize the operations
of these so-called multinationals and ensure that they
keep human development in Namibia on top of their
agendas.
