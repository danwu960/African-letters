IS a new State House really
necessary? | am a 19-year-old
boy and 1 am concer-ned about
the tssuc of a new State House.

I am concerned about the
tremendous large amount of
money which will be spenton the
construction of a new State
House. The money which will be
used for this State House is
esumated to be about N$300
million dollars. Why is the
Government only concerned
about their affairs and not

you think you are doing to
our beautiful daughter, our
sister, our Namibia?

it is only a waste of money and
why don’t they just renovate the
old State House and then the
money that is left over can be
used for Something else that the
Community needs?
