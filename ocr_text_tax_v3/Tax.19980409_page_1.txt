The DTA Takes
Issue With ‘Laz’

1 REFER to the column ‘Ekse Kuume’ by
Nghumbilemo ya Ndakoman: in The Namibian of
Friday, April 3, 1998.

As this column ts probably read by many peopl |
cannot allow the wniter to get away with his unin-
formed remarks about the issue such as cutting down
the Civil Service. Why does he feel that the opposi-
tion “are dying a slow, painful and ndiculous death?”

Itis time people like this columnist stop making such

unfounded and groundless remarks about the oppo-
sition when they clearly know nothing about what is
happening in the polincs of Namibia.

The wniter goes on to tot cut the hairy old argu-
ment about the opposition only knowing how to
criticise but never providing any alternatives. All this
serves to prove is that the writer never reads his own
or any other newspaper. The official opposition, the
DTA of Namibia, has provided plenty of alternatives
to, for example, the shocking overspending by the
government, the enormous size of the Cabinet, how
to solve the lands issue, and many other important
issues, but the writer clearly finds it easier just to go

along with the stream than to think for himself and
inform himself of what those altematives are.

This is shown by his infantile argument about why
the Civil Service should not be downsized. Where
does he think the money comes from to pay all those
civil servants? This is not a Socialist welfare state
where no one pays taxes and the state employs
everyone until the state is bankrupt. The taxpayers of
Namibia must provide the money to pay all the civil
servants, and there is not enough money in Namibia

to support the civil service.

Only if the government stops spending the taxpay-
ers’ money on unnecessary luxunes and produces a
Budget which will stimulate the economy and boost
job creation will the people about whom the column-
ist claims to be concemed stop suffering. Their
suffering certainly cannot be alleviated by giving
them jobs in the Civil Service.

With regard to the Budget, the columnist should
inform himself to the fact that no one has to date said
a good word about it. The criticism levelled against
it has not come only from the opposition pares, but
also from every economist in Namibia, including
those who support the majonty party. These are
people who have made their mark in the private

sector, not the civil service, and who understand what
it takes to make a country’s economy viable.

T believe that as a columnist in a widely read
newspaper like The Namibian, Mr ya Ndakomani
has a responsibility to his readers not to wnite so
thoughtlessly and irresponsibly about issues he clearly
does not understand or has not thought about prop-
erly. If he cares to visit the office of the DTA of
Namibia, we will be happy to inform him about the
many alternatives we have suggested, but which are
regularly wiped off the table in Parliament by Swapo's
two-thirds majority, which he no doubt helped to
elect.
