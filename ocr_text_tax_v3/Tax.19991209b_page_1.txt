Loss Of Memory?

IN RESPONSE toa letter from “Con-
cerned taxpayer’ (November 19), al-
though I do not deny your near acct
dent. | must state the facts accurately
since you seem to be suffering from
loss of memory.

Firstly, ] was one of the three pas-
sengers inthe Community Skills De-
velopment Centre (Cosdec) car,

- which was notoverloaded. The driver
has a valid driver's licence and was
absolutely sober at the time of the
incident.

We were terrified by the speed
with which you approached the noto-
rious sharp turn. In fact when you
approached the four-way stop our
car was motionless. It therefore puz-
zles me as to how you could recog-
nise two drivers and conclude they
were drunk.

ac eIt is evident that you, the “tax-
aver’, have ulterior motives because
“our allegations (particularly on the
‘charges of drunken driving) are de-

Bid of tangible evidence.

jing.drunken and reckless

Ws of this country al-

Ow you as acitizento lay acharge on

both counts. It is not only the duty of

the police officers. Your next re-

course would be to lodge a complaint
with my Board (Cosdec) if you think
that your case has locus-standi. This
is my challenge to you because you
allude in your letter that you have
:|-prima-facie evidence.

Pamepot portray me as untouchable

our police. By alleging that the police
are unable to take me to task 1s to
imply that they (police) lack integrity
and are corrupuble. That ts tanta-
mount to libel.

For your information, Cosdec has a
clear action programme which was
developed through consultations with
the community, minus you obviously
You would not know that we had a
Viston Workshop in August this year.
although you do seem to know much
which ts supposed to be privileged
information, which also came in u
distorted form to you.

Fifteen trainees were recently re-

cruited and infrastructure renovation
has been completed, and an ongoing
process of capacity building is taking
place. Furthermore the trades we are
offering and work plans. which are
available for your scrutiny, are tany-
ble testimony of our mission state-
ment to involve the community in
torming Cosdee policies and imple-
mentation strate pics.

It is evident that you, “Concerned
taxpayer, have a personal axe to
grind. | will challenge you to come
out in the open and show your truc
colours. Namibia is a tree country
where you do not need to hide behind
anonymity. | welcome criticism atall
times, but not when itis laden with
hidden venom.
