term. Everyone with ears wiid dares'to care has.
heard the President saying the constitution does
not allow him to stand again, He has said he
would retire at the end of his current term. So that
is not the debate we should be having, instead we
should focus on who will take the mantle further.
For a start, the Prime Minister should have
moved one step up. But given the fact he has
reduced the weight of the office of the Prime
Minister to only opening anything that needs to
be opened (public relations events) in the hope of
being scen in areas where he has never been seen
before, and the fact that his wife's business
interests (one JWG Advertising) does not pay
tax to the Government as required by law, his
leadership is in serious doubt. That leaves Only two |
other leaders - the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the
Minister of Lands who can Petform better. tas ume
they are given the chance to lead from the front.
