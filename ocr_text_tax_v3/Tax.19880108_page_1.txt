Arandis unhappy

1S Arandisa proclaimed area or is ita
city or a town? Since, according to Ries-
ing, Arandis belongs to the Damara
authority as far as buying houses 18
concerned, but when it comes to
dismissal of employees, Arandis is &
mine town. Years back we were
assaulted, molested and arrested by
the South African Railway Police at
Arandis railway station where we had
to pay hundreds of Rands in fines.

A similar type of problem is
manifesting itself in Arandis again.
We are overwhelmed by traffic police
‘nanarea where there are no traffic of-
fices, no registration authonty offices.

The streets in Arandis are too nar-
row (for parking purposes) and only
one-way streets! Arandis falls under
Swakopmund (eg. registration
number) and we think that the
behaviour of these traffic police follows
on a Réssing management brief that
alleged accident figures are high in
Arandis. No serious accidents ever
take placethere The behaviour of the
traffic police who seem to be after tax-
payer's money before the 25th of each

month, seems to be aimed at colour.
Why do similar incidents not take
place in Vineta or Tamariskia?

Woe request Réesing management as
wel! asthe Damara authorities to look
into this situation before any
unpleasantness takes place.
