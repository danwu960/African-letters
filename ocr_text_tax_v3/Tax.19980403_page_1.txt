NBC Stands For ‘National.
Broadcasting Cover-Up ::.’

1 AM at last responding to the letter
NBC Replies that appeared in The
Namibian of February 27 1998.
My accusation that the NBC is
boycotting the Single Quarters scam
still stands. This trial is still ongo-
ing but it was only on NBC TV
News three times. Those on trial are
charged with defrauding the tax-
payers or alternatively of misusing
donor funds. I am not saying that
they are guilty but only the fact that
the money involved is public funds
and we have the right to know what
is happening to our money.
By the way, the NBC is supposed
to be apublic broadcaster funded by
us through our tax money and li-

cence fees.

est what is then of national interest?
The nation wants to know how the
hard-earned money they pay - through

taxes - is spent.
We want to know whether we have

elected the right people to public

office.
We do not want to hear that they

are only doing good while the dirt is
being swept under the carpet.

I believe it is the responsibility and
duty of the national broadcaster to
keep the nation informed of the good
and the bad happening in our Gov-
ernment. It is not senseless talk about
covering up. NBC, YOU ARE COV-
ERING UP!! Prove me wrong!
