Colonel Eimbeck reacts to opinions of Pastor Kameeta —

you HAVE GIVEN Vice Bishop
Kamerta space in your newspaper to
volce his opinion. | request thesame
opportunity since you gall yourself
achampion for freedom of speech.

Mr Kamecta claims that the in-
dependence of Namibia is an in-
alienable right, end that it le demand-
ed without conditions altached. He
laright, but why does he, and his par-
ty, Swapo, refuse to acknowledge any
other political opinion in this de-
mand for independence?

Why doesn't Mr Kameeta use his
high office to ensure justice, pesos
and freedom for every Namibian?
He |s aware of the fact that Swapo
does not tolerate opposition. He
knows that everybody opposing
Swapo will be subject to arbitrary
punlshment or even execution
without a fair trial. Mr Kameeta
thould eupport the call made by The
Namibian on Swapoto ensurea fair
hearing for those who are accused of
belng spies for South Africa.

Me Kameeta should be aware of
the fact that marry political parties in
Nainibia have urged Swapo to be an
equal partner In their opposition to

_ South Africa. He should also know

thet refuses to drop the adjec-

tive ‘sole and authentic represen-

tative of the people of Namibia’ Ms |

Lister should inform Mr Kameeta of

"what her experiences are concerning

this imposed status on Swapo. Mr
Kameeta, who has vowed to preach
love, peace and righteousness,
should bein the front to ensure that
every Namibia be granted the right
and the opportunity to work towards
independence of this country.

Mr Kameeta knows that Swapo
regards violence as the only viable
means of attaining independence for
Narnibia, but does he consider the
fact that the majority people in this
country are peaceloving Christians
and thus prefer a negotiated
settlement?

Mr Karrieeta calls for boycotts and
disinvestment and calls the potential
suffering of the majority of people
‘empty phrases’. Simultaneously this
Vice Bishop demands that ‘all peo-
ple must have the right lo decent
housing, and bring up their families
incomfort and security. Free medical
care and hospitatisation must be pro-
vided for all, with special care for
sentor citizens, mothers and small
chlidren. The aged and disabled must
be fully cared for by the State’.

Has it occurred to Mr Kameeta
that foreign investment is vital to
achieve (hese aims? Mr Kameeta is
fully aware of the fact that Swapo
and the CCN regularly call on inter-
national financial support to
alleviate the plight of the people.
Why then should only his party and
its followers benefit from Mnancial
aid and not the majority of the
people?

Will Mr Kameeta care to tell the
public how much he earns and how
much he pays in taxes? Will Mr
Kameeta be prepared to inform the
people of this country about the
lifestyle of those who profess to fight
for independence and liberation
about their contribution towards the
alleviation of the suffering peoplein
the form of financial contributions?
Can Mr Kameeta inform the publicof
what he proposes should be done to
obtain sufficient funds to attain what
all the people in Namibia desire?

Mr contention is that Swapo is
guilty of the most atrocious
discrimination against people. Mr
Kameeta is actively engaged in
Swapo's political activities, this
makes him guilty of discriminating
against his own people too. Accor-

ding to the Oxford dictionary,
discrimination means to ‘make a
distinction, to give unfair treatment,
especially because of prejudice’.
Swapo and Mr Kameeta cal!
everybody who does not comply with
their conditions and with their opi-
nions, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pets etc. Everybody who dares to
speak against Swapo is threatened
and intimidated. Every person who
does not support Swapo is being
discriminated against. This is
definitely not what the majority of
Namibians will support; this is what
the majority of the Namibians want
eradicated.

Mr Kameeta claims his fame and
right to speak about political matters
on his arrest and detention. For any
law-abiding citizen, especially for
devoted Christians, defiance of the
law is detestable. IfMr Kameetaasa
Vice Bishop and even more as a
Swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
alienable right to s¢lf-determination,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not support an
organisation which sees only
violence as a means of achleving

what they desire, namely, to take ower
power of this country.

Mr Nujoma has declared more
than once that Swapo is not is-
terested in powersharing, but ontyin
power itself, During his recent pro-
peganda tour for Swapo in West Ger-
many, Mr Kameeta has proven thal
he is against any form of opposition
to Swapo and that he disputes the
right of freedom of speech of a Ger-
man citizen in his own country. With
this act added to his political antics
against the people of this country, Mr
Kamecta has disqualified himself of
claiming to be a champion for
freedom, Justice and peace.
