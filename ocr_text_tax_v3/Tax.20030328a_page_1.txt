A Commendable Budget

ALLOW me to congratulate Minister Nangolo
Mbumba for producing a well-balanced and equita-
ble budget for the 2003-2004 financial year. Through
this budget Government mied to put its money
where its mouth Is.

The budget is so unassailable that even critics are
finding it very hard to dish out any criticism. Through
the raising of the tax threshold, the doing away with
the pension backlog, the salary increase for public
servants, to mention but a few positives, the budget
gives an indication that Government is seriously
addressing the problems of poverty and the chronic
unequal dismibution of income that characterises
this country. This is highly commendable.

By producing this good budget, Minister Mbumba
has now thrown the bal] into the court of the imple-
ments (the Permanent Secretaries of the various
ministnes and the CEOs of parastatals) to see if for
a change they will assist Government to achieve its
deficit and debt targets through efficient spending.
Well done Minister Mbumba!
