Vote for Swapo, but ...

I WISH to react to the speech deliv-
ered by the Swapo head and chief
coordinator, Moses Garocb, at a Swapo
Youth League seminar in Katutura
on December 1.

The theme of the seminar was
‘Multi-party democracy in Namibia
and the role of the youth’. MrGaroeb
made a strong speech to the more
than 500 young people who gathered
in the community centre hall.

The speech, among others, con-
centrated on the future prospects of
democracy in the country. He in
particular spoke out about the fair-
ness of the last elections in the coun-
try, which he said was full of deceit
and rigging which resulted in Swapo
losing the two-thirds mayonty.

The Swapo leader pointed out that!
the failure to obtain the two third !
majority was due to the fact that |
many foreigners were brought in fron |
South Africa and Angola to vote for
the DTA and other political parties.
This practice, he said, would not be
repeated in the next national election |
scheduled for 1995.

In this context, Garoeb called on
all Swapo members to work hard
politically in order to out-wit other ,
parties, in particular, the DTA, at the
polls, and gain atwo thirds majority.

Well and good, this is the verdict
that all Swapo members will work
hard from now on to ensure an elec-
tion victory for Swapo in the next
general elections.

But there are several factors which
may still prevent Swapo from ob-
taining the deserved two thirds ma-
jority, if the leadership of the party
don’t start looking seriously into the .
problems facing the nation and in
particular, workers, supporters and
sympathisers of Swapo.

The reality is that on the ground
today many people, members and
supporters who voted the party into —
power, are becoming disillusioned ©

problems the nation.

While no doubt is expressed about
the capabilities of the Swapo iéaders
and fundtlodaries to oliange the Matus

qud, one cannot ignore Cw fact Gat
