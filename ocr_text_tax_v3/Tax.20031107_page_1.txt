Home Affairs Nightmare

HOME Affairs Minister, Jerry Ekandjo, please clean
and renovate your house! It is in a disgraceful
state. The taxpayers of Namibia don't deserve
the disorder, incompetence and reluctance
that meets them when dealing with passports, citi-
zenship, IDs etc.

Have you ever tried to telephonically contact
Home Affairs to find out whether your documents
are ready for collection? Donâ€™t bother - you
will either get no reply or an engaged signal - hour
after hour, day after day! Now you have to go into
town, battle to get parking, stand in line for a couple
more hours, only to be told that there was a problem
with your application and that you have to re-apply
all over again. This is three and a half months after
the original passport application and payment! Dunng
these months nobody at Home Affairs bothers to let
you know that there is a problem. You are just not
worth the trouble! What now? Do I have to cancel
my trip? Do you even care? Why do we pay taxes?
We would like some answers!

Annoyed Citizen, Windhoek
