(Open letter to
Presiden Sam Nujoma )

1AM your loyal supporter
a5 well as an ardent sup.
Porter of your Govern.
ment. Tam also a Swapo
supporter,
Over the years | have
observed the management
of the affairs of the coun-
try by Government. Tam
impressed by the confi-
dence the People of Na-
mibiahave Teposed in you
~ Personally and in Swapo.
The confidence was Te:
newed in 1999 when the
People gave you and
Swapo a huge election
victory - with more than a
two-thirds Majority.

Having given you and
Parly such massive
SUPPOrL, the people expect
the Government to pay
allenuion w the issues that
concem their daily lives -
employment, education
and land redistnbution tw
list yust a few.

Clearly the election
campaign of 1999 has
&reat influence on the
Present attitudes of the
People of Namibia, espe-
Cially Swapo members.

Swapo's emphasis on
issues of development,
unity and defence of the
country created amony the
People certain expecta-
Uons. Swapo campaigned
for job creation: the peo-

Meeting All Our Exp

ple now expect jobs. The

Corruption and self.
agrandizement by the
leaders: the People are
Now critical that the lead.
CFs are not honouring their
campaign promises. Is is
the expectations Of the
People which I think the
Government js failing to
meet and this is what |
wish to address,

Namibta has now com-
pleted 10 years of inde-
pendence. I take cogni-
sance and appreciate the
fact that the Swapo Gov-
emment has done a lot for
the people, in terms of
toads and highways, rural
clectrification and water

distribution, investment in
education and health.
However, some of the
things done by the Gov-
emment are quite foolish
and could have been
avoided. These include
frequent travel by the
Prime Minister. Everyone
knows that Namibia is a
Poor counuy and the only
way to defeat poverty is to
accept the fact that it ex-
ISts, to live within our
means as poor people and
to spend every cent that
we have on our priorities,
the things that will make
us richer, healthier and
more educated and better
trained. We should be
more realistic and frugal.

The Prime Minister's
globe-trotting will con-
tribute towards ruining
Government's finances
and erode Government
and Swapo credibility.
Most Namibians know
that the Prime Minister isa
sports fan, especially of
football. He is the patron
of the NFA and ts always
present wherever our
‘boys’ play to give them
mosal encouragement.
What I do not understand
is why the Prime Minister
has to spend Government
moncy by going to attend
Sports events outside Na-
mubta to satisfy his per-
sonal curiusity and love of
sports. For example, in

1992, the Prime Minister
went to Spain to attend the
Barcelona Olympics, at the
taxpayers’ expense. in
1998, the PMspent 16days
in Burkina Faso attending
the All Afnca Games.
at the taxpayers’ €x-
pense. He was the only
prime Minister to attend
the games and stayed far
more than twowecks. [ast
month, the PM went to
Australia uninvited to at-
tend the Sydney Olympics
As a result of him having
imposed himself. he was
refused enury to the village
where the Namibian team
was staying because noof-
ficia] arrangements were
made for him
Rumour has it that from

Ausualia he went to New

Zealand, Thailand, Indo-

nesia, Sinyaporc, Malay-

sia, Hong Kong and Bru.
