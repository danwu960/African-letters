Second thoughts

EN route from my business to the
car park recently, I was held at knife
point, my life threatened and I was
robbed of my handbag containing al!
my money, jewellery and personal
identification items.

Tam fast losing faith in the govern-
ments’ ability to ensure my basic
night to freedom and protechon asa
Namibian resident/citizen.

“Yes, Windhoek/Namibia is becom- _
ing like any other city/country in the
world, but it has the possibility of
romaining a haven away from the
crises of the rest of the world - espe-
cially with sucha small population to

cater for.

Why am I paying tax and colic.
ing sales tax for the government when
my life has changed course with the
police advice to carry a gun and
warnings that the offenders will be
back! I am presently funding a de-
partment which gives the same ex-
cuse as five months ago, that due to
a lack of staff (policemen) no assur-
ances of proper protection can be
offered.

Meanwhile voyages to and from
my business are becoming oightmares
of whether or not I will be mugged,

still possess a car or fumiture m my
flat, As a shop owner live w with daily
reports of theft from associates and
friends ad a plenty of shoplift-

to report in my own business,
