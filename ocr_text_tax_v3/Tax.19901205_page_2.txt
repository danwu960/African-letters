Another disturbing problem tac-

Income tax, overtime super lux, general
sales tax and umport tax were intro-
duced to boost the war machinery of
the South Afncan colomal adnum-
stration.

This ruthless exploitation of our
people by the colomal regame was at
the time understandable. But now
that Namibia is free and the war is
ended, we ree no reason why his
heavy tax should continue unabated.

We do understand the concem of the
government to generate funds through
revenue, but this should not be done
through open and blatant exploita-
tion.

Wlule we all agree with the fact
that the Government has only been in
office fora short ume of eight months,
the vear 1991 must be a year of
practical restructuring and socio-
ecunomuc improvements.

The immugration issue is also sen-
ous, and the Home Affaire Ministry
must set up a commiltce to look into
applications for citizenship and resi-
dent work permits for foreigners.

Swapo leadership should work hard
to convince its followers that Na-
mibia is for Namibians and not for
foreigners.
