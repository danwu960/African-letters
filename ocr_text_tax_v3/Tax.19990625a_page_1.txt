Free Water For Poor?

IS IT not time to look at the situation
where people are being denied commu-
nal water? How can we be unconcemed
when we witness this? Is it an accept-
able practice?

The unemployed in Namibia are a
common sight. They, like all of us, need
water. Must the unemployed die of thirst
or get water for free from poor homes
where they usually come from - the
owners Of Which must pay? Should we
not direct the employees who look after
our communal assets (Namwater) to

provide: a,
1) water to those: aye, paldita: Ma:
basic norm) sa

at each household point for instance‚Äù
Similarly a certain quantity tree to
schools and hospitals?

The community have a say in how our
assets should be run - parastatals admin-
ister communal property and are not
paid badly for this work. Can you travel
freely on the road or pay poll tax, prac-
tised in some countries? Or walk for free
on a lighted street? Or breathe the air
without paying some parastatal for it?
NamAir?

These are matters of common concem
and thus for common debate.
