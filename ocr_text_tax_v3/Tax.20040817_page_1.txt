Why Do Namibians Suffer?

“I DON'T see a reason
why Namibians should
be suffering like this at
all. With only a popula-
bon of 1.8 million people
I personally think that
Namibia should at least
be Ube most productive,
peaceful and prosper-
ous country in Southem
Africa if not in the whole
of Africa

The current social and
economic problems fac-
ing the country cannot
and will not be solved
by the private sector but
by the political will aad
policies of government
in seriously ensuring that
the life of its people is up-
lifted. The private sector
(especially banks) does
not seriously understand
the real issucs facing the
majority of Namibtans
(blacks) and therefore
will not directly assist
in this regard. They do
in fact assist indirectly.
The private sector has
a tegitimate reason why
they do not assist directly
and that is bocause they
are already paying the
government taxes (their
social contribution) for
thal responsibility and
therefore do mot see a
reason why they should
take care of somebody
etse’s responsibility. Ina
way it makes sense.

Why should gover
ment receive
(taxes) and then give the
responsibility 10 some-
body else? It doesa't
make sense.

The issues facing the
country are mainty social
and are therefore not the
direct responsibility of
the private sector but the
direct responsiblity of
the government.

Government only re-
alise (heir truc responsi-
bilities when it comes to
efections and that is when
they stant running around
selling their social recov-
ery plans to the current

shown towards the s0-
cio-economic uplift-
ment and developmen
of its people and their
businesses.

The sotution, | think,
lies in the political will
of politicians to face up
to reality and imroduce
policies which are in
the best interest of the
socio-economic devel-
opment of the country.
Namibtans should also
stand up for a better
standard of liviag as no
other nations will do 20
oe its behalf. Namibia's
current infrastructure
standards are on per
with some of the most
developed nations in
the world and should
therefore refocus most
of its resources and
energies directly into

the development of its
people. What we need
is an implementable
economic recovery plan
thad directly louches the
lives of Namibians.

I am therefore pro-
posing the following
solution:

That the government
establishes a social and
economic development
fund in which it allocases
N$1 billion per year fora
period of five years (to-
taling N$S billion over
& period of five years)
strictly for the social and
economic uplifunent of
its people.

This imitiative will
surely increase the level
of money supply in the
economy especially to-
wards the previous y dis-
advantaged Nasibians

who so desperately noed
the funds so uplift therm-
selves and their standard
of living.

Namibians are a pe-
Gent people and itis only
a matter of lime before
their true colors start
showing. An angry man
liberated this country but
abungry nation can cas-
ily forget that liberation
and turn against thet man
and his friends, leading
to a catastrophe.

The beauty about this
cowntry of ours is Uhet
anything is possible
provided that the right
policies and visionary
beadership are in place.
