Ministers, take note

IT SEEMS the Ministers of our
newly-independent country have
forgotten who has pul them in gov-
ernment.

As reported in The Narubian (Friday
April 6 1990) they will receive huge
salaries of around R12 500 a month.

Our country has gone through a
long struggle. The people have
struggied together, workers and stu-
dents have really sacrificed; our PLAN
combatants have given up their edu-
cation and lives to serve (for no sal-
ary) the motherland - but if seems our
Ministers have forgotten.

Some ex-combatants have not yet
acquired jobs. Many have lost their
families and have no one to support
them. Our education system has to
continue to support racists and auto-
crats who now pretend to have
so as to retain their jobs, all for the
sake of reconciliation. Is’ ‘reconcili-
ation’’ the reason for these high sala-
nes?

It seems that we are not only
“reconciling’’ with ex-colomal
masters, we have a which
wants to mould itself according to
them. Our leaders preached equality,

1 elitism pnor to independence. —

ompromised to mixed —

wocialism was C
economy. Does compromise mean
‘throw equality an the rubbish heap'"?

Even the colonial masters and its
stooges were never paid such incred-
ible salaries. The foundation for a
new Namibia cannot be laid thus.
Before you raise your salancs, Min-
isters, raise those of the workers.
Remember that you pay fornotaxes,
housing, transport etc. Are our taxed
based on underpaid salaries to pay
for you to get rich?

We cannot grant you the right fo
forgot the struggling masses.

Workers and trade unions should
voice their grievances as we did against
the Pretoria regime and its stooge
Are we to remain silent due to altii-
ations? | .
