Musician Street
Names A Joke

THE proposal by the Windhoek Munici-
pality to name streets after musicians like
Louis Armstrong, John Coltane, Elvis
Presley and John Lennon, etc. is not only
laughable, but ridiculous.

How many Namibians have heard or ap-
preciated the music of these people? This

exercise is a waste of taxpayers’ good
money.

Africa has had great sons and daughters
who inspired the liberation of our conti-
nent and who deserve to be remembered:
Kwame Nkrumah, Kenneth Kaunda,
Julius Nyerere Albert Luthuli, Sekou
te dh ae Hake Selassie,
ro eagediane, Patrice Lumumba,
