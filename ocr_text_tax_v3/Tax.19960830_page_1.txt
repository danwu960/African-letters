DURING the course of
last week, Stocks &
Stocks Namibia (Pty)
Ltd issued a lengthy
statement in which the
firm attempted to throw
some light on the history
of certain projects which
they constructed or for
which they submitted
tenders. These projects
include, among others,
the Brendan Simbwaye
Square office block, the
Bank of Namibia build-
ing and the proposed
Government Office
Park.

Reference is made to
the role which I am al-
leged to have played in
precipitating certain de-
cisions, for instance with
regard to the award of
the contract for the erec-
tion of the Bank of Na-

NamDeb Donation nj<,..;..

mibia Building. It js also
implied that I have fer-
vently opposed the con.
struction of the Govern.
ment Office Park,

I would like to Clarify
merely three issues:

!. The award of the
Bank of Namibia build.
ing contract to the Inter-
national/Grinaker
Constortium remains to
be in the best interest of
both our Client and the
Namibian taxpayer
without a shadow of a
doubt. Since Stocks and
Stocks Namibia (Pty)
Ltd appears dissatisfied
with the award, they
should of course fecl at
liberty to institute such
remedial action as they

consider appropriate.
2. Concerming my at-
titude with regard to the

Construction of the Goy.-
¢mment Office Park. |
Said the following |

Parliament about this
Project on April 12
1996: “To accuse us of
being OPPosed to any
kind of development Is

will suppo investme
and developments of
any kind,

Sary tO invest wise, a

80 about development in
a circumspect
Little is wronp wi
PMNciple of the Govern-
ment Office Park but
everything js wrong
with the immoderate
methods CNVisaged to
bring itto reality ... Gov-
emment has nothing to
lose but Cverything to
&ain by taking a rational
and well balanced deci-

faidcooi z

sion Conceming the im-
Plementation Of this
Project.”

The Tecords of i

Statement. I stand b
what I said. 4
