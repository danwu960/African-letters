Only for
Windhoek

ALLOW me to air my views
about the Government funded
newspaper, New Era.

' Before the newspaper was
launched, the Ministry of In-
formation and Broadcasting
under which the papers resorts,
said it would cantain news from
all over the country.

When paging through New
Era I see that it consists mostly
of happenings in Windhoek.
Why? Remember that it is
taxpayers money that is being
used. We as taxpayers want to
see news and photographs from
Oranjemund in the south to
Caprivi in the north east; from
Opuwo and Khosixas and

to see these people in focus,
not just people’ in Windhoek
attending state or diplomatic
functions.

Recently there were demon-
strations in Tsumeb by women
against drug and alcohol abuse.
It was covered poorly although
a reporter from New Era from

ntein was present.

Purthermore the newspaper
Caly covers sports events in
Windhoek because these are
the newspaper is not for all the
People but only Windhoek
residents. Please see to it that
the sports events throughout

the country are covered,
