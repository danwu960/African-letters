A Cover-Up Culture

PLEASE allow) me
space in your estocmod
he wspaper to raise LOM
questions regarding the
subject of the ‘wedding
of the millennium’ of
i Abraham lyambo
In Namibia a cover-
up culture 1s taking root
the shicld the top cch-
clons and to demon
strate this, I fail to un-
derstand why the Pume
Minister (who 1s sup
posed lo drive the cam-
Pargn against corrup-
on) adopts an attitude
of “the Minister should
be given an oppodunity
to explain himscif.
Picasc. Mr PM, tell
the nation plainly
whether the maticr 1s
closed after the expla-
navon of Dr lyambo
The following ques-
tons are directed to Dr
lyambo, Joan Gurtras,
the Auditor General and
the Ombudsman: °
There are certain rules
that govern donations
and as fas as my know!l-
edgc 1s concerned. only
chantable organisations
are allowed to open ac-
counts without registict-
ing but have to be regis-
tered with the Ministry
of Health and Soctal
Services. In view of this,
how was the account in
which donations were
received for the wed-
ding. opened? * What is
the name of the account?
* Is the account which
1s reported to have con-
tained about N$ 140000,
taxable? * Who was au-
thorised to sign and
withdrawn the moncy

and hy whom? * How
much was withdrawn
and what was st spent
on? We would like a
detailed account. * What
was the contribution of
anyone who gave ado
natron, whether asked to
do so of done on his
own accord? What was
Dr lyambo's own con-
tnbution” © How much
was spent at the ccr-
emony in Swakopmund
and how much tn the
north? What were Dr
lyambo's owncontnbe-
trons”? * What is the bal
ance in the account? °
To open the account at
whatever banking insts-
tutron oac has to have
idenuficatron proof, cer-
tain documents and cer-
tain bank mules have to
be satisfied before the
account is opened. Who
submitted this? * If any
amount remained as a
balance in this account,
will it now be trans-
ferred to the personal
account of Dr lyambo
since the donations were
has. or what will happen
to the amount? * Why
were the donations in
the form of cash in the
first instance not di-
rectly paid into Dr
lyambo’s bank account?
* Whose decision was it
{9 Open an account in
which the cash dona-
tions would be paid and
not to use the existing
account of the Minis-
ter?

If the Minister wants
to be taken seriously and
believed by us, he must

The request above ws
in line with Anicte 18
of the Constitution thag
administrative bodies
and officials shall acy
fairly and tcasonably
and comply with the re.
quirements imposed
upon such bodies by
common law and any
relevant legislation |.
The altention of Dr
Tyambo 1s also drawnto
Articles 41 and 42 of
the Constitution which
state: “All Munisters
shall be accountable tn-
dividual for the admin-
istration of ther own
ministnes and collec-
tively for the adminis-
tration of the work of
Cabinet. both to the
President and to Partia-
ment” and “ministers
May mx take up any
other paid employment,

consistent with their po-
sitions as Ministers or

any situation whieh car
ries with at the risk ofa

conflict developing be-
tween their interests as

hand to all newspapers Ministers and the pri-

vate interests”.

We know by now that
the Minister won't be
asked to vacate his post.

The government must
do the honourable thing
and transfer him to an-
other position. His as-
surance that he as not
cormupuble would not be
accepted until the inves-
tigation against him és
finalised and the out-
come known.

The newspapers also
have a duty to conduct
an independent probe
and make known the
outcome without fear or
favour.

Lastly, 1 admire the
work done by The Na-
mibtan to expose cor-
ruption, greed and self-
ennchment.
