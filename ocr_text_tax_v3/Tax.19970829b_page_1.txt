| ‘Gambling’ With
Our Funds ...

]
. [CHOOSE to comment publicly on recent Cabinet
- decisions concerning retirement benefits for senior
N political office bearers and the reversal of salary
a increments given to civil servants.

Many civil servants are already affected by the
A latter as increments received since Apnl 1997 are to
+ he recovered and salary notches reversed as before
date of increment.

The same Cabinct hired “financtal experts” with
taxpayers’ money to draw up the performance up-
. praisal document and the WASCOM report pron
ised a ten percent (10%) salary increasc with effect
sf from | Apnl 1997 and then kept silent.

In my opinion the reason for such harsh decision
ny would be the unexpected availability of jobs for ex-
4\- combatants in the public service, the recent demon-
in- stration by unhappy nursing staff or the unavailabil-
‘If ity of funds to finance the reurement benefits for
ind senior political office bearers. .
Cabinet agrecd to “gamble” without concen! with
is- our pension fund which is our only benefit in the
the grey-haired years ahead, yet they sccm {0 be con-
Be- cerned only about their retirement years.
ald = Few elderly citizens in our beloved country sur-
BCY vive on pension-payouts by government at this MO-
ment but it does not concem the Cabinet members.

Unless the government comes clean on their deci-
sions I am of the opinion that civil servants 10
ec. Namibia are used to the benefit of their bosses

_ that goes for every taxpayer in the Republic of
on. Namibia. ‘
