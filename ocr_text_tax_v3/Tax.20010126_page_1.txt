- No More War Or Corruption:

Re “NHE ftravd hungpia
freed” (The Namibsan, 12
2001), this news
venele abet Mr Axzaro
Tsowasch is once again
tangible proof that the
Govemment encourages
fraud by public officials.
How clse in the workd
could it be cxplained that
fos more than two years
Mr Nujyoma allowed
Axaro Tsowaseb, a con.
victed felon, to blk) the
Nanubian people out of
milhons of dollars in un-
eamed salanes while he
was not working? And, to
add insult to injury: even
as a convict, Axaro was
not fired. No, he was asked
to “agree” to “resign”?!
Moreover, as if this wasn't
ignation, an agreement
with the Nujoma govern-
ment, cost the poor
Namibian taxpayer N$2
million!!!

There is absolutely a0
single good reason for pey-
ing a crook a salary while
he is lad off for his vile
acts. Nor docs it make any
sense to pay him N$2 mil-
lion to let tum go. Unless
you want to encourage this
sort of thing, the fact that
money under his watch
disappeared is clearly
enough reason to fire him

If the Nujoma govern-
mentreally cared about the
Namibian people instead
of the stomachs of its clites,
it would, if an official is
confronted with credible
evidence of malfeasance

Chough to evea try it.

However, the the sto-
rics of stealing keep trick-

hing out of the Nejoma Ad-
ministration while he rc-
mains mem and even
Prauses the thief. Take, for
instance, the case of Mr
Abraham lyambo, the
Minister of Fisheries, and
those questionable pay-
ments (bribes, if you wit!)
for his wedding that were
paid for by people who
oced his approval to stay
in business.

Them there's the N$25
milton that weet through
Quando Holdings, a
Swapo company, suppos-
edly in rouse w the Demo-
cratic Repeblic of Congo
and disappeared without a
trace. There’s, of course,
no good ranonale why this

wT we —_ -~

putauve gift of the people
of Nanubia to the people
of Congo could not have
been transterred through
the good offices of both
governments. Instead, the
Goverment’s money was
diverted into Swapo's
hands (Quando Holdings
and Swapo are the same
thing ) and disappeared.
Once agan. isn’t President
Nuyoma cunous at all?
Corrupnon is an insidi-
ous malady that, if it isn't
faced head-on, will se-
verely retard our country’s
economic development.
Therefore, unless he is re-
ally seriously wanting to
fight corruption, President
Nujoma should not yet
exchange driving a
Mercedes for a Chevrolet,
as he recently proposed
while he was vacationing
at Swakopmund. Unless it
is past of an overall anti-
graft package, driving a
Chevy would be worst than
pinpricks since it is not
likely to make a dent in
corruption by itself. It will
maslead the Namibian poo-
plc into thinking tha: some-
thing is being done to con-
tol excessive spending.
This false sense of accom-
plishment will lull the pub-
lic into complacency and
thus aggravate corruption
If he wished to well for
Namibia, President
Nujoma can use the very
same dictatorial power that
he $0 foolishly wielded in
sending our soldiers to be
killed in Congo and An-
