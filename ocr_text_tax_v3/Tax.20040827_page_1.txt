An Insult To The Nation

PLEASE allow me space in your
newspaper to air my views concern-
ing the article of 12 August 2004,
“Government should not be blamed
for abuse by civil servants.”

That statement is an insult to the
Namibian nation.

If we don’t blame our government
then who should be blamed? It seems
like the government only wants to be
our government when they are eat-
ing Our money through tax, when it
comes to taking responsibility they
are in denial, they forget that they
are tn their chairs because of us, the
tax payers.

When will government recognise
the work of NSHR who are educating
Namibians about their rights; they
have even published many different
books in different languages. If there
was no such education then the abuse
of basic human rights would be worse
than currently.

Those who don’t recognise that

NSHR are in fact is doing someing
ignominious and are denying what is
contained in the report. We citizens
know whatis happening in this country
and we are not blind. The time will
come when the government cannot
deny the truth anymore.

The deterioration of human rights in
this country is causing and increasing
unemployment, poverty, huunger and
disease. The NSHR is just behind the
truth, let the NSHR team do their
job without fear and threats from
anyone.

We cannot tolerate the fact that our
economy is feeding our leaders and
we the nation who are in majority and
who put them in power are living in
poverty. Without the NSHR team we
would not have known these things.
I therefore, congratulate you people
from NSHR.
