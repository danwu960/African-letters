Provoke Reactions

AFTER receiving my tax invoice for
the period ended 15 July, I noticed that
you [Municipality] have charged me an
amount of N$103,22 for “Open Space
and street cleaning’’. Before ZOIng into
this matter, I waited for the response to
the various quenes directed to you via
the media and other instances. But what

a farce this turned out to be.

The explanations offered by your Mr
Nehinamwaami were so absurd and
ndiculous, that Iam left with no other
alternative but to direct this matter di-
rectly to you (Municipality).

My total assessment rates for the
period ended June 15 2003 amounted to
N$350,43, which amount included the
so-called OSSC charges, if your Mr.

Nghinamwaami is to be believed. The
amount for the period ended July 15
2003 is N$473,74, an increase of
N$123,31 or 35,18%. To top it all, the
new property valuations are noteven in
force yet.

I know that in Namibia today, many
people are being regarded and labelled
as baboons, but, my dear Sir, this
baboon knows when itis taken for aride
or being ripped off. Awareness-rais-
ing! Do not make me laugh. You people
underestimate the intelligence of your
town’s inhabitants. Why can you not
stand up for your mistakes instead of

making them even worse by trying to
Justify and excusing your faulty deci-
sions with inaccuracies and remarks
like “transparency “ etc. Windhoek is
becoming a damn unattractive town to
invest in, contrary to what you always
trumpet in the newspapers.
But knowing the smbbornness of you
and your Council and the fact that you
will not listen to or take notice of the

Beneral Public's reaction on this matter
haw nave now resolved the following: I
my pro ys | ad five 200 litre drums on

perty tn which I stored my garden
refuse and which I dumped at the desig-
nas dumping Sites when they were full.
nawane out officials have now made me

eof the fact that I have been
Paying for the open space cleaning all the
ume while wasting my time and peuol to
keep the same open spaces clean, Ihave
now decided to dump my weckly garden
refuse on those spaces for you to clean.
After all, lam paying you people for just
that This will negate the effect of the
35,18 per cent increase a little bit. Please
do not say to me that this ts illegal, as
your charge for this service would then
also be deemed illegal. Furthermore, any
cigarette and/or cool drink tin will from
now on be dumped onto the streets from
my car, as I am also paying for the
cleaning thereof.

I must after all get something out of
something that I pay for. I just wanted to
let you know of my transparent decision.
You will probably argue that this is a
stupid reaction, but let me tell you the law
according to Newton: “For every action
there is an equal but opposite reaction .
Think about that for a while. If you peo-

ple want to improve your Council's bank
accounts, I would advise you to stop
financing useless institutions and bodies
like the Khomas Regional Council. The
only productive act they and Mr. Pandeni

have performed to date is when they have
to travel to your offices to collect the

monthly finances needed for their lavish
lifestyles.
