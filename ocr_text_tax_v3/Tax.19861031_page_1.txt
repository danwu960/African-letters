town of Oranjemund and in the labour
camps called hostels, were asked to
take part in the celebrations. The re-
quest was seen by the Namibian
workers as an insult in that it re-
quested them to take part in
celebrating an event commemorating
the colonial diposseesion of the Nami-
bian people and exploitation of our
country. The town came into existence
as aresult of the labour of workers who
have contributed so much but have not
been justly rewarded. The town 1s
therefore inextricably linked to the
mine. It is also not an exaggeration to
assert that without the Namibian
migrant workers, the town in question
would not have been established.

The celebration must be exposed for
what it is The settlers are not
celebrating the birth of the town of
Oranjemund, but the more than 50
years of plundering one of our most
valuable resources by CDM and the
government of the colonial power.

It was diamonds from CDM which
have principally fuelled the colonia!
machine over the past 70 years. Nami-
bian workers recall with a deep sense
of anguish the fact that during the 60s
and early 70s CDM generated an
average of 75 percent of mining sector
taxation.

Workers are aware that companies
like CDM are anxious to strip the coun-
try bare before a government of the peo-
ple can bring its natural resources
under its control. CDM, for instance,
hasinthe late 1970s, maintained pro-
duction at 25 percent above average
levels. It has and is still, overmining.

It is even an open secret that CDM is
going all-out with a round-the-clock
three-shift m to raise output to
the highest possible level. Such is de
Beers tight control over diamond
marketing that not even South Africa
can check whether it has secretly

gems from
Oranjemund. These and other exports,
are illegal in terms of the Interna-
tional Court of Justice verdict of 1971
and UN Decree Number 1 on natural
resources of Namibia,

eanplayess are act entitied tee pension
scheme.

Teaining is a mere shew and of
cosmetic nature. Ag a resuit, mest, if
net all, black workers are unskilled
and de unaiilled labour.

With such a state of affairs, we the
Namibian workers are CDM, fei that
we are not party to such acelebration.
We have nothing to celebrate.

To us the 50th birthday of Orange-
round is a reminder of 50 years of ex-
of the Namibian people
