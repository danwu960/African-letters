Corruption

AS faras lam concemed and to the best of
my knowledge corruption is the practice
of stealing in a given administrative sys-
tem. In this practice persons tn positions of
authority abuse power to either steal, de-
fraud or accept bribes for personal finan-
cial gain to maintain a specific standard of
living.

The primary objective is that politicians
and political appointees are very uncertain
of their careers, since in some cases they
handle the positions effectively and effi-
ciently. Once again in the event of those
appointed in lower positions the wages are
very low or altematively they are being
used as part and parcel of syndicates to
facilitate corrupt practices, simply because
they are entrusted with certain responsi-
bilities. Therefore, in my opinion we donâ€™t
need a new law on stealing, because it is
misconduct or any unprecedented prac-
tice as stipulated in the code of conduct or
rules and regulations of any given institu-
tion. Furthermore, the Namibian Consti-
tution clearly stipulates that nobody is
above this supreme law and could be
prosecuted for whatever offence commit-
ted, especially in the true spirit and sense
of our democracy. Otherwise, you are
exempting several political figures and
their followers from being prosecuted and

subsequently allowing them to steal, to be
bnbed an to defraud companies. etc.

We could have rather introduced stiffer
sentences for corruption and _ stealing
against any person who makes himself
guilty thereof. | support the views and
proposals of those Parliamentarians who
said that the National Assembly and the
Judges should be involved with the ap-
pointment of Directors and Investigating
Officers respectively. We have seen what
happened in many African and other coun-
ines according to the listing by Transpar-
ency International. Is that not a sufficient
wake-up call to advance our democratic
governance? Is it not again establishing a
Truth and Reconciliation Commission to
hear atrocities committed by certain re-
gimes and political parties, if you exempt
certain leaders from prosecution?

Finally, I welcome the constructive con-
tnbutions being made by some Parliamen-
tarians to ensure that it becomes a law for
all Namibians. I therefore suggest that the
Bill be referred to public hearings, since in
most cases we are talking about and deal-
ing with public funds/taxpayers money
etc. | hope we will find an amicable solu-
tion as real democrats.
