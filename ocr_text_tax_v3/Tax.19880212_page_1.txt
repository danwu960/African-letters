We, the living

LAM very concerned about unemploy-
ment and the standard of living affec-
ting us black people. I wish to appeal
to those involved in the

nt that the time has come to
get serious. .

Why must we hear that there are no
jobe for thoee who need them most,
while unnecessary jobs are provided
for others in the unelected interim
government? I wonder whether the in-
terim government really cares about
the well-being of their countrymen.

Our standard of living is very low
and there are many shortages.

Have you, socalled Ministers, been
here in Katutura and in other black
townships of Namibia? If the answer
is ‘yes’, then why dont you fight our
cause with the South African Govern-
ment for the sake of your countrymen?

Unemployment is unnecessary ina
country such as this. There are also a
lot of potential jobs around the
townships for blacks.

Just pay a short visit here to
Katutura to see what | am talking
about. I want to to Moses of
Manpower to provi jobs for his coun-
trymen, You can provide jobs by hav-
ing a park project for Katutura and pro-
per playgrounds for our kids.

You could also launch a project for the
planting of treesin certain areas toim-
prove Katutura.

To quote from history, perhaps you
might refer back to Franklin
Rooseveldt andhis New Deal for some
tips.

Please don’t fool us by telling usthat
the money isnot available. Our mines
are full of raw materials which are ex-
ploited by South Africa. Then youtell
us there’s no money?

All Khomasdal streets are tarred.
Why not Katutura? Don’t tell me about
money. I am aware that our taxes are
not the same as the residents of
Khomasdal or those of W indhoek, but
why can't we get even cheap tarred
roads just to keep the dust away. Isthis
a case of ‘equal rights. |

Irepeat my concern about unempiloy-
mentand the law standard of living of
many blacks, particularly the

 Ovambo-speaking people.
