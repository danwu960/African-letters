Sheyapo’s Apology OK But

ITIS worth noting that it has taken Mr Sheyapo some ten days
of solid silence to apologise for his public remarks on Namibian
womenfolk vis-a-vis their relationships with foreigners and the
‘kiss and tell’ remarks.

Whichever side of the divide you took on the ensuing sequel!
to the remarks, one fundamental issue remains clear and that is:
itis cnough tosay ‘I am sorry’ while the substance of the apology
remains in the heart. The recent appointment of only two women
to Swapo’s Central Committee (by the President) is a clear
indication of the double-standards and the dichotomy between
deeds and words from the political class.

Namibia is indeed a very nice and peaceful country (as has
been manifested by the short-term experience in democracy) but
it is certainly not immune from ‘political correctness’ that even
the world’s most powerful democracy often falls prey to. Even
President Bush goofed when he asked his countrymen to read his
lips (when interviewed on tax issues in the pre-election cam-
paign).

For issues such as family choice and other matte
to become a target issue for domestic politics are o
ary tactics from redressing more pressing issues.
entitled to his speech as enshrined in the country’s Constitution
(mindful of how others are affected) so also are all of us Who have
reacted one way or another subsequently. But if he had not made
that remark, then his heart would not have been bared to the
realisation. Since the Bill under consideration at the time of this
remarks, the Namibian Central Intelligence Bill, calls for utmost

secrecy, am | then wrong to presuppose that Mr Shey apo is feeling

uncomfortable for verbalising an already Proposed modus oper.

As a foreigner married to a Namibian, suffi
