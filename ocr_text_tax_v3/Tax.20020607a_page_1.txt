Approve Monies To S

IT is indisputable that
nowadays Government
infrastructure ©€.8.
school hostels, hospital
wards, military bunga-
lowsetc. are in ruins due
to vandalism or just be-
cause of age or because
maintenance is lacking.

sks any relevant

money’.

I suggest that parlia-
ment should pass a law
which will approve
money to maintain our
new and old infrastruc-
ture.

History has taught us

ave GRN Structures

that if one builds infra-
structure, one ought to be
ready for the maintenance
if development is the pri-
ority of priorities and for
the taxpayers’ efforts not
to be in vain.
