Karibib complaints

| AM CALLING on the socalled
interim government to direct their
attention to the following:

We, the people of Karibib, are
sick and tired of baasskap by the
whites. We cannot accept
everything the white man tells us.

We are sick and tired of toilet
pots which are carried out by our
people in the black township. It 3s
a health hazard to both the carriers
and the local people.

Lots of diseases are caused by
this. We want the same toilets as
those used by the white man. We
want flush toilets. |

Karirib is one of the oldest places
in Namibia but it is not developed.
The houses are old and in a state

of collapse, Taps are closed down
and one has to walk a distance to
get water. White people are

notified if there are problems with
water supplies, but black people are

} not notified.

_. Why must we suffer like this?

Why must another human being

varity a -aiftérent skin colour be

“superior? ms
