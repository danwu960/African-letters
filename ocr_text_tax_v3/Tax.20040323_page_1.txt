Fewer Hate
Speeches, Please!

NAMIBIAN voters have a right to be informed in order
to cast their votes with commitment and maturity as
far as their future is concerned. [t is in that context that
we - again - request “leaders” to stick to the rules of
democracy and free and fair elections.

Mr. Tjiriange, your previous position as Minister of
Justice should have instilled a respect for the Namibian
Constitution in you. That should at least reach as far as
knowing that it is NOT SWAPO that created the
Namibian Defence Force, Police, Civil Service etc. etc.
- that is an obligation every Government of a country
has.

Swapo is just another political party and not the
Government. Sir - we do not live in 1960 anymore - the
year 2004 is here and we have and want to move on.

We all have an understanding that you might still
feel bitter about your past - let us, however, look ahead
and rather work for a future that does not bring back
those years. Namibia has so many problems that need
tangible solutions. Solutions will not be found by clinging
on to the past and asking weird questions like: “What
did Ben Ulenga tell the Boers to be released?”

Absurd statements like “the CoD has been created
by colonialists”’.

By the way, Sir, the CoD is a legitimate political
party and not an organisation. You can condemn the
“colonisers” till eternity - as long as you, the Swapo
party, still depend on them for food assistance for
Namibians your statements boomerang.

Tell the voters why is it necessary to apply for N$37.7
million donor assistance to feed Namibians?

Tell the voters why only foreigners get major building
contracts these days?

Tell the voters why they - after 14 years of
independence - still live in shacks and shambles?

Why is almost every municipality bankrupt in
Namibia? .

Why is each and every parastatal costing the
Namibian taxpayers millions and millions?

Sir - youas former Minister of Justice - should cry out
loud: babies and toddlers are raped on a daily basis.
Criminals rule the country - Namibians get murdered
for a few dollars - corruption never gets punished.

The list, | am afraid, is endless! The Police force is ill
equipped, ill-trained - why would Windhoek otherwise
ask for a Municipal Police Force?

The Namibian Defence Force - who is insane enough
to want to attack Namibia - Namibia does not need that
Force. The moncy could be spent on housing/education/
health services etc. etc. All these and many more
pressing issues and what can be done about it.

That makes up election material for many months -
Sir - not your defamations and agitating hate speeches.

However - if your attacks on the CoD are an indicator
to go by - the CoD is doing a good job and giving you
ample reason to see an opposition in that party.

Mr. Tjiriange, please come up with solutions for
Namibians since we all know that the tax payers ~ and
that includes opposition party members - pay for Swapo
rallies.

We have peace in Namibia - that is also a credit to
Opposition parties since we can argue in parliament
and don't have to take up weapons - let’s keep it that
way, please, and let’s tackle Namibia’s multiple
problems together.

Create a platform for FREE and FAIR elections.
