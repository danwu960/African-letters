On ‘the hunted’

1AM a regular reader of your paper,
feeling the need to be broadly inform.
ed. also on issues and events which are
oer neglected or distorted by other

Pleas quite shocked though, when be-

ing confronted with your article

and the Hunted’ by M Ver-

bean and the editorial ‘A threatened

ecayle (Both in The Namibian of Oc-
tober 16).

These two contributions tothe topic
of Bushmanland appear so superficial
and without any background know-
lodge by the writers that I feel obliged
to comment. The only purpose of the
said contributions seems to be one of
sensationalism and propagandism
aimed at belittling and degrading the
interim government - at the cost of
sound reporting on the Bushmans’
plight and the different possible and
realistic alternatives.

Though | share your views on the 1!
legitimacy of the interim government
and on soonest implementation of in
ternationally recognised in
dependence, I do not think that this
warrants bad journalism aiming at
political gain - especially ona subject
asimportant for part ofthe Namibian
nation as this one

In my opinion, the main statement
ig a positive one, namely, that the
region will not be proclaimed a game
reserve This is what the argument was
going on about and what concerned

had feared would happen. Your
statement “the Cabinet are obvious.
ly going to have to lure the prime
trophy animals such as lion and
elephant into Bushmanland” ia quite
nidiculous. The “game such aslion and
elephant” are NOT “going to flock to
the area” ss M Verbaan states, because
theee species are already abundantly
present in Bushmaniand.

This is exactly the problem the
Bushman are faced with all the time!
The only possible sol ution would thus
seem a reduction in numbers by hun-
ting. Possibly a very small percentage
could be lured out into Koudom game
reserve by additional water holes
there.

editorial

The “season” for trophy hunting
comprises virtually the whole vear, no
flood of rifle-toting hunters ig involv:
ed asis possible during our two month
“biltong- hunting season” and no
spotlights are used whatsoever, a3 is
the case during the night-culling
operations

This very individualised. exclusive
trophy-hunting reaultsinthe highest
income per hunted animal. while the
hunting operation itself is the best
paid tourist activity in the country -
and all this in foreign currency.

lam stating these facts after nine
years’ experience as a professional
hunting guide. Ihave also, at the bein.
ning of this month, visited
Bushmanland for six days: NOT toget
a hunting concession, but to inform
myself

During aconversation with Mr Mar.
shall of the Bushman Foundation, he
himselfcaiculated that the income for
one trophy elephant would pay for the
installation ofa complete cattle drink.
ing point - IF the income goes to the
benefit of the Bushmen. And this, I
believe, isthe point where work has to
be done - namely to ensure proper
distribution of the income generated,
so aa to benefit the Bushman
population.

Asfer as! know, Mr Hartung, he too
would see this matter in the same
light, and I would in general agree
with you that - ifsc littleconsultation
with the population and the experts
has taken place - this is not acceptable,
though this does not at the same time
make the decision taken a bed one.

It certainly isa better solution than
the practice inb the ‘good old dayn’
when one of the present day interim
government ministers took it upon

himselfto‘‘freethe population ofsuch’
problem animals’ on taxpayers’ ex-
pense by shooting from an army
helicopter.
