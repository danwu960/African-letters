NBC May Be Sued
For Biased Reporting

RECENT reporting on the
NBC has demonstrated
biased information that
does not reflect the ethics
of good journalism. An
Organisation charged with
such an important respon.
sibilily to inform (and not
misinform) the nation is
currently viewed as be-
INR More concemed with
sensation rather than re-

bulletin, it was reported
that seven people were
caught at the Windhock
Intemational Airport in
possession of stolen air
tckets and Kenyan pass-
ports. These peaple were
reported to have ined to
board Air Namibia to
Europe. They were how-
ever caught in the process
and their passports con-
fiscated for screening
having confirmed they
possessed stolen tickets.

This story, sensational!
enough in my personal
view, apparently lacked
cnough lustre in the
NBC's newsroom. There-
fore, to make it more
thrilling, the Nigerian is-
sue had to be brought in,
even though the national-
ity of the culprit had not
been confirmed.

It my personal opinion
that NBC lacks the neces-
sary skilled personne! in
carrying out its duty in an
effective and professional
manner. The organisation
should be restructured to
accommodate competent
staff be it Namibian or
foreign. This will save the
establishment (NBC) and

ment in the court of law.

The organisation has
predictably displayed in-
consistency in executing
its duties by engaging in

biased reporting. This has
undermined its critical
role in furnishing the na-
tion, and more impor-
tantly, NBC listeners with
useful information.

Nigeria had always
been the black sheep in
is spectacular reporung
on fraud-related news.
There fore, the quesuon in
my mind as a Namibian
who lived for fifteen years
in Nigeria is whether there
is nO good news to be
teported about Nigeria?
Every good skill I pos-
sess today, [leamt when I
was in Nigeria and these
have really helped me in
the capacity in which |
am presently serving my
country (Namibia). [am
quile sure many top gov-
eroment officials who
were in Nigena willagree
with me.

Itis my belief that most
of these biased reporters
have never visited Nigeria
before neither do they rt
have an in-depth picture 5
of the situation in that ©
country. They should |
therefore conduct critical
investigations before eg-
gaging in such destruo-
tive reporting that has
constantly undermined
the integrity of the avers”:
