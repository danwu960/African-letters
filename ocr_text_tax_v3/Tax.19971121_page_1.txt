in the aforementioned
article itis stated that your

Ministry has apparently
asked six different parties
for proposals for a pro-

Up to now,

Honourable Minister, |
and all the other private
lodge owners in Namibia
want lo capress our total
OPPosttion Co those project
because:

ef your manistry con-
siders such a project why
sve not given Oulton pub-
lic tender so that every-
body has a chance?

° Jf your ministry al-
lows the first project of
sucha nature than for sure
more will follow, all by
invitation and without
public tenders.

* We, the private lodge
owners have and are in-
vesting vast amounts of
money in order to accom-
modate tourists. The
Money we mvestis money
Icft after we have paid our
due taxes to government
and 1S again attracting
money to both private and
public enterprises. Please
also remember how many
New jobs we are creating,
direcUy and indirectly.

* How big will the im-

ings of Namutoni if even
a small lodge is to be
erected” The environment
around Namutons ts very
brittle and sensitive.

* Would tt not be better
to have an environmental
and ecological impact
study before such an un-
dertaking is etfected”

It is my sincere wish -

be a better way to find a
solution on a long term
basis in regard to accom-
modaton im and around
the Etosha Game Reserve,
Picase reconsider your
ministry's proposal and ket
us work together for a
better and more sustain.
