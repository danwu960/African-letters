Scandalous
accusation

MY attention is drawn to the letter
entitled ‘Foreigner's woes’ by a cer-
tain Mrs Cox of Olympia which
appeared in The Namibian of No-
vember 19.

Mrs Cox claims to have come to
Namibia six months ago with ‘the
intention of establishing a legitimate
business’’. She was however, gur-
prised to have been told to call back
after three months for the work per-
mit which she is yet to receive,

Mrs Cox also put several questions
to the readers, such as:

- she does not know the reason for
the duration required for the process-
ing of passportkitizenship documents,
According to her three months is too
long and extensions if necessary, are :
not acceptable to her.

- Mrs Cox does not feel officers of

| the Ministry of Home Affairs have

| the nght to satisfy themselves in
accordance with their job descnip-
tion, whether such information is
contained in the application forms or |
not; |

- she felt the Ministry is practising
delaying tactics and wantsthe Minis- |
ter of Home Affairs to ‘call his offi- |

cials to order’. ,
According toher, Namibians were |
not treated in the same way in her |
country which she has not named. |
These scandalous accusations di-
rected against our Goverment and
our law enforcement agency cannot
go unchallenged.
First of all, the socalled Mrs Cox
| fatled to state her full name and address,
her country of origin and the type of
business she wants to undertake in
Namibia.
Secondly, official documents are
not just dished out anyhow, espe-
| Cially to foreigners, whether it be
passport, identity card, citizenship,
residential ahd work permits (that
may be dong in the country Mrs Cox
comes from), |
