THANK you for your column ‘‘Politi-
cal Perspective” of Friday February 4.

Thave been acivil servant for the past
eight years. Sometimes one feels so
down just at the thought that civil serv-
ants do not get any increase or even a
bonus. We live far beneath the bread
line because of debts and no one thinks
of giving us an extra cheque toclear our
debts. We have to buy everything on
credit to try and survive because there
is never any cash available.

As civil seryants, we have only one
| form of inicome’and if we want to do
other business we first have to get per-
mission from the public service, and
then this income 1s also taxed. I gota
Wascom cheque of about N$9 000 last
year which was taxed to N$4 000. Why
can't they tax these big cheques of the
leaders? This is very unfair toward the
ordinary worker...

You work for a month and at the end
of it, youdon’teven have enough money
to pay your debts. Some days you don’t
even have money for a loaf of bread or
to pay the taxi to come to work. Some-
times people can no longer bear the

The Civil Servant And
The Gravy Train

suffenng of their children.

The wealthy leaders of this country
should keep in mind that these are some
of the reasons why some people com-
mit suicide.

The price of everything in life in-
creases: taxis, bread, milk. The one
thing that does not increase ts the civil
servant's salary.

When will the Prime Minister, his
deputy, other ministers and deputy min-
isters, and the MPs campaign for an
increase in our salaries and even a bo-
nus? Never, because they do not care, as
Jong as their gravy train runs smoothly.

Please your honourables, start think -
ingabout your fellow Namibrans Please
don’ ttell usevery time thatitis notonly
the Government's duty to help. We try
to help ourselves, but how can we if our
salaries stay the same from year to year.
We try to be efficient and effective civil
servants, but the Government does noth-
ing from its side to encourage their
workers.
