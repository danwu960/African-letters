' ‘Health, Not Strike,
= The Cause Of TCL Ills’

snot THIS is my opinion on disappearance of such a
how the money of large consignment ex-

vhat Tsumeb Corporation
vant Limited should be han-
ner died.

op 1. All money which 1s
side owed to workers, people

do affected by illnesses
which were caused by
the mine and who cannot
work anymore as a result,
of persons who would
not be able to work in
future because of this,
has to be paid to these
affected persons. These
people have to be looked
after in the future years
when they would sull
have worked.

2. All taxes owed by
TCL have to be recov-
ered. In the same way,
preference should be
given to paying out the
back wages of TCL em-
ployecs.

3. The disappearance
of the Chilean copper
concentrate which was
sent to Tsumeb to be re-
fined at the TCL smelter

is a very senous matter
and has to be invest-
gated. It was also negli-
gent not to insure the
concentrate. The mere

plains nothing. This also
applies to (major TCL
creditor) Standard Bank
of Namibia - they should
have taken out insurance
to cover their losses. Af-
ter all, when I buy a car
or take up a loan, I have
to take out insurance be-
cause if something then
happens to me I will be
fully covered.

4. Gold Fields South
Afnca has a ot of re-
sponsibiliues to former
employees who are ill
and who will in future
fall ill, where their illness
has not been detected yet
(They say it can take up
to ten or fifteen years for
the symptoms of mining-
related illnesses to show,
except where a worker
was unprotected and in
which case it can take
less than a year.)

I would recommend
that all the money which
is left should not be paid
out, but should be depos-
ited into a fund until the
fifteen year period has
passed, for more in-
stances of ill-health

caused by employment at
TCL which might sull
occur.

What nauseates me.
too, are the frequent ref-
erences to the 1996 stnke
which was supposedly
the cause of the minc’s
problems. This ts in fact
not true. The largest
problem in fact was that

cause of this the trregu-
lanties occurred where
permission was given to
the cementation section
to dnl dry - then they arc
not there anymore and it
can simply be said the
person died of a heart at-
tack, which 1s also true
because this illness after
all also affects the hean

people were getting so iil. which works together
and that TCL are not with the lungs.
