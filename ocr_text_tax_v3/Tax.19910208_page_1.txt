Women on tax

I WOULD like the Finance
Minister, Dr Otto Herrigel, to
clarify a few points concem-
ing the article ‘Women to benefit
from tax changes’ in The
Namibian of Monday Jamary
27.

The article said that there
will be changes in the current
discrimination against women,
particularly marmed women.
My questions are:

- why is the emphasis only
on married women? Is is be-
cause unmarried women do not
pay taxes or is it because they
are not discriminated against?

this regard?
