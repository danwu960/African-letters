No Petrol
Problem,
It Seems!

JUST a short observation
by aconcerned citizen and
taxpayer.

Friday, 23.01.98, a white
Toyota Bakkie, licence
plate GRN 12338, Minis-
try of Agriculture, which
had a big additional petro!
tank on the back was park-
ing in Krupp Street and the
petrol out of this back-up
tank was pouring, not drip-
ping, out of the filling noz-
zle of this tank, because it
was standing in full sun.

Informing the staff and

visitors of the business, in
front of which the car was
standing, most of the peo-
ple were not interested.
Except for one staff mem-
ber who went to inform
the driver, I received com-
ments like “They have
enough money ...”

I was shocked by these
reacuons: * Does every-
body feel the tax payers
money is not worth sav-
ing? * Are the drivers of
govemment cars so un-
trained, that they do not
know the expansion of
petrol in sun heated tanks?

:* Does care about the pol-
‘lution, which is the thing
‘that worried me in the first

rn an 0) I stopped?
