Personal Notices Cost Taxpayer

DR Nickey Iyambo did a most noble
thing in publicly expressing his personal
thanks ‘to those people and institutions
that stood by him during the passimg of
his wife. What distracts from the per-
ceived sincerity of this, however, is the
fact that his word of thanks is headed by
the official banner of the Ministry of
Regional and Local Government. As sach,
the placing of the block-add was most
likely paid for by the taxpayer.
I do not know what The Namibian
charges per column/cenumetre in a case
like this, but let us assume a charge of

N$5,00 per column/cm and we arrive af a
ice tag of N$500,00. Should this ad be
ndhoek newspapers at

out-of-pocket some N$2500,00. If the
rate is similar to the smalls columns
(N$10,00 per colV/cm) then we are look-
ing at a total of N$5000,00.

Dr Iyambo has my commiseration in
the loss that he has suffered. It is unfortu-
nate that his add was so prominent as to
draw my attenton. I know that the van-

ous ministries continuously place what

ices with public
money. I am only astounded at the level
of acceptance that has been reached by

the citizens of our country when the
abuse of public funds in this manner
draws no comment.
