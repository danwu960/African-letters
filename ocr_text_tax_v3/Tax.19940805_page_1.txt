Call For ‘Clear, Objective’
Reporting From Dr Tjingaete

I FOUND your editonal
comment ‘A call for
more productivity’ in
which the report of the
Auditor-General for the
financial year ending
March 31 1993 to be
most illuminating.

There are a number of
points which [ believe
deserve further com-
ment.

Firstly, a person who
should be ‘independent
and objective’ should use
such expressions which
reflect his or her objec-
tivity.

The Auditor-General
has created for himself a
problem of expression
for future reports.

The use of expressions
as ‘culprits’, ‘fraud is
rampant’, ‘outstanding S
& T E allowances have
reached alarming pro-
portions’, ‘chaotic fash-

ion’ as these terms are
all relative to one of de-

gree and substance.

For instance, the ex-
pression ‘rampant’ is
used denoting that a situ-
ation has arisen where
the incidence of fraud
has reached uncontrol-
lable (mass or mob) pro-
portions and the perpe-
trators thereof are doing
it in an aggressive and
defiant manner.

The Ministry of For-
eign Affairs is one of
those singled out where
fraud is rampant.

Now when one checks
the AG’s own comment

under ‘Auditor opinion’
on page 86 of the report,
reference is only made
to one incident of theft,
in| which Zambia
Kwacha were stolen and
on page 96 under
subparagraph 3.7.7.2.
*Fraud/thefUmisuse of
government property
and manpower’ the Au-
ditor-General himscif
reports: “Nothing in this
regard was reported to
me by the accounting
officer nor were any de-
tected dunng the venfi-
cation of annual report
information.”

Come on Dr Thingaete,

be fair, does this add up
to ‘rampant fraud’ or are
you guilty of using your
independent office to at-
tack the Minister of For-
cign Affairs because he
dared to criticise you?
This surely seems to
be the case as you very
disappointingly on page
3 question the right/
privilege of certainmem-
bers of the National As-
sembly to do what they
are appornted to do and
that 1s to question the
acts, attitudes and com-
ments of any person
which they regard appro-
priate to raise in parlia-

ment.

Your sensitivity to this
Situation suggests you
are not able to take criti-
cism (which you must
accept as part of the
democratic process) but
you feel free to criticise
others in a subjective
fashion, whereas your
high office calls for a
clear head and objective
teporting.

Finally, I find the par-
allel of your comments
and those of the DTA
most amusing. (Is there
a mutual ‘hot line’ and if
so, who is paying for it -
the taxpayers?)

Greetings, and we are
looking forward to next
year’s report and the
‘rampant flow of exces-
sive expressions’.
