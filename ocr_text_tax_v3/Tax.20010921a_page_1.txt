What’s Going On At NBC?

AS a viewer, I think that
NBC under the leadership
of Dr Ben Mulongeni and
his staff has definitely
changed for the better. So 1
am surprised as to what the
confusion as reported by
NBC news and The
Namibian on September 12
is all about.

Again, there was
Kaumbi on TV saying that
they just had a great work-
shop of the NBC staff: that
there are no divisions
among the corporation's
staff, no problem, every-
thing at NBC is great, yet
Mulongeni. might be fired!

What might be confus-
ing is Kaumbt himself and
the people behind him who
have been trying to con-
fuse the public in order to

promote themselves.

I (and maybe others) al-
ways wondered where
Kaumbi, as chairman of the
NBC Board, works and in
what position? I found out
that he works for the
Windhoek Municipality as
an engineer. So, since I see
him on NBC about every
other day (apparently he
evenhas anoffice at NBC),
what are the Municipality
or to put it more exactly,
the Windhoek taxpayers,
paying him for? How could
the municipality/tax payers
spend money on him when
he does not work? Or are
they paying him to run the
day-to-day administration
of the NBC, and in the way
interfering with tts
progress?

With this in mind how
can he possibly be trusted
to judge the extentto which
members of NBC staff are
performing in their jobs?
And to add insult to injury,
he ts not even a journalist.
This is what has been kill-
ing our parastatals.

Lastly, we all know
Mocks Shivute and what a
great job he did for Nampa
or the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Information and
Broadcasting (where he is
telling the whole world that
he does not want to be
there). Ask anv of the work-
ers who served under him.
He has not made tt a secret
that he wants, and always
wanted, to be the NBC di-
rector-general.

If Shivute becomes the

new NBC DG, I am sure
that most of its staff will
leave. | am sure that they
are very afraid of that prob-
ability. Could it be that what
these power hungry fellows
are working on behind
closed doors ts for Shivute
to become the new DG and
Kaumbi the new PS of
MFAIB.

I think no matter what
Mulongent’s weakness(es)
is (are), he just like every-
one cise, needs time to
improve or correct them
and mostimportantly, NBC
needs the money to help
him or anyone else for that
matter, to steer it further
forwards.
