Satellite dishes
and human rights

THE decision to allow Ministers and deputy Min-
isters to buy satellite dishes from their furniture
allowance (The Namibian, January 24) highlights
inconsistencies in government information policy.

In this casc, information is, quite rightly, being
considered a priority and the state is therefore
subsidising the purchase of satellite dishes, pre-
‘sumably so that Ministers and their deputics can
kecp in touch with world events. And yet the
government continucs to tax books and newspa-
pers, which are the main source of information for
many people in this country, particularly those
whocannotafford satellite dishes. To putitcrudcly,
the tax many thousands of people have to pay
when buying reading material - books, newspa-
pers and magazines. which are so important in a
country grappling with widespread illiteracy - ts
being used to buy satellite dishes for a handful of
politicians.

The freedom to seek. receive and impart infor-
mation isa UNIVERSAL human right, and not a
privilege. Media freedom certainly is not just
about ministers getting satellite dishes free of
charge, courtesy of the taxpayer. I would have
thoughta government which professes to have the
welfare of the majority at heart, and which also
claims to promote the free flow of information,
should be aware of this.
