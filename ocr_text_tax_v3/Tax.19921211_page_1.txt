Detainees respond

THE New Era of November
12-18 published a letter from a
certain Shoye Sheya (Oshakatt)
under the heading ‘Detainees
debate irks reader’.
The letter is characterised
‘by outdated rhetoric and not
only aims at disgracing the status
of the former Swapo detainees
but to stir hatred and blood-
shed among Namibians. It is
incomprehensible how a news-
paper wholly funded by the
, taxpayer can descend that low
and spread such sick views.
Mr Sheya and New Era wnites,
| | among others, that ‘the former
South African agents must bear
in mind that it was not Swapo

. | which sent them to spy in the
_ | organisation’. The letter fur-

ther portrays the Swapo de-
tainees as having been respon-
sible for the deaths of many
Namibians through ‘treacher-
ous ways’.

It must have been during
such a time that Jesus C'unst
shook his head and said ‘Lord,
forgive them, for they don't
know what they are doing..’ It
is a sad case. Yet, we shall

r | forgive the naive ‘revolution-
. | ary’ Shoye Sheya. But the
; | Shoyas and the New Eras should
be taught to understand our

r | bitterness.
