Not Enough Constructive Engagement

IN Namibia too much
time and energy is ex-
pended on unproductive
activities and too much
resources wasted for
us to make meaningful
progress in achieving
development goals and
to be aserious contender
for achieving higher
rankings in internation-
al wellness ratings.

A large part, if not
the majority of devel-
opmental activities in
Namibia, are brought

about by international
funding and develop-
ment organisations,
while we often keep
ourselves busy with
petty and destructive
issues.

We afford ourselves
the luxury of misman-
aging public funds and
Organisations, com-
pounding of bureau-
cratic procedures, poor
service to the public
al many government
offices, hate speech,

undermining of Na-
mibians that do make
positive contributions,
keeping of deserved
candidates from the
Olympic squad, etc.
The list is much long-
er, but I suffice with
these examples.
Fortunately there are
also many people from
all racial groupings
in Namibia who work
hard at building a just
society, bringing about
economic growth, pay-

ing their taxes, conserv-
ing the environmentand
generally carrying the
weight of keeping the
socio-economic sys-
tems going.

These people are of-
ten not seen and heard,
but they are there and
they are the real heroes
of society.

This letter is a tribute
to them.
