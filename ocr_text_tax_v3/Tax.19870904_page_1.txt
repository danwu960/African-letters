Rolé of nurses

1 AM not writing on behalf of black
nurses only buton behalf of all nurses,

-drrespective of colour, because the nur-
_ sing profession knows no colour.

‘Disgusted’ of Katutura recently
wrote about one incident concerning

the profession, but not aloft. Let me

tell all Namibian taxpayers what they
pay for. The pay raise which has been
announced isnot s-lvingthe problem,
but is part of it.

Recently a groupof women from the
different communities came together
to consult with the nursing heads,
thinking that,thay could help to.iden;
tify the problems and at the same time
solve them, which was a good and
sound gesture, But instead of trying to
improve the situation, the nursing
heads felt that they stood
unreasonably accused, and wanted
names and dates when the incidents
happened.

Isay that ‘silence never wonrights’.
There are those of us who sat at that —
meeting and took note of what was —
said. But how are we to improve condi-
tions when there were posts advertis-
ed almost a year ago and so far we have
heard nothingabout them. Instead in
the latest hospital news brief, we read
of someone who is being moved from
one high post to another. Nothing
advertised. Where does the post sud-
denly come from? The joke is that the
person who has been appointed has to
be taught by the old staff. The post she
has left has to wait for another
‘favourite friend’ in order to be filled?

If the senior structure is not right,
then what motivation is there for the
rest of the personnel to be faithful?
What are all the sisters doing in the of-
fice - why must they all be doing
statistics and filing? Why can’tclerks
be employed, and let the nurses do nur-
sing tasks.

The nursing care on the wards is not
up to scratch. So Mra Barlow, take a
hint and do something to improve the
situation. Do you need all those nurses
around your office?

There ia another incident about
which all nurses are aware: sometime
last year a senior retired nurse was ad-
mitted to hospital for a major opera-
tion, and two days after the operation
she was still lying there in her theatre
gown, not in the beat of health. How
does that sound? Jt is not only the per-
son in the street who suffers, but ‘old
nurses’ too.

Please do something about this —
situation. Reduce the number . of

nurses around you, Mrs Barlow, you

don’t need them all for moral support.
