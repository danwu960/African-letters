| TAKE this opportunity to praise Nahas Angula and Ya Kasita for
their insight into the financial Strain that the current educational
system puts on parents. The Namibian of May || reported on the
Suggestions made by the two gentlemen in their respective rows
with regard to tax rebates and exemption to parents who pay fe rene!
children’s studies at the University of Namibia and other institutions
of higher Icarning.

These goverment officials’ proposal is a testimony that they
mcopnise the role played by Namibian Parents in financing their
children’s education. These parents have a great need for a tax relief
by the government. What they do is obviously to the benefit of the
entire nation.

Furthermore, recognition of the burden that tuition fees place on
many parents clearly shows that Angula and Ya Kasita idenufy with
the masses.

I patiently wait for these humane proposals to become a reality.
