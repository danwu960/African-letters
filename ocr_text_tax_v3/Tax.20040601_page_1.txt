LCA Thanks Supporters

THE local authority election of 2004
is history. Unfortunately the LCA
was not able to reach its anticipated
results. Only 34,98 % of the regis-
tered voters in Windhoek participated
in the election. This shameful show
of non-interest once again granted
the existing authority the unlimited
majority.

We from the Local Community
Association want to thank all our can-
didates, voters and helpers, especially
Jurie Viljoen, for their assistance and
hard work.

A special word of thanks also to
those private individuals who enabled
us to run our election campaign with
their financial assistance. The money
was used for advertisements, printing
costs, copies etc

Even if we did not reach our goal
and are no longer represented Tn
local authority, we together with the
Windhock Ratepayers Association
(WRA) will keep a watchful eye on
their activities and fiscal policy. We

will comment upon the decisions
taken by this authority and should
any decisions taken not be in the
interest of the Windhoek citizens,
we will make this known through
the local media.

It is the money of the taxpayers in
Windhoek that is involved in these
decisions and therefore the citizens
have the right and the responsibility
to be watchful and critical. Help us
to keep a watchful eye by informing
us about any irregularities that you
notice.

In conclusion: Thank you again for
your support. We will see you again
in 5 years time, then hopefully with
more success due to a better voter
participation. And remember, if you
have not voted, you by implication
stated that you are happy with the
current state of affairs as you did not
want to try and change things.
