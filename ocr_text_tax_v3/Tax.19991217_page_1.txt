Walvis Youth Vow
To Tackle Crime

IT 1S Christmas and crime is increasing every where
in Namibia. The coast is the target of therogbers and
those attacking other people. ae

The reason is, there is only one Police vehicle to
assist about 5 000 people of Walvis Bay. The rest
have been damaged and in accidents. The Govern-
ment vehicles which have been in the country for
barely three years have been destroyed. Officials .—
are destroying what is purchased with our our tax
money, the violence 1s increasing and we are with-
out transport.

A week ago tour men attacked an elderly person
in Walvis Bay. Three days after that a certain
businessman in Kuisebmond was assaulted in his
house. The worst of all is that the Police renders bad
service.

The youth will not allow the elderly, businesses
and other people to be attacked in the streets for
nothing. We, the youth, will take the law inourown
hands and we will hit back hard.

Weare directing a friendly request to the Govern-
ment, Police Commissioner and the Mayor, Mrs
Samaria, in Walvis Bay: stop the violence in Walvis
Bay, we are not afraid of fighting back, we are just
brought up well.

Every weekend someone is assaulted. We think
the Police station commander at Kuisebmond should
do something about that.

The only people who stop crime at Walvis Bay
are “Community against Crime’. Magnificent, guys.
we are proud of you. Mrs Samana, bring more
vehicles and English-speaking Police to the police
stations so that we can just understand each other.

Unhappy Youth
