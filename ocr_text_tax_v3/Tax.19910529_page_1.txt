“Budget praise

‘ ALLOW me to express my
sincere thanks and apprecia-
tion for the outstanding and
well prepared budget for the
year 1991/2.

As a citizen of this country
and a person who has read and
listened to vanous budget
speeches of many countries
throughout the world, I can
assure the Honourable Minis-
ter that his budget speech was
well-articulated and fascinat-

ing. Congratulations for that.
| Having said that, I would
like to draw your attention to
the public's concer over the
general sales tax (GST).

The educational background
of this country reveals that the
majority of citizens are illiter-
ate or ignorant in one way or
another, especially when it
comes to mathematics.

It would therefore be help-
ful to us if the Minister could
use his authority to request the
business community to include
GST in the general price of
items found in the shops.

The reason being that not all
of us know how to calculate

money for tax. We are not
demanding the abolition of GST
but want it to be included in the

* gencral sales price.

The other point is that the
public's general feeling is that
there is a Jack of general infor-
mation as to the purpose of
GST, and how it works.

Ihope that the Minister will
be able to facilitate the inclu-
sion of GST in the general
sales price of goods.

Paying for toilets

T WOULD be grateful for the
opportunity through your col-
unuis to air my concer. lama
teacher at Opuwo Secondary
School in Kaoko district. lam
really concemed about the
system of paying for the use of
toiletsimposed by many of the
service station owners, particu-
larly in Outjo.

When you ask why you have
to pay for the toilet, you are
told that you are not a cus-
tomer. So I wonder how they
know who their customers are
and who are not. ‘
