leaders and top politicians seam
to spond a great deal of time in
‘the National Assembly discuss-
ing the detaiis of bills which
seem of little importance to
| the Namibian people.
: Once again this seems to be
& tactic to prevent our elected
leaders from concentrating their
time and energy on the issues
of imortance to the people.
You need only look at Nica-
| ragua to sce how democracy
_ can be used to remove a popu-
~ tarly elected government.
| The technique is to prevent
| the Government from carrying
out its major election prom-
ises.

This is the process that is
currently taking place in
Namibia and the target is obvi-
ously to create a cnsis of con-
fidence that will produce a poor
result for Swapo in the regional
elections.

I appeal to our leaders not to
be fooled by bureaucratic de-
lays, but to push forward swiftly
with the policies that secured
them their election victory.

‘Special’
branch?

IN THE Namibian police we
have what is called a “special
branch’. Though I know the
meaning of the words ‘ spe-
cial’ and ‘branch’, I fail to
understand what type of job
they are entrusted to fulfil by
the Government.

I would like to ask both
Miniser Hifekepunye Pohamba

a rer

Sowa te Jowett epoca

The ‘special branch’ as I cams
lo know it, has a history which
is wellknown in this country.
It is known because of its noto-
riety, something like that of
Koevoet. Yet today the ‘spe-
cial branch’ continues to exist
and is the more privileged
section of the Namibian po-
lice.

Formerly they used to inter-
rogate captured guerrillas, spy
on Swapo and quell Swapo

- mectings. What is their task

now? To quell what? To pro-
tect the state? Have they changed

colours?

All you see now is these
people driving their Ford Sier-
ras and Landcruisers in the
streets of Windhoek and other
towns.

It seems that they are not
affected by the recent circular
of Deputy Inspector General
Andima which prohibits any
police car to be used for pn-
vate purposes.

I, as a member of the Na-
mibian police, and a taxpayer,
am not satisfied with the fac.
that this ‘special branch’ still
exists.

If its continued existence
camies the approval of the
authorities, then its perform-
ances must be reviewed and
amended os terminated if their
job has ended.

The hard-working uniformed
members of the police walk
many kms in distance to work
and home, while those elite
policemen pass them by in their
Landcruisers.

What are they doing that is
#0 important that they are even

allowed to park their cars at
home?
