I want to wam these foreigners
who want to stay in our country to
behave accordingly. They should
respect our laws; stop interfering in
our politics and bear with us: we have

Home Affairs to tighten our border
controls to prevent people who do
not want to respect our laws from
coming here.

It is also important to review work

to invest; and fortune seekers and
other refugees should be repatriated
to their own countnies.

We fought for this country and no
one should insult us or tell us how to
conduct our affairs. Mrs Cox must be
shown the way and go and do what
she wants in her own country.
