Questions About Tax Workshop For MPs

IT’S a shock to read that a workshop is being
organised to help parliamentarians to under-
stand the tax return forms.

First of all it appears that this is being done
with Government monies. Secondly parlia-
mentarians get paid loads of money and can
certainly afford the services of tax consultants
in their own private capacity. They will argue
that the more business and private ventures
one has the more complicated the form gets,
but they should have thought about this before
entering into these ventures and this is there-
fore no a valid excuse.

The service that they require is by no means
a public good and is therefore not in the pub-

lic’s interest for Government to fund such a
workshop. If the parliamentarians have prob-
lems understanding the forms and paying tax
consultants to do their returns, how on earth
does the Government expect the ordinary per-
son on the street to fill in the tax return forms?
It would be in public interest to hold nation-
wide workshops for everybody including the
wealthy but stingy parliamentarians on how to
fill in tax return forms. And to bring up this
issue five days before the deadline is preposter-
ous and makes one question our leadership!
