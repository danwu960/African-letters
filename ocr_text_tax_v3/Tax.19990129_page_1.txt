Opening Up
The Skies

THE application for a licence by Quickjet Pty
Ltd serving before the Namibian Transport
Commission (NTC) presents an interesting op-
portunity to test the new legislation passed at
the end of last year amending the Air Services
Act of 1948,

The new legislation specifically removes any
protection against competition for Air Namibia
and TransNamib,

The applicant viz Quickjet is a company
funded with private money and in no way relies
on government for financial assistance. It ts
backed by Namibian Harvest Investments, a
public company whose aim it is to empower
Namibians. It is unlikely that any other appll-
cation involving a similar amount of money
(N$10 million) will come before the NTC again
in the near future.

While it is known that there is another airline
viz Kalahari Express that is also supposed to
serve the Eros-South Africa routes, this airline
has after some two years not been able to start
operations and it in any case now resorts under
Air Namibia, a company making heavy losses

“qa becoming an increasingly heavy burden on
the taxpayers. If Kalahari Express is to be run
mA Air’ Namibia with the same degree of
and unreliability as its own serv-
hoes then it is certainly in the public interest that
y funded airline be given an opportu-
