Colleagues and I noticed
that the head of the ceaure
acts as though the place is
sull a prison.
| Furthermore, since the

place is a youth centre,
besides the name change, |
would further like to add to
| the recommendations, that

a library be placed in the

youth centre which should
| have information on the May

4 massacre and its Signifi-
cance to the struggle for

om

Also the guard towers
around the camp must be
removed and the place,
especially if children are to
be in it, thoroughly searched
for ammunition of all types
because the finding of such
ammunition was reported to
me during my stay there.

So to Achilles Angula,
Willy Amutenya, Simon
Mertin, Sackie Nuyoma,
Matheus Shaanika, Paul
Ipumbu, Benjamin Ausiku,
Ambrosius Shivute, Thomas
Ashinkono and to the many
others and the brothers, sis-
ters, mothers and fathers of
ube deceased, we will never
forget your suffering, your
pain, your hurt and your
losses. You are our heroes.

No to botsotsos

THROUGH the medium of
your newspaper please al-
low me to address the mat-
ter of those many faceless
individuals who are so suc-
cessfully destroying the
imegrity of our city and
undermining the security of
our nation by their tax-free
enterprises at the expense
of other, hardworking
Namibian men and women.

I refer to the botsotsos
who believe that everyone

else’s possessions belong to
_{ and are just placed

take. .

Holy Week Programme and
had arrived bringing with
him his wife and three other
people from his Diocese.
At 10h15 on the Tuesday
following their arrival, a
gang of three young men
were interrupted when they
broke through the rear win-
dow of the Bishop's car.

They turned on the per-
son who shouted at them to
Stop and threatened him with
death “when they found him
in Katutura”! That was bad
enough.

On Easter Day, between

lunchtime and 18h30,
taking the Bishop’s trailer
from the car park where it
had been secured by chain
and lock to a fence post.
. AS our visitors were sched-
uled to leave at 07h00 the
next moming this latest
episode caused quite a dis-
Tuption.

We then had to arrange
for them to borrow another
trailer to take their luggage
home in.

One lot of visitors - ‘hit’
twice in one week - very
sad! If only it were an iso-
lated incident. Unfortunately
we all know it is not s0,
because many of us have
had to contend with cases
of a similar nature ourselves.

In this area, the botsotsos
regularly thieve from cars
parked outside our church
dunng worship services on
Sundays.

I am not advocating any
form of vigilante action here
but I do wish to appeal to
John and Jane Citizen not to
buy the goods these gang
members offer for sale to
them.

If there is no ready and
willing market, it would not
be worth the botsotsos time
and energy to steal, or cer-
tainly they would not have
to steal so much - one TV
and VCR should be enough!

In the long run we are all
having to pay much, much
more for the botsotsos ex-
travagant lifestyles than we
of crime are making a dis-
cernible dent in our national
economy apart from ad-
versely affecting the climate
for attracting many poten-
tial investment opportuni-
ties.
