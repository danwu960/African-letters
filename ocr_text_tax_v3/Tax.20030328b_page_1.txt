On Acquired Expatriate |
Dependency Syndrome

THE letter of M Makumbi

that appeared in your es-

teemed newspaper of March
18th, 2003 should not go
without comment,

I am an expatriate who
has been in this country for
the past three years, and
sometimes I get very frus-
trated at the country’s fail-
ure Co invest in human capi-
talin fields that matter most.
This has been the Cause of
the so-called Acquired Ex-
Patriate Dependency Syn-
drome (AEDS), described by
Makumbi. There seems to
be a total ignorance even of
what kind of scientists, tech-
nologists and engineers this
Country needs. As a result,
more money is being in-
vested in the training of spe-
Cialists who end up roaming
the streets looking for jobs,
instead of focusing on train-
ing job creators.

One fact though, is that
Namibians themselves are
not committed to Serving in
low Paying Professions,

» fequire many

years of training and hard
work. The University of Na-
mibia,can for example, hardly
retain a Namiblan with a post-
graduate qualification in eco-
nomics, engineering or IT.
They leave the University for
better paying jobs outside the
University, in the Govern-
mentand private sector. Simi-
larly, most Namibian medical
Practitioners find that private
Practice is better paying than
working in aGovernment hos-
pital.

That is why Namibia must
be very thankful for countries
like Cuba which continue to
send their doctors to work
here, and for those other ex-
Patriates, who leave their
countries to work here. As a
matter of fact, Namibia is not
the most attractive place for
expatriates to work. Salaries
are generally low, taxation is
very high, and even despite
Paying all taxes, expatriates
have no easy access to state
benefits such as basic educa-
tion and medical care. Nota-
bly, many of them are leaving

Namibia for their home coun-
tries or to greener pastures
elsewhere,

My suggestion is that Na-
mibia should invest heavily in
higher education in relevant
fields such as medicine and
engineering.

The present level of Science
and Technology programmes
at the University and the Poly-
technic should be elevated and
cach institution should focus
on its state-given mandate,
and develop human capital in
areas relevant to the coun-
try’s development strategy at
their mandated levels.

After thirteen years of inde-
pendence, Namibia does not
have a medical faculty nor an
engineering faculty at its uni-
versity.

For three years I have been
at Unam, I have seen zero
investment from Government
in the engineering training.
Even the Polytechnic, with its
recently established engineer-
ing school, lacks essential in-
frastructure and human re-
sources to produce competent

technicians, Iet alone tech.
nologists. Now they want to
become a university! There
is unnecessary and unwar.
tanted competition

Unam and Polytechnic
which must be stopped at aq]
costs.

I wish the Namibian peo.
ple success in this more dif.
ficult phase of socio-ecg.
nomic liberation. The pre.
scription for AEDS is invesg.
ment in science and techno}.

,and empowering higher
institutions to hire the begy
brains from anywhere in the
world, so that More
Namibians can be trained
locally.

That its what even hi
developed countries like the
USA are doing. Replacing
expatriates with ill-trained,
inexperienced Namibiang
for the sake of patriotism, is
killing this nation directly,
By failing to prepare, you
will prepare to fail.
