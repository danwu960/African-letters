‘What A Swakop Disgrace’

SWAKOPMUND 5s one of the old-
ext towns and one of the biggest tour-
ist attractions in Nambia. However,
@s Soon as i( Starts to rain, even only
a few drops, the streets of this town
(urn into instant salt pans. The mud
has to be sprayed off the cars as soon
8s possible, otherwise the car disup-
pears from underneath you as the
rust cats its way through. It is for-
bidden to clean the mud off your car
in the streets and nobody knows
what to do with the salt drenched
&ypsum on their erven which fn fact
belongs to the Municipality. To
steam clean your car in Windhoek
costs N$70.
Only a2 small portion of
Swakopmund has tarred or inter-
locked streets. I, as a rate and tax-
paycr of the town, would like to
know when and whether the council
will replace this mess with properly

tarred roads. Every small town in Na-
mibla, whether it ts: Otavi or Outjo,
has more kilometres of tarred road
than Swakopmund and I am sure
their rates and taxes are not as high
as ours.

Since the Prime Minister now owns
&@ property in the new extension, no
one would be surprised if the council
dccides that the rvad leading to his
mansion should be tarred/inter-
locked. Thankfully then a few pco-
ple will be able to share a decent ruad,

If the town of Swakopmund looks
like a pigsty, what about Mondesa
and Tamariskia? Why is it that
Walvis Bay has tarred roads and
Swakop not?

Hopefully the town council will re-
ply through the press on what their
intentions are.
