water which is our own natural re-
source? We want the water at Een-
hana to be controlled by the Depart-
ment of Water Affairs rather than
the SADF.

Residents in particular suffer
daily sat the hands of the socalled
protectors whenever they approach
them for water. Sometimes pe ple
are sent home with empty buckets.
One wonders how people manage to
prepare food and what they drink
under the circumstances.

Seemingly only the civiliana are
refused water but it is freely given to
Koevoet and the SADF members.
You see people queueing for water
here.

In conclusion, I would like to re-
quest the SADF to vacate the water
reservoir at Eenhana and allow it to
be taken over by the Department of
Water Affairs.

‘Security’
meetings

PLEASE allow me a space in the
people’s newspaper to highlight
to both The Namibian and the
Namibian people at large, the
discriminatory practices applied
here in the  Caprivi
Administration.

I was shocked by the wrongful

i ; 1AM,

apparently aimed at the furtherance
of National Party policies, on a
mouthly basis. No black man attends
theese meetings.

Presently the situation in Caprivi
allows for taxation of Caprivians and
not whites as the latter claim that
Act 2 of 1974 is applicable to Caprivi-
ans only. The SA Government has
done nothing to repeal this legisla-
tion.

Caprivian officials pay one per
cent of their income (monthly), in
addition to the general tax payable to
the Receiver of Revenue. A surpris-
ing fact is that there areno income
tax returns handed to taxj;ayers as is
habitual with the Receiver of Reve-
nue. It is disturbing too, to find that
the following people do not pay this
(one percent) tax: all Caprivians
employed by other government de-
partments and/or private institu-
tions; all whites and non-Caprivians
employed by the Administration; all
tribal indunas; general dealers and
traders in the area.

I wish to call on progressive Ca-
privi Administration officials to re-
ject this uncalled-for tax. This act of
the colonisers should be viewed seri-
ously and the nominated Executive
Committee abolished with immedi-
ate effect. It has failed to satisfy the
wishes of the people aa it is only
dancing to the tune of its masters
(the whites). How can they allow
Caprivians to be milked by these
people?

This legislation should be tested in
a court of law.

In addition the whites in the area
are presently trying to separate
Caprivi from the rest of progressive
Namibia. The suffering of Caprivi ie
largely due to the fact that the area is
used as a dumping ground for whites
who have failed to make the grade
elsewhere.

Laatly I want to call on the Intell}
gentaia in the region to mobiles
people for independence. No other
region in Namibia has a ‘white godfs-
ther’ like in Caprivi. Come, one and
all, let ue stand tagether and fight
the colonialiets.
