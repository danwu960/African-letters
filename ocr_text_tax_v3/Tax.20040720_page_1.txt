Civil Servant Requests To Retire At 50

I WOULD like to air
my views through your
newspaper to the Prime
Minister as the head
of the civil service.
Due to the prevalence
of HIV/AIDS and the
high rate of deaths in
Namibia, I would like
to ask our dear Prime
Minister to reduce the
retirement age of civil
servants from 55 years
to 50 years.

For example I am 53
years old and forced by
law to hang on until Iâ€™m
55, while I have already
served 35 years and am
spiritually and physi-
cally burnt out. The
doctors said I must hang
on because they cannot
write me off. Please

dear Prime Minister go
into this matter and give
us a democratic choice,
those who are strong
and productive can go
on even until 60.

Those who have start-
ed working at a young
age can be givenachoice
to retire earlier, at least
at 50 years. I also think
that the release of older
people earlier can give
a chance to young edu-
cated people to enter the
civil service.

Only about 10% older
people over 50-60 years
are productive, the other
50% are going to work
because they are forced
by law to reacha re-
quired age.

Finally dear Prime

Minister, there are agents
going around telling old
people to retire and to
transfer their pension
monies to private insur-
ance companies.

The problem hereisthe
very high tax if one with-
draws money from the
fund. About 35% is
deducted. Please let this
practise be stopped. The
GIPF must deal directly
with the pensioner who
wants to retire. A tax
deduction of 20% can
be considered because
we want to get a decent
pension to go into farm-
ing orto start a new
business. I hope this
voice of an ordinary
civil servantcan also be
heard. The government

of today only listens to
the voices of the highly
educated people, there-
fore many documented
ideas and programmes
cannot be implemented
because the people on
the ground are ignored.

Our government must
seriously look into the
current laws regulating
the government pension
fund.

For example a la-
bourer working for 40
years is getting N$30
000 (lump sum) and
monthly N$ 500.00.
What is this? The Prime
Minister, Public Service
Commission, Napwu,
Nantu, Parliamentarians
must look into this mat-
ter. The politicians were

very clever because they
de-link and establish
theirown pension funds.
Avery good idea. Please
also think about us.

In conclusion, I urge
my dear Prime Minister
to do at least one good
thing for the public
servants because we do
not know what will hap-
pen after March 2005.
We pray for the new
President Pohamba to
keep the current Prime
Minister for the next 5
years in the past so that
the public service can
be cleaned. I salute you
Prime Minister Theo-
Ben Gurirab.
