Problems Of Distance Education

1 WOULD like to re-
spond to the letter by A
lnthana tn The Namibian
of July 7 concerning the
Centre for External
Studies, Unam. Apart
from some detail, such
as the allegation about
master copies of study
material for the Diploma
in Education (Afncan
Studies) being lost, the
essence of the com-
plaints about the service
provided to students at
the CES is unfortunately
accurate.
Distance education is
a highly specialised
form of education that is
growing incredsbly fast
wortdwide, its value ly-
ing im the fact that «
makes quality education
for people who other-
wise have no access to
schools, colleges or uni-
versities a practical pos-
sibility.

Distance education
also makes it possible
for adult learners to 1n-
crease their skill‘know!-
edge in thetr field with-
out having to leave their
families and jobs.

At Unam distance
education has been
stated to be the means
by which the majority
of disadvantaged
Namibians, who in co-
lonial times were
marginalised from a
functional and fair edu-

cation, can be reached.
And in fact the steadily
increasing enrolment al
CES show that the need
for distance education in
Namibia is great.

This is particularly the
case for teacher training
Courses.

The problem is that in
Namibia distance edu-
cation has been largely
based on the South Afri-

can tradition of whtch
Unisa is the biggest cx-
ample. The approach 1s
known for its emphasis
on efficient administra-
tion rather than student
support and rather low
quality of study materi-
als which to a large cx-
tent encourages rote
learning and includes
virtually only print as a
medium. While this ap-
proach, known as corre-
spondence tuition, has
played an important role,
the development of dis-
tance education since the
sixties has proven it to
be conservative and out-

dated.

In Namibia, in particu-
lar at CES, the Unisa
tradition still prevails in
the structure of the or-
ganisation. Because the
inhented structure dacs
not allow for cfficient
functioning of the two
basic aspects of distance
education, namely
course matenal devel-
opment and student sup-
port, CES struggles with
providing the kind of
distance education stu-
dents need and are enti-
tled to.

Within this system,
CES staff have done

their utmost to solve cn-
ses as they arise and to
keep student services
going. The problems
pointed out by lithana
are therefore not new to
staff. Especially recently
there has been a grow-
ing awareness about and
frustration with these
problems.

As aCES staff mem-
ber for the last six years,
I fecl CES must radi-
cally transform the en-
lire approach to distance
education. This would
include changing the
structure in terms of
study material develop-

Ment and production (in-
cluding more media
such as radio and audio
cassettes), student sup-
port (developing tc-
gional centres into aca-
demic support centres
rather than admuinistra-
tive centres only); man-
agement and administra-
tion and research and

While some changes
have occurred since the
University takeover in
1991, such as the name,
a complete transforma-
tion of structures within
CES is essential.

Inspite of difficult cir-

cumstances and limited
resources, CES man-
aged to train many stu-
dents who indeed would
not have otherwise had

the opportunity for
higher education.

More significantly,
our students are people
of immense determina-
tion and courage, who
hot only have to cope
with problems as out-
lined by lithana, but also
have to deal with full-

time work and family

commitments. They are
