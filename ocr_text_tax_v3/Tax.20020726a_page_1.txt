A NORMAL cconomy
works ke a take away
The customer pays and
takes away something to
eat or to drink The shop
itself belongs to an owner
who employs a manager
and the rest of the staff
They are responsible for
the running of the outfit If
they do not perform, they
have to leave. They are
controlled daily. [f the shop
does not eam money for

A factory does not func:
uon differently.

But the Namibian
economy is different. It
should be called Give-
Away. Here the taxpayer
pays the unknown bill in
advance or later, and some
customers of some man-
ager or some employees
runaway with the goods or
the service or the salary
eathout delivering an ad-
equate compensation.

This has been exercised
in many different outfits,
which are created and
sponsored by the govern
meat of the day. Manage-
rial posts are filled with
sometimes unfit, but tested
and loyal party cadres.

The Ramatex complex
has so far consumed sev-
eral hundred million NS
from the taxpayer.

After complaints from

given, who was responsi-
bie for the attack on the
enquiring public. The an-
swers given are very funny
to read but also very con-

tusingand consistof state -
ments which no normal
company would give Onc
wonders why a gorem
ment department, sbich
uses the word ‘we’ when
speaking of Rumatex Na
mubia. or alawyer answers
to such normal complaints
about the conduct of a pn-
vate company. [s Ramatex
Namibia also a parastatal
or party-company? One
wouldexpectapromptand
short reaction from the
Ramatex management
through a press release
from their public relauons
department to avoid such
pompous statements.

Anyhow, the two un-
wanted statements reveal
the following:

1. Ramatex is nota min-
ingcompany, which mines
radioactive mineral

2. Ramatex has not
started the knitung proc-
ess and is not cutting gar-
ments. But they are pack-
ing finished garments.
(Quesuon: Manufactured
by whom and where”)

3. Ramatex has a stwong
code of conduct with an
independent venfication
and public reporting. (Re-
mark: This is certainly up
to now not true for the
Namibian taxpayer)

4. Ramatex has pegged
the workers wages toa
minimum amount, suffi-
cient to meet the basic
peeds of the persconcl.
This is a result of @ con
pany study. The hourly
wage was fixed at NS3. if
the company cannot organ-
ise continuous work, there
is no pay and therefore no
fulfilment of basic needs.
