1999 Election Win)

IT is distressing to observe the way in which gov-
cmmentis behaving. They asked us to vote for them
and thus acquired their two thirds majority with the
promise to make noticeable, qualitative changes.
Unfortunately the power that the clectorate has
given them isemployed in self-enrichment schemes.
I fail to understand the proposal by Cabinet that
the servants of ministers and their deputies are to be
paid by the government. Ministers receive high
monthly salaries and I cannot see any justification
for the proposal that taxpayers’ moncy be used to
pay the salaries of domestic workers.
The constant claim by government that there are
no funds available and subsequently not sufficient
police transport, ambulances for medical services 1s

unfounded if this is the way government funds are
to be allocated.

The University has increased its tuition fees and
the Ministry of Education has refused to increase
the Bursary scheme the main reason being that there
are not sufficient funds. Students are starving since
their meal fecs have been transferred to pay course
fees. Bursary holders are forced to make additional
loans, plummeting them further into financial debt.

Iam appealing to the President and his Cabinet to
give this matter some serious attention. Some dras-
tic changes have to be made if they wish to have a
satisfactory outcome in the 1999 gencral elections.
