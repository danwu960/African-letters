There’s A Need For Class
Action Lawsuits in Namibia

Letters to the
Elite

THANK you for printing
Lucy Quacinella’s opin-
ton piece of homelessness
CCriminalising the Poor’,
24 June 1994). The Urban
Trust, a new non-partisan
NGO service organisa-
tion, supports the writer's
contention that the urban
poor deserve greater ac-
cess to legal due process.
We also fully agree that
the Government’s re-
sources and energies
should be directed into
economic development
and housing programmes
rather than ‘resettling’
squatters. We Namibians
also appreciate her diplo-
matic references to the
spotty wack record of US
cities in dealing with the
homeless.

There may be more to
this issue, however, than
first meets the eye. It is
our understanding - and
we beg to be corrected on
this matter - that if a cer-
tain group of homeless
people were to face an
eviction by the
municpality or the Minis-
try of Regional and Local
Government and Hous-
ing. the group members
would, if each could af-
ford it, have to find legal
representation on an indi-
vidual basis rather than as

a ‘class’ to get an inter-
dict. The notion of bring-
ing a ‘class action’ law-
suit against the munici-
pality or the Goverment.
a relatively common tac-
tic by poverty lawyers in
the US, is unheard of in
Namibia. The Urban
Trust hopes we are wrong
in this analysis, but if there
is any legal or procedural
reason preventing class
acuons in Namibia, we
suongly urge the Minis-
try of Jusdtice, the Legal
Assistance Centre, the

- Law Society and UNAM's

HRDC todraft legislation,
with meaningful public
input, that will allow low
income people or consum-
ers facing social and eco-
nomic discnmination, to
express ther legal nght to
sue the Government as a
group or ‘class’. Without
this ability, it does not re-
ally make much difference
if the Government's evic-
uon is legal or illegal; the
result would be just the
same.

On the other hand,
many of the elected mu-

nicipal and regional coun-
cil officials, the National
Housing Enterprise, the
Housing Directorate and
others, are trying their best
to cope with increasing
urbanisation. However
well-intentioned their ac-
tions, most are often
planned without any pub-
lic input, the results to date
are the ‘criminalising’ of
the poor on a number of
fronts. Ms. Quacinella de-
scribes the first in her art-
cle. A second is that reset-
ued squatters from, say as
an example. the single
quarters, which was a ro-
bust local economy two
years ago, are essentially
forced to buy hard-to-serv-
ice land (some on the pre-
tence that they were get-
ting the land for free) fur-
ther out of town that many
people neither wanted nor
could afford.

Many are now in seri-
ous arrears to the National
Housing Enterprise and
the municipality, face im-
minent eviction while the
Government faces the
curse of land speculators

who wall pnwatise public
subsidies

Rental options. up-
grading in situ. and de-
creased regulation on in-
formal sector business
activities, rather than
home ownership, mught be
more appropriate options
for many of the urban poor.

As to re-directing Gov-
emment resources, why
does the Government con-
unue to make large an-
nual budget transfers to
Transnamib and Swawek,
which have bloated re-
serves and resist affirma-
uve action, while the Na-
tional Housing Enterprise
and Namibia Develop-
ment Corporation, which
have implemented af-
firmative action policies,
receive non and little Gov-
emment funding support
respectively? Why is real
Government expenditure
to municipalities and es-
pecially secondary towns
for servicing land declin-
ing? Why are funds for
surveying, Mapping and
proclamations not increas-
ing in the communal

towns? Why is there no
consistent urban land pric-
ing policy thatencourages
cross-subsidisation from
high income communities
to low income communt-
tics? Why do regions re-
ceive flat rate budget allo-
cations regardless of the
incidence of poverty in
their regions and their abil-
ity to raise funds from
towns in the region? How
can we encourage system-
atic, open and formal pub-
lic review of both private
banking and Goverment
planning practices?

The Government and
the municipalities and
towns are doing the best
they can in the face of se-
vere resource constraints.
With more opportunites
for formal parucipation
and increased civileduca-
on, together NGOs, com-
munity-based organisa-
uons, the private sector
and indirect and direct tax-
payers may be able to as-
sist the Government to
foster more effective. effi-
cient, democratic and de-
velopmental forms of ur-
ban govemance.
