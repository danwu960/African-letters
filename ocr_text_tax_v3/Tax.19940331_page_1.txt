Unhappy
academics

THREE Namibian academ-
ics in the US are unhappy
with the University of Na-
mibia for various reasons.
Together they have written
a long letter with regard to
their grievances which The
Namibian will publish in
three parts. We request
Teaders not to take this as a
precedent, for such lengthy
communications have to be
summanised in the normal
course of events. - Editor.

ON |! February 1994 we
spoke out about the lack of
gemuine effort by Unam's
leadership to recruit qualli-
fied Namibians. We stated
our concer that non-
Namibians have enjoyed
higher prirority in filling
positions at the university -
in faculty and management.

In reference to that letter,
Zac Kazapua, Registrar of
Unam, responded on 18
February. As for his mono-
phonic statement, it failed
to address the issues raised
and we find it to be lacking
essential details and there-
fore totally misleading. We
refute his version of a
‘straight record’. We detail
our individual accounts of
jod searches at Unam then
close with a summary state-
men.

DR JOSEPH DIESCHO
(POLITICAL SCIENCE)

On 2 December 1991 the
Department of Political
Studies at the Academy
made me an offer of a posi-
tion of lecturer. I had ac-
cepted the position and was
ready to retum to Namibia
in the course of 1992. Be-
fore my retum, the then
Vice-Chancellor Desig-
nate, Dr Peter Katjavivi,
asked me to stay on in the
US and start a fundraising
campaign for Unam. | was
told that was as good as
working at the university
itself, and | accepted the
challenge as | myself was
not too comfortable with
the Academy.

At that ume, Kayavivi
himself communicated to
the Department of Potitical
Studies in the second se-
mester of 1992 that [ was
no longer coming because
he. as the new chief execu-
uve officer of Unam, gave
me anew assignment in the
US. My appointment as Di-
rector of the Fund for the
University of Namibia in
New York after the person
Katjavivi first appointed
and under whom I was go-
ing to work, was repected

Letters to the
EAtite

by Friends of Namibia in
New York. Many people in
New York refused to ac-
cept that f, as a black Na-
mibian with two doctorates,
and with specialised know!l-
edge of Namibia's history
of education, was appointed
to work under a person
whose only claim to fame
was that she was an Ameri-
can white woman. This per-
son was Ms Melissa
Bruemmer, a friend of
Katjavivi's who at the time
had just completed her mas-
ters degree at Columbia
University. My appoint-
ment was to be from June
1992 to June 1993 after
which I would be either re-
trained in New York or re-
called to take up teaching at
Unam. To this date, my sal-
ary as per contract has not
been paid. Bruemmer, who
did not even alt one day in
an office to do fundraising
for Unam, was paid US$12
000 simply because Dr
Katjavivi promised her that

I stayed on as director of
the campaign for the whole
year without pay. Upon in-
Quiry intomy future in June
1993, now Vice-Chancel-
tor Katjavivi advised me to
stay with fundraising until
a decision was made in
Otober at a meeting with
the Advisory Board of the
Pand of the University of
Namibia in New York.

On 3 August Dr Hugh
Africa, the Dean of Stud-
ies, wrote to me informing
me that Professor Gerhard
Totemeyer had recom-
mended thas the 1991 Acad-
emy offer be reactivated.
Africa wanted me to indi-
cate whether | was inter-
ested. On 2 November, af-
ter my dismissal from the
Fund. { wrote to Africa in-
dicating my interest and
requesting more informa-
tion, especially because the
offer was made by the old
Academy which was no
fonger in existence and in
the light of the recently
completed faculty evalua-
tion exercise. 1 indicated
that it would be appropn-
ate for me to respond to an
offer made in writing by the
new Unam structure. On 10
November Africa wrote to
me that he was not ina
position to make me an of-
fer and that he knew that a
position of senior lecturer
in the department of politi-
cal and administrative stud-
i¢s would soon be adver-

used. He said in the letter
that he was going to advise
the faculty to send me the
advertisement as £00n as it
was ready. I did not deem it
necessary to send my cur-
ficulum vitae at that time
since Unam was already in
posession of it.

The Registrar’statement
is contrary to what the true
record shows. Before writ-
ing this response, 1 tel-
ephoned both Profs
Gerhard Totemeyer and
Andre du Pisani to find out
what they knew about this
matter. Totemeyer (for-
merly Dean) referred me to
Dv Pisani (Acting Dean of
Faculty of Economics and
Management Sciences)
who told me that the post
was not advertised as yet,
and that he would welcome
my application once they
were ready. According to
Dv Pisani, the post | would
be considered for is only a
contract post, such as those
filled by non-Namibians at
present. It is rather interesi-
ing that Unam’s Registrar
states that [ have tumed
down a post that was nei-
ther offered nor advertised.

The meeting at which my
position with the Fund
would be determined took
place on $ and 6 October
1993. During the meeting
the Advisory Board
requrested Katjavivi to tet
me direct the campaign until
September 1994. Katjavivi
and his team, Africa and
Ms Judy Diets, agreed to
the request. The Advisory
Board raised strong objec-
tion to the fact that I worked
for more than a year with-
out a salary. Dr Katjavivi
promised to take care of
this mattet as soon as possi-
ble. On 14 October 1993.
before Dr Katjavivi and his
team left for Namibia, ata
meeting to plan the direc-
tion of the fundraising cam-
paign, the Board wanted to
know why we were receiv-
ing conflictung information
regarding my salary from
him and from the Bursar,
Mr Sante Majiedt. Katjavivi
was asked to explain why,
in the opinion of the Bur-
sar, | was not entitled tothe
payment in the contract.
Unable to furnish a satis-
factory explanation as to
why a Namibian in his em-
ploy was being treated like
someone without rights,
Katjaviviand Diers walked
outof the meeting angrily.
Al the urging of Africa they

teturned two hours later and
Katjavivi promised the
board he was going to pay
me before 15 December
1993. This promise has yet
to be fulfilled.

On a number of occa:
sions, Katjavivitold me that
Unam would recall me as
soon as my role with
fundraising ended. On 6
October 1993 the Advisory
Board sanctioned a private
meeting between Katjavivi
and myself. This came
about when it was very clear
fo the Board members in
the room that Katjavivi was
treating me inhumanely and
was uncomfortable with me
as the head of a successful
and honest operation in
North America. Ina private
conversation that day,
Katjavivitold me that Unam
had already decided to call
me back sometime in 1994.

In the meatime he said, [
would be interviewed by
the American Council on
Education in Washington
DC. He continued to let me
understand that Unam was
already in contact with a
company that would trans-
pont me back home in the
first three months of 1994.
Africa joined us and reiter-
ated that a would be diffi-
cult to take me away from
the fundraising effort after
a commitment had been
made to the Board to have
me direct the campaign until
the Board had deemed oth-
erwise.

On 14 October Katyavive
recommitted to keeping me
as Director, and paying my
salary before December |5
1993. On 30 October he
sent me a letter dismissing
me as director of the
fundraising campaign. The
Teason given was that there
was no money at Unam to
pay my salary. The Board
obsected in the strongest
terms to Katjavivi's action
in the light of decisions
made scarcely two weeks
before. The Chairman of
the Board wrote a letter to
President Nujoma in his
capacity as Chancellor.
President Nujoma wrote to
the Chairman saying he had
teferred the matter to
Katjavivi. On 13 Decem-
ber, the president of the
African American Institute
(AAD Mrs Vivian Lowery-
Derryck. wrote to Katjavivi
asking whether Unam could
give me a jomt appornt-
ment as an academic at
Unam if an American uni-

versily would pay my sal-
ary. On December $4
Kathavini responded that he
could not appoint me at
Unam.

Katyavivi’s action re-
garding fellow Namrbians
ina foreign country and his
lack of understanding of the
laws that regulase a tax ¢x-
empt organisation such as
the Fund for the University
of Namibia, led the Board
to suspend Unam legal
fundraising status and close
the office. Katavivi told
untruths, about the circum
stances of the closure of
Unam's office inthe US, of
that he fired me. He even
misled the public that
fundraising had been un-
successful when the over
whelming feeling of the
advisory board was that it
was more successful than
other fundraising organisa-
tions etablished in the US
that had the necessary fi-
nancial backing from their
Parent institutions.

Katjavivi and Africa
promised the Board that a
line item for fundraising
would be included in
Unam's budget request to
the government. Two
weeks later, without in
forming of consulting the
board of his efforts,
Katjavivi reneged on his
commitment and commu-
nicated to the chair and the
AAI that he does not want
fundraising in the US to be
led by a Namibian. It seems
tome that Katjavivi and his
team are unable to distin-
guish fact from their own
defence mechanisms de
signed to protect them-
selves, [challenge Katfavivi
to stand by what he says in
Private meetings. There are
documents and minutes to
attest to what $ have said
here and am willing to say
even more.

lt 1s very dangerous for
the life of the institution
when ils leaders have to
resort to less than honest
statements and fabricated
facts in order to protect their
interests and friends. A uni-
versity 1s and should be
about truth, learning and
debate. The university ts
not there (o serve a group of
individuals but the nation.
Now and in the future. The
time has come for the na-
tonto believe inits univer-
sity.
