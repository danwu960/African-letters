Wake Up NFA, For The Good Of Soccer

LET me air my disappointment with regards to the
recent resignation of Mr Dumitmy as a result of what ]
can call poor communication between him and the
NFA executive.

Firstly I was disappointed by the feedback given by
the president of the Namibia Football Association on
the night of June 26, which to me didn't make any
sense.

He was arrogant and rude to the reporter. The NFA
President doesn’t have any national interest at heart.
He thinks he can mess up and disorganise Namibian
soccer with whatever knowledge of law he got to
promote himself but he should know that what he is

doing now is actually killing our soccer.

How far do you think we are going to go if we keep
on finng and hiring new coaches because you don’t
want to belp them the way they sce how should the
oatonal team should be ruled. How much money and
how many years will it cost us to have our team
quahified for Word Cup or even for the African Cup of
Nations.

Why should he side with a player (Nauseb)? I'm not
Saying the punishment Dumitru gave is justifiable but
the NFA was suppose to sbow their professionalism in
this case, not to come on air and say: “I'm saying a

layer must come back in to the team”. ;
P Yes, we know he is valuable to the team but it’s high

time that players started to become responsible, know-
ing that they are using up the taxpayers’ money and
there are also other players with potential who want to
Play for the national team.

Secondly, let me ask some questions on the national
soccer team. Look, we have many national teams here
in Namibia in different codes of sport. How many
umes has our soccer team left the country to play
friendly matches with others either in the SADC,
Africa or overseas? Answer: none. Why? Answer: no
moncy. How are we suppose to get money? Through
sponsorship and fundraising events.

Having looked at all those questions I started to
doubt the competence of the NFA executive. Are they
sleeping or what? When are we going to have our
soccer team touring the world or Africa after 11 years
? You've heard the rugby team was in Argentina, the
cncket team is in Canada, but what is wrong with the
football body?

So please let the NFA answer these questions. We, the
soccer lovers, we lost someone who knew and loved the
game and had the potential to develop our soccer and

even to take us to the World Cup. Dumitru and I
As soccer lovers, we will miss Mr

wish him all the best in his career.
