IN response to the letter

Belongs To Us by CASHOR CHAOS
which appeared in The Namibian:
Dear Cash or Chaos at Unam and all

those who feel the same way.

Who do you think you are? What
have you contributed so far that gives
you the right to “wam the Ministry of

| Higher Education that they are playing
| with fire”?
Let me tell yo

A bursary is there to pay for univer-
sity fees, hostel fees, books, etc, and
definitely not for luxuries! If you want
to have money for luxuries, find

WORK.

Facts Of Life

Bursary Money you going to study?

Bursaries are not paid out in cash
because most students would spend the
money irresponsibly and demand more.

It is the taxpayer that pays bursaries
and when I, as a taxpayer, consider your
attitude I am correct in stating Uhat you
do not deserve to be at Unam. You have

the audacity to say, “Give to Caesar what
belongs to Caesar”.

will not it in the future
your family, your church, your money or
your workplace. Think about that.
