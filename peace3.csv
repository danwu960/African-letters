| WEEP FOR MY COUNTRY,
which has been conquered by
force, and in which oppression and
immorality reigns supreme. The
country in which people have lost
their human dignity, the country
where we are nov treated like
foreigners ...

finds himself a little better off, im-

He who knows all, but my heart is

Our oppressors should know
that Namibians are not brain-
washed and we will never be blind-
folded. Justbecause wesmile and

they think we are gateposts, numb
to the stab of pain.

Just because of the laughter on-

our lips and our eyes lowered in
respect, you think we are like

stones.

This is our fatherland which has
been pillaged by foreign con-
querors who have exploited and
grown rich on the spoils of our
nation.

Itis time to abolish apartheid. Let
our brothers in South Africa enjoy
peace, equality, freedom and
justice.

Let the world know our problems,
and let us share our problems with

consider myself a progressive
and would like to encourage the
progressives in this country to
maintain and tighten the existing
cooperation among us, which
Will lead to political unity.

We have a common identity
and common problems which we
can only solve when we are polit-
leaily united.

Let us stop demanding minor
reforms like open hotels and
bera, and instead strive for total

and national indepen-
dence of the Namibian people.

Let us also distance ourselves
from our various political ideol-

ogies. Wecan pursue these after
Independence.

The South African Govern-
ment has embarked on a strate-
gy of political intolerance and the
suppression of any opposition
from progressives. In order to
counter this, we have to combine
forces so that they give the
government to the people.

Let us unite in order to force
South Africa to relingulsh her
colonial positioninNamibia. Our
compatriots in South Africa have
setusan example, andthe ques-
tion for us Is ‘where is our UOF,
and who are the Boesaks and Tu-
tus of Namibia?’.

The time has come for us to
complete the circle in our strug-
gle against imperialism, tribal-
ism and colonialism.

We must not wait for anyone to
come to our ald. We must not be
demoralised by the MPC who
claim to bring about peace and
national reconcilietion. We have

seen how members of Koevoet
beat up our people in Katutura
and how Mr Dawid Bezuldenhout
called for the continued deten-
tlon of Josef Katota. All these
deeds confirm the intention of
the MPC which is to silence
everyone who disagrees with
them.

My assessment is that the MPC
1s the ‘strong arm’ of South Afri-
ca, used to further its colonial in-
terests in Namibia. The members
of the MPC do not represent the
Namibians but only their coloni-
al masijars.

People of Namibia, let us stand
up and show them we do not
need a further hijacking of our
freedom.

We have many peaceful ways
at our disposal by means of
which we can fight against the
system. Let us rally oursetvesbe-

some questions regarding a letter in
The Namibian of November 7. |
would like to appeal to fellow Capriv-

the enemy.

The colonisers create a situation
where we are divided among our-
selves. To them this is an advantage.
It is the cancer of tribalism that is be-

blinded all Caprivians so that they
have failed to recognise developmen-

Please stop regarding your
brothers as Subia or Mafwe - that is
Promoting colonialism in the
country.

Please stop the false accusations
against Mr Muyongo. Whether you
are Subia or Mafwe, the UDP is for
peace, unity and freedom.

If you remain in Canu you will be
in the opposition party until death
and the majority will set up a
democratic government if needs be.

You also challenged Mr M uyongo
a

to tell the world where Mr Simbwae
is. You know that both were nation-
alists and that Mr Simbwae was here
in 1973. By that time Mr Muyongo
was in Zambia. How can Mr Muyon-
go, who was in Zambia, know the
whereabouts of a man who disap-
peared in Caprivi?

Chief Moraliswani and Mr
Ngambela Kalundu and Mr M Mu-

Ask them.

Don’t blame somebody who
suffered for your freedom. When
you are in a war, you win or you lose,
you live or you die. Mr Muyongoand
his supporters did not come into
Caprivi and recruit schoolchildren at
gunpoint.

Mr Muyongo is a politician who

for their country. I am referring to its
recent paternalistic reporting on the
attempt by Dr A Shejavali, General
Secretary of the Council of Chur-
ches, to get together all parties which
- are honestly supporting Resolution
435.
~ Onlya fool would expect this Party
Newspaper to show any support for
amove to unite the oppressed Nami-
bians, but the arrogance of its Editor
can no Jonger be ignored. In the edi-
_ tion of February 3 the ‘wise guy’ of
Namibian ‘journalism’ takes up issue
with what he refers to as the ‘cienaar-
dige inisiatief of Dr Shejavali.
Firstly he decides on what grounds
this initiative will enjoy the support
of all of them. Namely if the aim is

to get the parties outside the ‘puppet
show’ more approachable. The ques-
tion is: approachable for whom? His

group?

He actually has the cheek to
assume that these parties want to be
approachable to the surrogates of
South Africa, when all one has iodo
1s to deal with South Africa itself. He
then advises Dr Shejavali which par-
ties he should have approached if he
were interested in reconciliation -
namely the litle groups inthe MPC.

The poor man is such a victim of
his own propaganda that he actual-
ly believes they want ‘reconciliation’
while they are beating up people at-
tending a peace raily and detaining
people under AG 9 and 26.

The writer of the editorial is upset
because Dr Shejavali ignored the
people in the puppet show. If he had
read the invitation he would have

realised that it is not Dr Shejavali, but
the agenda of the planned meeting,
which excludes those in the MPC. It
is clearty stated in the invitation that
parties will discuss Resolution 435 as
n stands. Nobody in Namibia can
still believe the MPC supports
Resolution 435. They have proven
their opposition so often.

Who remains for Dr Shejavali to
speak to, he asks: | would like to in-
form him a littl. Net to Justus
Garoeb, but tothe Damara Council,
which has openly stated its support
of Resolution 435 and which has
more support than Shipanga, Kat-
yluongua, Mudge and the rest of the
Bevryders, Arbeiders and NP put
together. Not to Peter Kalangula, but
to the CDA whose legitimacy has
been adequately proven by the
dismal failure of elements in the ar-
my and government to topple him,

and which supports Resolution 435.

Not the Swanu ‘dissidents’, but
Swanu under the leadership of
Kuzeeko Kangueehi, Swanu which
never dissented from its constitution
and policy, Swanu which supports
the implementation of Resolution
435,

Other parties of which this ‘jour-
nalist’ is unaware are the Mbanderu
Council, the NIP, Nudo Pro-

Women’s Voice.

The soothsayer of Namibian
political journalism predicts that it
will be impossible to get these parties
together. He obviously already has
information about this. Is it Koevoet

Preserving the
status quo

THERE CAN BE no pretense. There
can be no cover up. Moses Kat-
jiuongua is a collaborator. Heis not
only a member of the MPC,
machinery set up by the South
African Government, the most ar-
ticulate member of a Cabinet pro-
tected by the South African army and
its secret services, but he also prevents
people from peacefully registering
their rejection of South African col-
onialism and oppression.

At a recent press conference he
said ‘to give people freedom Is not to
give them licence Lo turn against the
State’. These fateful words is ample
proof, not only of the extent and
depth of his collaboration, but the
fact that he is no nationalist but a
mere reactionary.

However devious his rhetoric, his
capability to ‘capture the imagina-
tion of the majority of the popula-
tion’ has been reduced to zero if it
ever existed at all. For to be a friend
of the state is to be a friend of tyran-
ny, brutality, violence, oppression
and similar vices.

The fact that the South African
rule in this country is illegal, her in-
struments, the Administrator
General, armed forces and national
assembly must also be without
legitimacy.

Nonetheless, Mr Katjiuongua sees

ic fit to state that ‘we must be seen to
be doing the work we said we would
do for the people of this country, and
we must justify taxpayers money’. He
even finds it necessary to attempt the
propaganda that ‘the transitional
government has committed itself to
changing the country to make it bet-
ter for its people’.

The laws that Moses Katjiuongua

helds are the laws that virtually the

whole Namibian population has
dismissed as oppressive and immoral
and have fought since the orjgin of
our political struggle and earlier.
Surely politica) stability means
preservation of the status quo, Any
change brought about by the Cabinet
will be of the type that fits with the
grand designs and strategies of South

Africa to retain contro! of our land |

and its resources.

Katjivongua deprives peace- |

loving men and women to make their

grievances heard in a peaceful way |
and asks these people to surrender —

uhetr genuine aspirations for justice,

peace and freedom in favour of |

docile acceptance of laws which are

an analhema to their interest and |

Women and youth exhorted to unite against aparthe

AS WE usher ja this year of peace
and harmony, Swapo must assist the
women to take an active role in the
political fe of oar country. Nocoun-
try in which women do not have
equality with men, can be truly
democratic.

Women of our country and all the
whites who identify themselves as
truc and sincere citizens of Namibia.
who are yearning for a change,
should be accomodated in higher of-
fices and responsibilities in the party.

We must continue tenaciously
with the struggle. consistentls
demanding the prinaples of one man
one vote to be applied.

The first stepistopiveesery adull,
irrespective of race or creed, the right
to vote. When citizens enjoy equali-
ty of status with others, then the bar-
riers of race and colour will disap-
pear and people will mix freely
together and will work for the com-
mon good of society.

Our peopk are the masters of their

own lives, designers of their own
future, and dictators of their own
destiny. The illega! rule in Namibia
must be brought to an immediate
end.

No government can continue to
impose its rule coercively in the face
of the conscious defiance of the over-
whelming majority of its people.

L appeal to all progressive forces
which are fighting to establish ge-
nuineand democratic institutions in
the country to unite and form a
strong blog. No minorities, whether
they be BMlack or white, can fear a
united people.

While Swapo and all progressive
parties and institutions in ts coun-
try are intensifying the struggle for
emancipation and human dignity.
Swapo must not turn down honest
and authentic talks which could lead
toaceasefire. Swapo must talk to the
apartheid regime and not tothe self-
proclaimed government of national
unily.

LETTERS

Women of Namibia! The hour has
passed when women were made to be
mere spectators of events. Your
husbands are not paid adequate
wages. Your children are walking
around with empty stomachs and
they do not receive a proper educa-
tion. They are taught in segregated
schools and you do not have decent
houses and recreational facilities.

You do nat have equality. with
men. The voke of oppression is hur.
ting vou and sou should naw de-
mand vour rights

Youth ofthe country! Do not give
into intimidation. Wedo not havea
legaladministration inthis country.
Those whe proclaim power do not
have the mandate. You are the
citizens of today and tomorrow and
the salt of this nation. It is to you we
are looking for new values. Come out
resolutely. Stand up for justice to

prevail in Namibia.

Remember apartheid is hike cancer
inthe body politic of the country. It
is repugnant with the symptoms of
hatred, fear and relentless violence.

To draw up a constitution at this
juncture without the participation of
all the parts concerned, is fraudulent
and an indignity to our very ex-
istence, Regard it as null and void.

Close your ranks in the spirit of
peace and harmony Surmount your
problems with vigour and determin.
edefrors, discharge your duties with
honour and fulfill vour obligations
promptly. Eradicate the abominable
policy of apartheid from the face ot
our country.

The State. President of South
Africa ty not sincere in his proposal
for the implementation of Resolu-
tion 435, and he has no right to link
the independence of Namibia with
the withdrawal of the Cubans from
Angola.

The Cubans are in Angola at the
invitation of the Angolan Govern-

ment, and ever since they went to that ;

country in 1975 to date, they havenot
attempted to violate the territorial
boundaries of Namibia or. South
Africa.

I see no logic m the proposal of the
State President. One would have ex-
pected Mr Botha to be more realistic
and practical on this desperate issue
of Namibia. An issue which took so
many years to discuss inthe interna-
tional forum.

Angola is a sovereign member
state of the United Nations and
under the present Charter of the
United Nations. No government or
individual has the right to impose
dictates on that government.

JP W Botha, as the leader of South
Africa, can only have the Cubans
withdrawn from Angola through
peacetul negotiations and not
critical and enipty proposals based
On malicious intrigues.

WITH THE recent propaganda
against Swapoon the part ofthe DTA
mouthpiece, I would like to bring the
following to the attention of the
public.

The facts about Swapo in that
mouthpiece are manipulated and
propagandistic in nature. The whites
who sit behind this propaganda are
exploiting the lack of knowledge of
our people. I

In 1899 to 1902 the Afrikaners
fought the Boer war. Let me mention
some factors in connection with this:

* the guerrilla war of 1899 to 1902 was
the first significant one in Africa;
*it was learned fromthem that guns
could be taken upasa last resortand
when allother possibilities had been
exhausted;

* 1-year old children fought in that
war;

* with their Calvanistic background,

they saw their war as rightful before
God;

* the Afrikaners did not separate
politics and religion;

* they were convinced they fought for
their country and freedom;

bd the homes and farms of the
Afrikaners were burned down bythe
enemy British;

* women and children were placed in
concentration camps, where more
than 22.000 children under the age of

16 are alleged to have died;

* Hensoppers were regarded as
traitors while bittereindes fought to
the finish;

* the traitors were sometimes
sentenced to death by firing squad;

* the Afrikaners were distrustful of
the English and their peace
initiatives;

* children of traitors could not be
baptised in the Dutch Reformed
Church.

Taking this into account, why the
fuss about the fact that Swapo is
holding their traitors in detention, in
much better conditions than those of
the Afrikaners during the Boer War?

Already, deep in the National Par-
ty hierarchy, inthe NP church, there
is a change against apartheid. They
are now beginning to realise the ir-
reparable damage done to the black
by means of apartheid.

View the propaganda of the
Republican Party with caution. Itis
the Broederbond's psychological
war against Swapo. Swapo will not
be broken. Shipanga and Muyongo
tried it and failed. Do you think
Maria Boois and Beukes will get it
right?

THE CHURCH is the body of
Christ and it is the responsibility of
the church to act in the spiritual,
social and political interests of the
community.

The Church should acknowledge
that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is to
be understood, not only in an ec-
chesiastical sense, but also in the
social, political and cultural sense.

The task of the Church is to work
for God's reconciliation everywhere.

The Church has a responsibility to
reject government policies which
deny people their human rights and
it must speak out against injustice
and preach the Christian message of
peace, freedom and reconciliation.

It should reject racial discrimina-
tion and racism and put forth renew-

ed efforts to live according to Biblical
norms. It should press the govern-
ment to promote fundamental
human rights, freedom and peace
among the people.

The Church is responsible for the
welfare of its people. It cannot re-
main uninvolved because the peopte
under the government are also
members of the church.

The Church has to realise that the
situation in this country is contrary
to the will of God. It has to struggle
for radical change in our society - for
genuine independence for Namibia.

YOU HAVE GIVEN Vice Bishop
Kameeta epace in your newspaper to
volce his opinion. I request thesame
opportunity since you call yourself
achampion for freedom of speech.
Mr Kameeta claims that the in-
dependence of Namibia is an in-

ty, Swapo, refuse to acknowledge any

Why doesn't Mr Kameeta use his
high office to ensure justice, panos
and freedom for every Namibian?
He is aware of the fact that Swapo
does not tolerate opposition. He
knows that everybody opposing
Swapo will be subject to arbitrary
punishment or even execution
without a fair trial. Mr Kameete
should cupport the call made by The
Namibian on Swapoto ensure a fair

hearing for those who are accused of
being spies for South Africa.

Mr Kamecta should be aware of
the fact that many political parties in
Nadnibia have urged Swapo to bean

tative of the people of Namibia’. Ms
Lister should inform Mr Kameeta of
what her experiences are concerning
this imposed status on Swapo. Mr
Kameeta, who has vowed to preach
love, peace and righteousness,
should be in the front to ensure that
every Namibia be granted the right
and the opportunity to work towards
independence of this country.

Mr Kameeta knows that Swapo
regards violence as the only viable
means of attaining independence for
Namibia, but does he consider the
fact that the majority people in this
country are peaceloving Christians
and ‘thus prefer a negotiated
settlement?

Mr Kauriceta calls for boycotts and

disinvestment and calls the potential
suffering of the majority of people
‘empty phrases’. Simultaneously this
Vice Bishop demands that ‘al! peo-
ple must have the right to decent
housing, and bring up their families
incomfort and security. Free medical
care and hospitalisation must be pro-
vided for all, with special care for
tentor citizens, mothers and small
chikdren. The aged and disabled must
be fully cared for by the State’.

Has it occurred to Mr Kameeta
that foreign investment is vital to
achieve these aims? Mr Kameeta is
fully aware of the fact that Swapo
and the CCN regularly call on inter-
national financial support to
alleviate the plight of the people.
Why then should only his party and
its followers benefit from Mnancial
aid and not the majority of the
people?

Will Mr Kameeta care to tell the
public how much he earns and how
much he pays in taxes? Will Mr
Kamecta be prepared to inform the
people of this country about the
lifestyle of those who profess to fight
for independence and tiberation
about their contribution towards the
alleviation of the suffering peoplein
the form of financial contributions?
Can Mr Kameeta inform the publicof
what he proposes should be donc to
obtain sufficient funds toatlain what
all the people in Namibia desire?

Mr contention is that Swapo is
guilty of the most atrocious
discrimination against peaple. Mr
Kameeta is actively engaged in
Swapo's political activities, this
makes him guilty of discriminating
against his own people too. Accor-

ding to the Oxford dictionary,
discrimination means to ‘make a
distinction, to give unfair treatment,
especially because of prejudice’.
Swapo and Mr Kameeta call
everybody who does not comply with
their conditions and with their opi-
nions, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pets etc. Everybody who dares to
speak against Swapo is threatened
and intimidated. Every person who
does not support Swapo is being
discriminated against. This is
definitely not what the majority of
Namibdians will support; this is what
the majority ofthe Namibians want
eradicated,

Mr Kameeta claims his fame and
right to speak about political matters
on his arrest and detention. For any
law-abiding citizen, especially for
devoted Christians, defiance of the
law is detestable. if Mr Kameetaasa
Vice Bishop and even more as a
Swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
alienable right to self-detesmination,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not support an
Organisation which sees only
violence as a means of achleving

what they desire, namety, to takeover
power of this country.
Mr Nujoma has declared more
than once that Swapo {fs not in-
terested in powersharing, bux only tn
power itself. During his recent pro-
paganda tour for Swapo in West Ger-
many, Mr Kameeta has proven thal
heis against any form of opposition
to Swapo and that he disputes the
right of freedom of speech of a Ger-
man citizen in hisown country. With
this act added to his political atsties
against the people of this country, Mr
Kameeta has disqualified himself of
claiming to be a champion for
freedom, Justice and peace.

The angry residents and their

totally against the actions of the

Obviously the people in the

While the police and army claim
to be the defenders of the people,
the Namibians themselves have re-
jected this claim, since Namibians
have experienced untold crimes at
the hands of these forces. These
cannot be erased from our minds.

NAMIBIAN independence Is
delayed by the entire western world
with their intentions of exploiting
our country's natural resources and
promoting the illegal occupation of
Namibia by the South African
Government.

In 1978 the United Nations pass-
ed a Resolution (UNSCR 435)
which was to pave the way for our
independence through UN-
supervised elections.

Both Swapo and South Africa
had agreed to the implementation
of Resolution 435, but when
Reagan came [to power in
Washington, he and South Africa
brought in the linkage issue. This
is now made a precondition to our
independence.

The Cuban Internationalists
have been in Angola almost three
years prior to the introduction of
Resolution 435. They were only
found to be a threat after six years.

This is a feeble excuse and ploy
by western capitalists regarding
Namibia.

We in Namibia have tried on-

three occasions to bring and end to
the shedding of blood and the suf-

fering of our people, but all were |

in vain. In Geneva in 1981, Swapo
was ready lo sign a ceasefire and
put Resolution 435 into @peration,
and this was repeated in Lusaka in
1984 and on Cape Verde later that
year, but the South African
Government turned a deaf ear.
Mr P W Botha told the world
that Swapo was the one delaying
independence and opting for
violence, whereas Swapo had stated

often that a ceasefire was the only —

way to end the war.

if Mr P W Botha could just tell
us openly that he is afraid of a
Swapo victory if Resolution 435 is
implemented. Swapo would win
the elections overwhelmingly,
which is why the Reagan Ad-

ministration is backing Pretoria on |

the Cuban issue.

The South African Government

is again playing with us by saying
that Swapo must talk to the interim
government in Windhoek. Why
should Swapo talk to their sur-
rogates? The country is not oc-

cupied by Mudge-Shipanga- —

Katjiuongua, but by Pretoria.

They talk of reconciliation, but —

They talk of reconciliation, but
Swapo has no quarrel with them.

The people of Namibia want
peace and freedom just as any
other country in the world.

The Reagan Administration has
gone as far as to invite Jonas
Savimbi to Washington. He is even
supplied with sophisticated
weapons like Stinger missiles and
the like to cause suffering among
the Angolan people. There is now
a form of military pact between
Pretoria and Washington to build
up their self-created Angolan ban-
dit group.

Reagan, with the support of
Thatcher in London, attacked
‘Libya recently, killing innocent
people of that country. Reagan ac-
cuses that country of ‘training ter-
rorists’, but one need only look at
the actions of the US in Grenada,
and now in Nicaragua, Angola,
Afghanistan and Cambodia.

In the UN debates, it is the very
Reagan Administration, along with |
other capitalist countries, which are
vetoing decisions taken against
South Africa and Israel. But it
never asked capitalist America
alongwith its allies, to impose
economic. sanctions against
Poland, lran and recently, Libya.

They are using the cheap pretext —
that the majority of blacks would |

suffer in South Africa, Namibia
and the entire southern Africa if
sanctions were imposed. This is.
nonsense, for we gain nothing from
the economy of our country. The
majority of blacks live in poverty,

and it is we who join the call for
sanctions against the South African
Government.

it is time that the world turn
their attention to the plight of the
people of Namibia and South

Africa under the apartheid
government.

AN OPEN LETTER TO
MR SAREL BECKER
AND FOLLOWERS

OVER THE years, when apartheid
was in its raw stages, it was mark-
ed with doors for 'Whites only’.
“Whites only’ could enter these
doors, regardless of their religion,
social standing, tradition or race.

The only precondition. wag that
the skin colour be ‘white’.

_ The man with the black skin had
to keep away from ‘your’ regions
and reservations.

[ will not ask what you have
against the colour of my skin, Mr
Becker. By maintaining this rigid
atlitude, you have made your
message clear to the blacks of
Namibia. As far as you are con-
cerned, there is no compromise on
apartheid without a colour change.

lronically, the very segregation
yOu are now seeking, was provid-
ed in the past. Someone was wise
enough to foresee conflicting
nature of the white man and black
man, and kept them apart. Your
forbears were in Holland and there
the chances of keeping your race
pure, were perfect.

On what grounds can you now
fence in the black man to safeguard
the purity of your white race if you,.
yourself, have broken the natural
segregation by crossing the ocean?

Of course we dare not overlook
the fact that your forbears brought
the first light of Christian faith and -
civilisation into the most southern *
part of Africa. This opened our
eyes to new horizons of education,
civilisation, faith and progress.

Incidentally, the white man also
introduced to us the first spark of
the gun, the very evil he suffers
under today. In fact the mass
slaughter of blacks on December 16.__
1836, is a festive day for your
government - contrary to the Chris-
Gan faith which strives for peace,
love and unity. - |

You came to Africa, heavily
armed and with apartheid.

Surely you are an advocate of
‘whites only’ churches, a religion
practised, understoad and accep-
table to only a small part of the:
community. With the help of God‘ |
we have partly outgrown that stage,

Lastly Mc Becker, your thoughgs '
do not justify your existence in ao

Africa, unless you change them .
and bring them into the open. | Soe

ALLOW ME to express my views
on Messrs Andreas Shipanga,

and what they are doing to the sul-
fering Namibian people.

As a brother and fellow coun-
tryman, | would be guilty if | did
not state my views in regard to your
present positions, labelled as
cabinet ministers by an unelected
interim government appointed by
the South African Government, be-
ing used as carriers of apartheid
and collaborators of the South
African Government; and being us-
ed to oppress the already oppress-
ed suffering Namibian people, your
own people, your own blood.

Did you know you are delaying
the country’s independence by
allowing yourselves to be used by
‘the South African Government

which is still exploiting our natural

civilian population.

How did you feel
giving approval to an
occupation?

Brothers, 1 want to remind you
that your forerunners, and others
who have sold out to the enemy,
are forgotten, and were discarded
like rotten fruit to the dustbin. You
should seriously reconsider your
positions in opposing your own
people.

You know you don’t have the
support of even two percent of the
Namibian people, so please open
the doors for Resolution 435 to
elect our leaders. We know them
well.

My message (O peace-loving
Namibians is that they should unite
and fight the darkness of evil
among us. Let us fight for our
future generations, and leave

Tribe after tribe

{ AM an Ovambo-speaking man
who is very disappointed with his
fellow countrymen.

1 was told I could get a job in the
building construction industry’ in
Tsumeb, and had to see a man at
the Tsumeb Municipality. He told
me to come back the following
morning at 07h00, which I did, and
he made me wait all day. I was
eventually told I could not get the
job, and then after a friend of mine
again requested, I was told to go
to the Municipality once again.

When J did so, the man told me
there were no jobs for Ovambo-
speaking people, but only
Damaras, Namas and Coloureds.

Some of our brothers in govern-
ment offices treat others on a tribal
and discriminatory basis. While the
Ovambo-speaking people are those
who are suffering the most, one has
to hear that they are ‘thieves and
terrorists’, and they are
discriminated against in job
situations.

| had used my own money to go
to Tsumeb for that job, and had no
place to sleep and nothing to eat.

Blacks alwavs blame the whites
for discrimination and racism, but
some of our own people, like the

Municipality, are oppressing their
own people.

We should learn from these
mistakes so we should not make the
same mistakes tn the future.

Our country is torn by war and
this situation will only be resolved
if the people of the country can
work hand in hand for peace. This
peace will only come through love,
and an understanding of our duty

Sanctions: Yes

a )
THE CALL for total economic
sanctions against apartheid South
Africa is justified. South Africa has
rejected all reasonable demands to
do away with the outdated and
_ degrading system of apartheid and
oppression of the blacks.

The promoters of economic
sanctions have the real interests of
the oppressed masses of South
Africa and Namibia at heart; and
economic sanctions is the alter-
Native to total war. In fact
economic sanctions is a call for
‘peaceful change’ to enable the
blacks to govern in the land of their
birth and creation.

Those who are against economic
sanctions are only trying to protect
their own interests and exploitation
of the blacks. The claim that the
blacks would suffer if economic
sanctions were applied, should be
rejected with the contempt it
deserves. The blacks are suffering
already and additional temporary
suffering won’t matter to us as long
as freedom is achieved.

The blacks have no economic in-
terests to protect and defend - their
main interest NOW is to Hberate
themselves at all costs.

The US and British atthude is
Clearly capitalistic and self-interest
aimed at protecting the {a-
vestments. The fear of economie
loss is stronger to them than the
freedom and lives of the blacks in
apartheid South Africa. It fs
because of the double standards of
the Western powers that blacks
have lost interest in slogans like
‘democracy’. Blacks lived in peace
and harmony until the arrival of
the white settlers and colonisers.

It fills one with dismay to hear
about blacks saying that apartheid
is dead in Namibia. Apartheid in
Namibia is still alive and kicking,
even the socalled black ‘ministers’
complain about apartheid meted
out to them by secretaries of other
‘ministers’.

The abolition of apartheid is not
what we are calling for - we are not
fighting for reforms - we want to
GOVERN this country. We are
fighting for the right to decide our
own destiny and our destiny is not
linked to apartheid or neo-
colonialism.

The whites of this country are
not prepared to change or ready
themselves for change. They still
believe in their oppressive doctrines
and dogmas.

Even the Secretary for Finance
is calling for methods to prepare
against economic sanctions; instead
of calling for drastic changes in the
status quo in order to meet the
reasonable demands of the op-
pressed masses.

The whites must remember one
thing: they may be in a temporary
position to delay independence, but
(bey cannot prevent it.

The whites are shouting that they
are fighting on the border to defend
their rotten symem of apartheid.
They should femember that we
never invited them here with their
oppressive system, and now they
are calling on us blacks to defend
and fight to retain oppression and
apartheid.

We hear that the army is 80 per-
cent black and 20 percent white -
but who are the 20 percent? They
are the elite, the white officers, the
ones in charge. The 80 percent
blacks are there only to run errands
and to be ordered to kill their own
kith and kin.

If the whites are prepared to die
for what is not theirs, what about
us who have a country to regain
and a people to liberate? Whites
should remember that violence
breeds violence - they have practis-
ed violence since the first white
man put his foot on Namibian soil
and have not stopped ever since. In
fact they have accelerated it. Blame
for any violence or bloodshed
should be placed squarely at the
door of the whites.

Dear Ms Lister

-YOUR ‘Political Perspective’L
published on August 1 was a
remarkable piece of writing. There
are many points on which one
could comment; only one 1s,
however, of sufficient importance
to require a response. .
Neither I nor any part of the
consultancy service ‘favour’ one
Minister over another. This would
be wholly inconsistent with our
charge from the Cabinet. The con- —
sultancy’s task is to make the goals, —
aspirations and achievements of the
Transitional Government known in
circles of influence abroad. We do
this to the best of our ability, with,
I believe, some degree of success.

Dear Mr Cleary _

YOU too have done some ‘remarkable’
pieces of writing, most recently in
Leadership (Volume $ 1986 Number 2),
in which you measure the success of the
interim government by means of the
vague generalisation of ‘inclusivity’.
This ‘government’, you say, seeks to in-
volve all parties and also to draw to
these same parties, the support
previously enjoyed by those outside it.

May we remind you (hat there are six
parties (some in name only) which en-
joy membership of the interim govern-
ment. Membership of ‘other parties’,
however minor their support, who have
shown interest in the interim govern-
ment, has been turned down, and I refer
in particular to the recent HNP request
for membership of the ‘Constituuional
Council’.

‘Inclusivity’, therefore, hardly seems
to be the goal of this interim
government.

You have not explained why the DTA
prefers to operate outside your ¢on-
sultancy service, and it has been wide-
ly reported (not only in The Namibian)
that there has been a breakdown in
communication between yourself and
Mr Dirk Mudge, an interim government
minitter you claim Lo represent,
What is perhaps of note, is your
f reference to the 'Transitional Govern.

""AN OPEN LETTER TO DR
ABISAI SHEJAVALI

NEITHER YOU, Dr Shejavali, nor any
of your colleagues of the Council of
Churches (CCN) have as yet reacted to
the barbarous bomb attack on innocent
civilians in Walvis Bay on August 2.
Nobody expects you as a Christian to
take sides in the struggle over
SWA/Namibia, but as a christian you
should condemn all forms of violence.
You did not and have never before con-
demned violence and atrocities commit-
ted by Swapo and therefore I take it for
granted that you condone one form of
violence and condemn another suiting ©
your own political whims and
aspirations. |

As the majority of my countrymen
I condemn violence of any form to
achieve political aims. Nobody denies
that members of the security forces do
commit violence against members of the
local population. Such members are
however brought before court and [ can
substantiate this statement with a list of
trials. | do however assume that you
doubt the impartiality and in-
dependence of our courts of law.
However it may be there is not one case
Swapo has brought before a courifof
justice to try one of its members can-
mitting atfocities against innocent
civilians.

On the’ contrary: Swapo cold-
bloodedly. murder a mother and young
child in Grootfontein. The same peo-
pe kifled two parents in front of their

daughters on a farm near Okahan-
oe ‘After one of them was sentenced
p dats and Mibsequently harigeti,

) 9 hailed f him asa martyr,
in most of Swapo’s publications
which are circulated as widely as possi-
ble, this organisation lists the numbers
of landmines they have laid. Often the
‘names of people who were murdered
also appear on these documents. Swapo
also acknowledges abductions of young
men and women. These atrocities are
Jauded as acts in the struggle for in-
dependence. Mr Katjavivi says people
are not abducted, but only taken to be
re-educated.

Neither you, Dr Shejavali, nor any
of your colleagues have ever condemn-
ed these senseless atrocities against in-
nocent civilians. On numerous occa-
sions, internally and abroad, you have
publicly called for support for Swapo
in its struggle against the ‘oppressors’.
Not once have you called on Swapo to
cease the atrocities against civilians.

Power pylons, electric installations,
water pumps, reservoirs and telecom-

munications links are being sabotaged |

by Swapo: These acts of sabotage are

Is my assumption justified that you
support Swapo's numerous calls and

that you reiterate threats made by
Swapo leaders that Swapo will
demonstrate its power if her
unreasonable demands are not being
met; that you know Swapo has in-
timidated inhabitants of this country by

threatening to step up their acts of

violence which includes specifically
bombings?

The murderous attack on civilians in
Walvis Bay on August 2 was one of
those bombings which Swapo threaten-
ed to execute. If this is not the fact, then
you Dr Shejavali, should request Swapo
to deny responsibility for this atrocitly

others for their courage in meeting

_ with the Swapo leadership in

_ Lusaka at the 10th anniversary of
‘UNIN.

They have showed us that there

are some whites who want to see
~Namibia freed from South African

example to other whites, to show
where they stand in the struggle
towards a non-oppressive and non-

I would personally like to call

Let us unite: black and white and

Reply to Shipanga
MR ANDREAS Shipanga said in
a recent letter published in two
Windhoek newspapers that ‘Many
of our members and thousands of
other Namibians were not so for-
tunate. They were imprisoned, tor-
tured, raped and murdered ...’

Was this what you were doing
when you were one of the Swapo
leaders? I ask this because you say
you ‘know’.

It is also not the first ime you
accuse Mr Sam Nujoma, our Presi-
dent, of being ‘stupid’. [ don’t need
to tell you just how dynamic our
President is; he who led our peo-
ple, Swapo, through very difficult
times, and because of Mr Nujoma,
South Africa has failed in her ob-
jective to destroy Swapo.

Victorian language was never 2

uisite for charismatic leader-
ship. President Nujoma speaks
good English, and | remember a
white woman once said: ‘I, 0 far,
have failed to understand Mr
Shipanga’s English’.

Do you remember that you

threatened to withdraw from the

circus by September 1986 if
i AG 8 were not by then?

ONCE, America told the world that
the ‘constructive engagement’ policy _
was there to encourage peaceful
changes in the apartheid policy of —
South Africa. Yet the Reagan Ad-
ministration assists South African
militarily against the freedom
fighters.
I do not know whether Mr Ronald
Reagan and his administration know
what the word ‘peace’ in the real
sense means. The policy of ‘construc-

communist encroachment on South

country. :

There are numerous multinational
companies operating illegally in
Namibia today, viz. CDM, Rio Tinto,
TCL, Soekor and others. These com-
panies are mining Namibian minerals
contrary to UN Decree Number].

Millions of tons of diamonds, copper,
and metric tons of uranium are ex-
ported illegally to N ato-member
countries.

The Namibian people, under the
leadership of Swapo, the sole and
authentic representative, have tried on
many occasions to oust Pretoria from
Namibia but because jthe racist
government has the ba-+ing of the
capitalist West, this has not succeeded.

When one travels Namibia, one sees
evidence of how our resources are ex:
ploited and exhausted. The freeway
down to the south is always full of
heavy duty trucks loaded with cattle
being taken to South African markets,
while many of our children are looking
for food in rubbish bins and are sleep-
ing with empty stomachs. There are
more bottle stores than educational
facilities.

And while our natural resources and
agricultural potential ia being ex-
ploited, our independence is made con-
ditional to the withdrawal of Cuban
troops from the People’s Republic of
Angola. The Cubans have been in
Angola for almost eleven years now,
and are only seen as a threat by the
cowboy regime in Washington.

Ifapartheid Pretoria had not invad-
ed Angola in 1975, there would have
been no Cubana there today. Pretoria,
is responsible for what happened in

If IS my contention that Namibia
needs a unitary education system to
guide its people and control its rate
of development. |

The powers of education should be
centralised. We need a government —
which ig committed to secure the
cooperation of the people of this coun-
try. We need a democratic govern-
ment which rules by a constitution —
approved by the majority of its peo
men hiehranes.?

Ny

higher standard of living and social

security in Namibia. We need
quate food, shelter and medical ser-
vices. We need education for personal
growth and happiness. We need a
strong government.

In Namibia each ethnic govern-
ment has an education minister. The
purpose of this education is to equip
the African child for his place as a
labourer in Namibia. The ministry of
education is given unrestricted
powers to decide what achools should
exist, service for teachers and the
content of black education. It plans
fo separate one race from another.
Economically, politically and social-
ly, whites are at the apex and blacks
at the bottom. The emphasis is on
quantity and not quality. The educa-
tion of blacks is inferior and teaching
is done through the medium of ver-
naculars up to Standard Six, then
there is a sudden switch to learning
English and Afrikaans. The standard
of English in particular has dropped
disastrously. The black student is in
a terrible dilemma for he either ac-
cepts such education or gets no
education at all.

It is my contention that there ia a
need for a clear national educational
policy in Namibia, and a compulsory
and unitary education system.

Blacks and whites should govern
the country in harmony; we share

many things and should share the |

land under one government. We
share a common history and culture
and we can speak to one another in
our national languages. Namibia
needs a national symbol! to give usa
sense of belonging as a nation.

Education should not separate
black and white; and children should
not be taught that blacks are lazy, in-
ferior, stupid and 80 on.

Education for black children is
scarce and inadequate. It is the cause
of all the political unrest in Namibia.

Namibiansa do not see ethnic
governments as their governments;

or the constitutions as their constitu:

tion; they have, become politically-
divorced and frustrated. se

In the final analysis, we need a
strong unitary government againat

external forces, because unity, le

strength. We need new mathods of

organisation, new mie new in-
sions. We
need a climate in which Namibie can |

Not starving

I WOULD like to respond to a report
in the interim government propagan-
da mouthpiece of November 3, which
criticised church-run schools in the
territory.

Mr Andrew Matjila, Education
Minister, said that we were disad-
vantaged because we _ were
undernourished.

Church schools are contributing
much to our country, and our eyes
and minds are kept open in these
schools. We have a fair system of
education, and we feel at home.

Coming to Mr Matjila’s point that
we are locked into our hostels: this
is not true. Everyone has the right
to go home with the permission of
staff members, and this is a sign of
order. We are protected by the church
_ as future leaders of this country. .

Truly speaking, we are thankful for
the good we are getting. We eat in
order to survive and not to get fat as
he is doing. If he wants to make us
fat, then they have to implement a
system of equal education in this
country.

Mr Matjila should also not confuse
himself about Swapo and the Coun.
cil of Churches. They are using the
money for peaceful means, while he
and his colleagues have grabbed
possession of the country, including
the education system.

He and his colleagues spent a for-
tune on military training, while peo-
are dying. Leave church schools

q ° peace, for they are working for
rh, O09? Sd justice and humaniam in

y «Al
The things mentioned in that
report are occurrences at schools
resorting under Nationa] Education.
Many of them are undernourished,
and they are also locked up, like at
the Augustineum, where students
are afraid of the Koevoet security

When I look at what happens at
State schools, I do not feel bad about
the situation in which myself and my
colleagues at church schools find
ourselves. What happened at the
Augustineum, Mr Matjila? There
they are locked up and are forbidden
from participating in student
organisations, such as Nanso.

This is a sign that their rights have
been taken away. We are happy to be
at church schools, because our minds
are free, and we have the opportuni.
ty to air our political views.

Mr Matjila, think before you speak.
Leave the church schools in peace.

Myself and fellow Namibian
students dream of the day when
equal and fair education will be
granted to all. Education without
liberation is worthless.

ASA socalled white South African, liv-
ing in Jchanneeburg, and not a
member of any one of the great number

of political parties in Namibia, I feel I

have the right to try and objectively

assess the incident of November 30

where the supporters of Swapo were

routed by what is generally known
here as Koevoet.

I was invited to the peace rally (sic)
by friends. I went there because, being
a South African, 1 thought ‘How
wonderful. I always thought Swapo
was a banned organisation’ (At least
that is the way I was indoctrinated by
the press in South Africa). So] went.

It was quite an experience. People
singing and dancing, a group of
children splendidly dressed in Swapo
colours, dancing to the tune of a whis-
tle, blown by a small boy. And the
Swapo police! Dreesed resplendently,
some with wooden AK-47 rifles,
painted blue, green and red. Tradi-
tional kieries and spears (covered with
cooldrink cans to make gure the sharp
points cause no incidental harm).

The peace rally was opened with a
prayer. An old black man, praying in
Afrikaans, for the rally to be peaceful
and in the name of God. There were
some speeches and then a group of
socalled vigilantes started injuring
people and damaging cars inthe road.
They were chased away by the Swapo
police and we all started singing again,
determined to allow peace to get the
upper hand.

The next moment Casspirs arrived.
Much too soon to have been summon-
ed from the police station. They were
close and ready. The hatches flew open
and the firing started. Horribly sud-
den. A terrible and unecessary act of

ked violence.

The air was thick with teargas and
rubber bullets. We all ran, blinded and
choking. They never stopped. On and
on. We hid in houses from the choking
fumes, babies gasping old men lying on
the ground. They chased us from hotse
to house I ran like a scared animal,
jamping over fences, chicken coope,
washing the burning skin of my face
and eyes in basins filled with soapy
washing water.

After halfan hour, things quietened
down. I ventured back to the area. |
crossed a poo! of mud in a street, sud-
denly realising my my stomach chur-

that it hadn't rained. It was blood.
mud. I put e note under a wind-
sereen of a friend'scar.

Then they came again. I crawled
wortlike under the car. | knew | would
he at the very least injured ifthey saw
sue, white person, there.

By ugw they wore firing teargas at
random into houses. Houses of people
who weren't even at the rally. Houses
with emall babies, screaming and

hide. In the house, an old woman,
maybe ninety yearsold, embraced me,

saying over and over Jy moet leef, my

hind. Jy moet leef, my hind:

Eventually I reached safety through
rides with other reporters. That was
yesterday (Sunday). Today (Monday)!
read the news: “People started fighting
among themselves .. the police
endeavoured to bring peace ..”” and
worst of all, this line in an editorial col-
umn: “This time Swapo will have todo
much more than the tradjtional ac-
cusation that the police are responsi-
ble for the violence’ (Translated from
Afrikaans).

Whatcan I say, except, that ifthese
are the workings of democracy, Nami-
bians should wake upto reality. Do not
allow your fut and the future of
your children, to be placed in the hands
of demented perpetrators of violence,
acting under the cover of reality. I beg
you, wake up.

' THE ISSUE of the increase of water:
_and electricity in the Caprivi is
creating some division among the
people. The one group is prepared to
spend every cent they have on these
tates, and the other group is reluc-

— toileta, bathroom drains and even in-
let pipes are ineffectively done, thus
resulting in the wastage of kilolitres
of water. I wonder why the
maintenance office are so interested
in the number of kilolitres rather
than the number of repairs to the

I believe every official working for
a certain authority is a civil servant
and thus entitled to the benefits due
to civil servants, but one wonders
when one sees in the Caprivi that
some civil servants are given about
500 units of electricity free of cHarge,
while the other group of civil ser-

The one group gets all the

of discriminatory hatred among the

Unless certain people start to work
for the interests of the majority, then
they can forget about cooperation and
peace of mind among the suffering
majority. |

Distortions

THE ARTICLES in the interim
government mouthpiece of 11.12.86
and 19.12.86, are malicious and a
blatant distortion of the truth. The
allegation against Mr Shapua
Kaukungua is that paper's own
fabrication. They are writing what
they probably wanted to hear. I am
not surprised by these lies, because
a system based on lies, cannot be
defended with the truth.

| repeat my statement made in the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in
Katutura at Mr Shifidi's funeral that
the “socalled government of national
unity is morally responsible for his
death”. The death of Mr Shifidi is an
urgent call on this ‘government’ to
step down, and in so doing, allow the
implementation of UNSC Resolution
435,

As long as this ‘government’ is in
power, it will be responsible for the
blood of the Namibians which has
been soaking the soil for more than
a century. What happened on that
fateful Sunday of November 30 last
year was not a mere ‘bakleiery’ as
that newspaper pretends. which is
why we are demanding an indepen-
dent judicial commission of inquiry
to reveal) the truth.

his government to allow the appoint-
ment of such a commission if ita (the

ratte For us, the struggling
masses of Namibia, it is now time to
reflect on the happenings of the past
year. Was it a successful year as far
_ as the struggle is concerned? Did we
achieve what we set out to achieve,
and if not why?

First of all we must find answers
to these questions before we can plan
for the new year. The aim of our plan-

should be to make a success out
of failures of the past and to
achieve our independence. It is aleo
now time for us to state our aims and
purpose as clearly as never before.
We should state our views without
fear or favour.

Our aim was and is and always
shall be the independence of our
country. It must be every Namibian’s
wish and desire to be free ... and |
mean free in the real sense of the
word. -

Our independence is not
negotiable. We have negotiated for
too long hence the long delay in ob-
taining our desired independence.
Our direction should be very clear ...
independence now and at all coats.
We should stop these half-hearted ef.
forts. We should go all out to liberate
our country. |

The call and onus is on us to unite
the divided people of Namibia into
one cohesive liberation front or
movement.

The unity I am talking about is not
unity for the sake of shouting that we
are united ... 1 mean unity of purpose
and action ... the purpose being our
liberation. We must have the purpose
of fighting the common enemy and
even more ... to defeat the enemy. We
have nothing to lose but our chains.

We must learn from our mistakes
and those of our forefathers and rec-
tify them before it is too late. We
should also learn from other African
countries.

The time for talk about unity is
long overdue. It is now time to act
unity. It is time to involve all the
Namibians in the unity of purpose
process,

The masses must ask their leaders
to unite them for the sake of our in.
The time for talk about unity is

‘We should not give the enemy the
chance of further dividing our
already. divided people. The enemy
did it by creating eleven ethnic
governments. He did it by buying
and bribing some of our people. He
did it by his political ideology - ter-
ming some of us terrorists and com-
munists. He is stil) doing it with his
radio and TV broadcasts. Finally he
is doing it by taking some black
money-mongerers into towns to
create a black middle class-cum-elite.
The irony is that these blacks think
they are destroying apartheid. The
truth is that they are being used to
strengthen apartheid.

Multiracialism and liberalism have
never been the friends of those under
oppression. All these terms tend to
create divisions in the liberation
movement and some confused blacks
tend to think that by associating with
whites, they are better than other
blacks. History has proved that white
liberalism is an enemy of the atrug-
gle for freedom. Whites cannot
enslave us and at the same time
claim to be our liberators. Freedom
is not a gift, its a victory, and that
victory will only be achieved by the
blacks themselves. History has pro-
ved that whites in the ranks of the
liberation movement tend to be spies
and informers. Whites tend to be in
control or to control whether they are
in the majority or minority.
Wherever the whites went, they went
to control.

Socialism is the basis of the African
culture and also part of the African
‘revial and struggle to regain the lost
glory and freedom. Socislisnis a way
of life for the Afriean at not a
foreign, imported ideology as claim-
ed by white capitalism. Blacks own-
ed everything commonly, even the
moet powerful kings did not claim or
own private land or waterholes.
Socialism should not only be preach-
ed, but practiced ... in fact it should
ba lived. We as socialists should put

ple should be prepared for the Great
Socialist Revolution which is going

Namibian masses must stand
together and cal] and end to the op-
preasion meted out to you. If the
leaders are not taking any initiative,
then you are at liberty to take actions
to liberate the country. Let us make
1987 the final year of our struggle for
independence.

We have been hearing about peace
and reconciliation in Namibia ..
what a misuse of words and terms.
The fact is there is no peace in
Namibia and there won't be peace in
Namibia unless the enemy is driven
out and we resume our rightful place
and control of our country. There
won't be reconciliation in Namibia
between the oppressed and op-
pressors. What are we reconciling?
Oppression? No way. The real peace
and reconciliation will come when
the black man has come to hia rights
and power. We cannot talk about
peace and reconciliation in Namibia
unleas we are trying to bluff
ourselves as the white liberals are do-
ing today. To the white liberals we
say: you cannot achieve or solve
anything by working with your pup-
pets or tamed blacka. The key to the
solution of the Namibian problem
lies with the true blacks ... the
revolutionaries, We are holding the
key to peace, freedom and tranquili-
ty in Namibia, ee

I REFER to the letter: which ap-
peared in The Namibian of February
6 1987, written by Mr Clive Algar,
Rossing Uranium's public affairs
manager, accusing Swapo’s UN
representative, Mr Helmut Angula,
of making “extravagant statements’
about Rossing.

As I looked at Mr Clive Algar's let-
ter, I quickly realised that this was
& public relations officer painting a
good picture of his company.

First. and foremost 1 would like to
hear from Mr Algar who has
authorised Rossing to mine uranium
in Namibia. According to my sources,
this company was given a green light
by South Africa in 1970, four years
after the UN General Assembly
revoked South Africa's mandate to
rule Namibia. Was Rossing ignorant
of UN Decree Number 1 which clear-
ly states: “No person or entity,
whether a body corporate or uncor-
porate, may search for, take, extract,
mine, refine, use, sell, export or
distribute any natural resources
whether animal or mineral situation

. within the territorial limite of
Namibia without the consent of the
UN Council for Namibia”.

Namibia. Any collaboration with the
racist regime, means you have
automatically declared yourself an

Whatever you are trying to do for

the fact that you are ‘giving’ them
what is theirs after robbing them.

Mr Angula was speaking in the in-
teresta of the oppressed and suffering
people of Namibia.

ACCORDING to a report published
in the Republikein of March 6 1987,
interim government Minister, An-
dreas Shipanga, ‘sharply criticised’
and expreseed his ‘disappointment’
about certain statements the Vicar
General of the Roman Catholic
Church, Father Bernhard Nor-
dkamp, had allegedly made during
an address given at a youth seminar,
which, again according to the report,
is said to have been organised by the
Council of Churches. The report
relates to what Mr Shipanga is alleg.
ed to have said during a meeting of
the National Assembly on March 5
— 1987.
Mr Shipanga, acearding to the
report, bases his claim about what
the Vicar General had said during
the youth seminar held at Dobra, on
a letter by an unidentified “Win-
 dhoek student” which letter was
_ published in the Windhoek Observer
af February 28, 1987. The “student”
alleges, inter alia, that Father Nor- |
| dkamp had said that “law andorder }
| are sin”. For the purposes of this |
statement it is sufficient to state that
the letter contains further very
serious distortions and outright un-
truths, It represents nothing but a
very ill-considered attempt to smear
the Roman Catholic Church and to
‘discredit the Vicar General, whose
commitment to bringing about

tian society in Namibia ia well

bitrary executive powers which are
vested in him and his colleagues in
the Cabinet of the interim govern-
ment by virtue of numerous socall-
ed security laws, which would clear-
ly require the greatest measure of
restraint and responsibility. These
laws not only offend againat fun.
damental human rights, but also in-
vite serious abuses of due process and
the Rule of Law.

It is most disturbing that Mr
Shipanga, at the taxpayer's expense,
and protected by a statutory immuni-
ty against possible legal action,
repeats unchecked allegations by an
obecure letter writer and then, on the
basis of those slanderous allegations
proceeds to ‘sharply’ criticise a senior
and respected Priest of the order of
the Oblates whose dedication
towards the protection of Christian
values in this territory can hardly be
questioned. :

SEVENTY-five percent of the Herero

ing their brutal colonial rule over
Namibia. The Nama people were
reduced to 50 percent. The problem

through which South African col-

As a Namibian, a victim of that

to read in the Windhoek Advertiser
of November 21 1986 that the Etango
movement received 30 000 Rand

Etango (like Koevoet which is link-

the South African Defence Force, and
therefore linked to it. ‘‘Donations""’
from West Germany mean to every

of Namibians, prolonging the col.

the suffering of Namibians.

published an article attempting to
throw suspicion on Christian Ac-
tion asa front for the Defence Force,
because an officer of the SWA Ter-
ritory Force is a member of Chris-
tian Action. This open letter is sub-
mitted for publication to inform in-
terested persons and the public at
large of the true facts of the
controversy.

MS GWEN LISTER:

YOU apparently have serious problems
with any person or event that is not in &y-cor-
dance with your figments of the imacina.
tion regarding situations and related events
in our country. You chose to ignore Chris-

tian Action’s request that you submit in
writing your questions about CA to us. In-
stead, your action was to attempt to cast
suspicion on Christian Action in public.
Christian Action will therefore follow your
example in using the public media to afford
all interested persons the opportunity to
read what Christian Action stands
posed to what you stand for. We pale
ly ch you to consider investigating

Action, and to publish your fin-
dings. We, in turn, will definitely not
hesitate tokeep the publicinformed of CA's
activities.

Ms Lister, you and your accomplices were
requested in no uncertain terms to submit
in writing your queries about Christian Ac-
tion, to ensure that Christian Action if not
victimised by a person's own, possibly incor-
rect, understanding of the true meaning of
comment made by Christian Action.

You however considered yourself too
elevated to correspond with honest people.
You even went to far asto twist the little we
did say. Christian Action’s request that was
that you put your questions in writing so
that we would have a clear understanding
of your inquiry, and you would have an ab-
solutely clear understanding of our reply.
The material would then have been very
useful to both you and ourselves should a
misunderstanding have arisen. Would such
action not have been more responsible and
professionally journalistic?

You, Ms Lister, really have nothing
against Christian Action assuch. You have
a tremendous amount to say about the fact
that Christian Action vehemently objects to
socalled clergymen who are more involved
with politics (and not even objectively) than
with their spiritual taske. It is nosecret that
Christian Action identified the fact that cer-
tain socalled clergymen attempt to mislead
their congregation so that anti-christians,
communists and suchlike can force their
own ideology which contradicts the Bible,
on their people. Therefore, all you could do,
Ms Lister, was to attempt to cast suspicion
on the strong point of view made by a
member of Christian Action.

What you did will not work, Ms Lister. You
forget thet Col Radmore is not Christian Ac-
tion. You forget that Col Radmore is a
Stoalelicnd fhetatian whn dna not hasitate
member of Christian Action.

What you did will not work, Ms Lister. You
forget that Col Radmore is not Christian Ac-
tion. You. forget that Col Radmore is a
disciplined Christian who does not hesitate
to acknowledge his strong belief in and love
for the Lord in public. You fail to appreciate
the fact that Col Radmore is one of the many
who knows what atrocious and senseless
terrorist deeds Swapo and their puppets
commit among the population. You, Ms
Lister, will possibly not be able to unders-
tand why a person like Col Radmore can be
outspoken for the Lord. You are seriously
mistaken, Ms Lister, when you think that
through naive mudslinging against a per-
son, youcan cast suspicion on Christian Ac-
tion, amongst fellow Christians. There are
many Christians, Ms Lister, in this lovely
country of ours, who like Col Radmore are
genuine in their belief. Many are members
of the Defence Force, the Police Force, the
private sector, the state, businessmen, even
newsmen and women.

Ms Lister, you gofurther in your attempt
at casting suspicion by insinuating that
Christian Action could possibly be con-
nected with the Department of INforma-
tion. Forget these tactica, they don’t work.
Christians have direction. They know what
the Lord expects of them, and they don't
need to be connected with anyone or
anything other than the Lord. We will sup-
port each other, and jointly we Christians,
irrespective of where we are, will fight Satan
in whatever form he may appear. Ms Lister,
you will be astounded to hear how many
members of Christian Action and other
Christians support thia viewpoint, and who
differ with you in this respect.

Hundreds of people support Christian Ac-
tion, Ms Lister. Many, many Christians
have contributed financially and otherwise
to enable Christian Action to reach out to
fellow-Christians to inform them who the

real enemy is, and to tell how certain

we can serve the Lord, and that we are not
dependent on the whims and woes of Swapo

Christian Action will not cease to keep
fellow Christians informed to what degree
socalled clergymen are involved with
recruitment and incitement of youth to sow
death and destruction as young terrorists,
and of how socalled clergymen are

often preach, that Swapo is the only

We will also continue to indicate how

socalled clergymen are involved with inter-
national terrorist groups to prevent Chris.

tion will also continue giving people like
you, Ms Lister, the opportunity to meet eye
to eye with genuine Christians who per-
sonally experienced how Swapo and their
allies persecuted people who refused to ac-
cept and support an anti-Christian ideology.
We will go to extreme efforts to show how
falsecertain ‘clergymen’ and their imitators
are in their preservation of basic human
rights. You, Ms Lister, know that we are
referring among ethers to the socalled
‘Swapo 100”. You yourself have appealed to
Swapo to give these people a fair trial, and
to advise their next-of-kin and to permit
legal representation for these people. You
Ms Lister, have done this, but noclergyman
bas made such an appeal.

There are many more aspects that Chris-
tian Action will convey to you and the in-
habitants of this country. You will be plac-
ed on our mailing list in future. We do,
however, reapect the feelings of every per-
son, and enjorse the Charter of Fundamen.-
tal Rights as is expected of true Christians,
and therefore don't mind if you ignore our
newsletter. You know that the truth often
hurts. Don't fear that Christian Action will
force anybody to accept what we say. We tell
what we know. Christian Action does not in-
timidate. Christian Action does not require
anybody to move from door to door to
threaten people will death ifthey will not ac-

not plant mines, or plant bombs in butcher
shopa and service stations, or destroy the
homes of innocent people with explosives.
Christian Action will also not call on

decipherable, so the public is as much
in the dark as ever about socalled

lengthy missive serve to shed more light
on this mysterious organisation. It con-
sists primarily of waffling on your part,
Colonel Radmore, and references toor-
dained priests as ‘socalled clergymen’
shows that you yourself are involved in
senseless mud-elinging and politicking
on behalf of certain instances. You may
well serve the Lord, but you serve the
SADF as well, and the First Command-
ment is ‘Thou Shalt Not Kill’. In previous
correspondence of your organisation,
you also claim that you are able to
monitor the comings and goings of
clergymen at military bases, which
would seem to indicate you convenient-
ly use your SADF affiliation in your
‘Christian Action’ propaganda.

The simple fact is that negotiations

between other Namibian parties and
South Africa, will not achieve this. It
can only be achieved in negotiations
between Namibians espousing dif.

We understand why Swapo wishes to
sign a ceasefire agreement with South

In struggle

I WOULD like to refer to an announce-
ment in a recent radio programme
stating that churchleaders should not
be involved in politics. Why is this the
case?

Obviously churchleaders are our
guides in the struggle. They are the
ones who can truly solve problems,
especially regarding the “beatings
and torture” by Koevoet in northern

Namibia.

Churchleaders must be involved in
politics because they are true
peacelovers of Namibia who are strug-
gling for peace and freedom; because
they love their people and country, they
must try to defend their people by tell-
ing Koevoet members to stop their
intimidation.

Churchleaders, keep it up! Do not be

The fact that South Africa's interests
are mt at stake here, probably explains
why that government formally aban.
doned its demand for UN impartial.
ty in Angust 1983. The fact that our in.
teresta are at stake explains why
Namibian parties who do not enjoy the
benefits of UN bias, continue to make
this demand.

Why prese for negotiation and
reconciliation before in-

Because this isthe on-
by way in which political compromise,

peace, etability and a decent shot at
economic prosperity and national
reconstruction can be' achieved in
Namibia.

Thesimple fact is that negotiations
between Swapo and South Africa or
between other Namibian parties and
South Africa, will not achieve this. It
can only be achieved in negotiations
between Nemib:ans espousing dif.
fereint views.

We understand why Swapo wishes to
sign a ceasefire agreement with South
Africa and why it does not wish to
negotiate with other Namibian par.
ties. By signing a ceaufire with South
Africa, Swapo will gain preatige and
will be seon as the winner

1 WOULD like to refer to an announce.
ment in a recent radio programme
stating that churchleadera should not
be involved in politica. Why is thiathe
case?

Obviously churchleadere are our
guides in the struggle. They are the
ones who can truly solve problema,
especially regarding the “beatings
and torture” by Koevoet in northern
vO en ae

eight years. And how could it be

attack of doing - gloes bver or sideatep
uncomfortable facts and bend reality
to suit their limited purposes.

Tb turn instead to a few substantive
points raised in the text:
Why a Constitution before elec-
tions? So that you know what you are
going to get. A constitution is the
skeleton of a country’s political
aystem; the set of parameters within
which the political contest between
parties espousing different ap-
proaches, is regulated. Constitutions
reflect common values, not the
political preferences of a (temporary)

mapority.

Building on the constitutional prin.
ciples and guidelines of the Western
Five - adopted at the instance of the
much-maligned Reagan Administra.
tion - set out in Annexure J to the
NPP-435 study, all that is necessary
now, is to agree on a constitution em-
bodying these principles, before
elections.

Can the members of NPP-435 really
be 90 gullible as to wish to rely on the
possibility that Swapo - a most
undemocratic organisation, as al]
Namibians with any experience of it
know - will abide by abstract principles
limiting its power, if it is under no
obligation to do so.

Constitutions, in setting limits on
the freedom of majorities to work their
unfettered will on others in society, are
the best guarantee of civilised govern.
meant yet developed. They are best con-
structed 90 as to be acceptable - as the
rulesofthe political game -toal]in any
national society, not just to a tem-
porary majority. Perhaps this is the
point the authors have missed.
Exsuse of UN Partiality The pro-
tagonists of the present arrangements
in the UN are often least comfortable
when addressing this point.

The facts are that SWAPO has been
deciared since 1973, by the
General Assembly, tobe the “sole and
authentic representative of the people
of Namibia”. As a consequence of this

and other actions of the Assembly, it
enjoys the status of ‘permanent
observer’ throughout the UN system.

Those who have had the opportuni.
ty todiscussing these matters with UN
Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, can testify to his personal
discomfort and emberrasament at the
& dilemma

AN OPEN LETTER to the
Executive Committee of NPP-435
concerning the booklet entitled
The Choice: Namibia Peace Plan
435 or Society under Siege

THE conscientious reviewer of this
weighty essay is confronted with
several dilemmas. Is the pamphlet in-
tended, as its authors suggest in the
preface, to“... present Namibians with
the facts ... and thus to provide them
with with the opportunity of assessing
for themselves the situation and to
draw their own conclusions..."" or isit,
as the authors claim, only three
paragraphs lower on the same page “.
to strengthen the commitment of (cer-
tain) churches, parties and groups to
the immediate implementation of
Security Council Resolution 435'?

Is it intended toconstitute analysis
or advocacy? The compilers seem
undecided

Are the authors, ifthey intend topro-
vide a dispassionate analysis, naive or
disingenuous? If they intend to ad.
vocate @ cause, are they merely in-
competent or do they underestimate
the intelligence of their readers?

ps the most distressing factor

of the work is that, despite its gran.
diose claims, exotic style and partisan
tone - even the Namibian Chamber of

Reply to Kozo

WE HAVE read, with interest, a letter
received from Minister Kozonguizi
typed on a letterhead of the Depart.
ment of Information, indicated that
even such letters are done at the tax-
payer's expense.

Minister Kozonguizi's epistle is
what hecalisa “review” of our booklet
- “The Choice - Namibia Peace Plan
435 or Society under Siege”.

The booklet attempts to present
Namibians with the facta and by the
provision of these facts and the
analysis of these facts, to strengthen
the commitment of all those who call
for immediate implementation of
Resolution 435 of 1978.

It constitutes analysis as wellasad-
vocacy. It stands however in stark con-
trast tothe type of advocacy and distor.
tion of facts by the Honourable
Minister and al! thoee institutions,
parties, groups, persons and
mouthpieces with whom the
Honourable Minister, his government
and the South African Government, is
closely associated.

It presents the truth in rebuttal of
the propaganda daily poured out for
Mr Kozonguizi’s cause and financed by
millions, if not billions of Rand from
the pockets of the South African and
Namibia taxpayers, and in the case of
Namibia - without the consent of the
taxpayers and without the consent of
Namibians.

If ever there was denigration
without facts and without reason, you
see it inthe Minister’s letter which is
typical of the mass of propaganda com.
ing from that source.

According to the learned advocate
who has never practiced in this coun-
try, advocacy is unethical or un-
professional conduct for an advocate.
Does he not know that lawyers, ad-
vocates and judges do not only
analyse facts, but also come to con-
clusions, make submissiona and
reach judgements on the facts.

Why aconstitution before anelec-
tion? This matter is dealt with ade-

quately in our booklet and readers are
referred to it.

We can all agree that aconstitution
is one of the most important pillars of
a stable democratic state - if not the
very foundation of it. But surely such
an important basic document must
represent the will of the people of
Namibia otherwise it will have to be
imposed and then it will not be worth
the paper on which it is written. To
represent the will of the people, it
follows that only truly elected
representatives of the people can
represent the will of the people.

And toelect such representatives of
the people who will then draw upacon-
stitution for Namibia, in the exercise
of their self-determination and right
to independence, is the very aim and
essence of Resolution 435 of 1978.

After the constitution so drawn up by
the elected representatives, there
could be a further election for the first
government of Namibia in termsofthe
agreed constitution. That will in effect
mean aconstitution before anelection
for a Namibian government.

In the case of Namibia, however,
there already exists an international
agreement, on the inclusion of certain
specified constitutional principles and
fundamental human rights in the
future constitution of Namibia and
also safeguards for the protection of
minorities in the form of a provision for
proportional representation and for
the further details of the constitution
to be decided upon by at least a two-
thirds majority.

So it is clear that even here a com-
promise has already been reached
between those who want a constitution
first and those who want an election
before a constitution.

Swapo has consistently stood by the
peace plan and the democratic elec-
tions provided for in it, whereas
Minister Kozonguizi, Minister
Shipanga and others show no sign of
suggesting any sort of country-wide
elections to legitimise their appoint-
ments by the SA Government. Have
you redefined democracy, Minister
Kozonguirzi? If so, please let the “‘in-
telligent”’ readers have your definition
and your government's plan of action
for democracy, self-determination and
internationally recognised
independence.

If your vague allegations against
Swapo are trut, you should welcome
elections in terms of Resolution 435 of
1978 because then you can attack and
denigrate Swapo in their presence in
front of the Namibian people. The
peace plan provides for the return of all
refugees and one can imagine the
many witnesses then becoming
available to substantiate these
charges, iftrue. Why miss such anex-
cellent opportunity to free the tortured
refugees and confront Swapo face to
face? The Namibian people can then be
the judges. When the Honourable
Minister denigrates Swapo, he should
remember that he himself set out the
options for Namibian resistance after
the 1966 World Court decision on
Namibia, when in an article in African
Forum, he declared: ‘In fact, the deci-
sion of the International Court of
Justice has had one positive result: It
has underlined, for the people of South
West Africa, thata direct confrontation
with the Government of South Africa
may be inevitable Unless the South
West Africans are prepared to work
from within, to rely primarily upon
themselves, to mobilise their own
physical and moral resources, it is dif.
ficult to see how, in the forseeable future,
South Africa can be uprooted from its
entrenched position within the Ter.
ritory. Since experience has taught
Africans that external intervention in
a struggle for liberation has never pro-
ved decision against an organised in-
ternal force ltke that of South Africa,
final victory in South West Africa can
be guaranteed only by a disciplined
resistance movement, abovue-or
underground, within the country
self""

“Hf this ts the case, then the choices
before the people of South West Africa,

whether political or military, are only
four: In the political realm the choices
seem to be three: (1) capitulation - by
which I mean that South West Africa
may bow to fate by accepting the South
African settlers and abiding by the dic
tates of the Pretoria government; (2)
negotiation - tn the hope that the SA
Government may modify tts position -
which would amount to capitulation,
(3) indifference - in the hope that other
countries, other powers, may take up
their struggle and attain freedom for
them. None of these, especially the first,
seems very likely.

The fourth is armed struggle -
which is always easier to discuss than
to plan, easier to organise than tocarry
out, for tt must be pursued with
ruthless determination to win and
it must be reinforced by a princip}-
ed dedication to the cause. From
thier public pronouncements, it seems
clear that the leaders of South West
Africa are moving in the direction of
armed struggle”.

It appears that the Honourable
Minister has since 1966 accepted the
first option above viz. “Capitulation...”

What basis do Namibians have for
believing that the interim government
willabide by whatever constitution it
might draw up, when it is responsible
tonoelectorate having never facedan
election?

Excuse of UN Partiality: We
acknowledge in our booklet the fact of
UN partiality, but we explain why it
will not have any effect on the judge-
ment of Namibians in a 435 election.
But why don't you acknowledge South
Africa’s partiality? Why not?

The Honourable Minister of Justice
has often inthe past reiterated that in
Africa power comes from the barrel of
agun, and we suspect that he and some
of his associates have accepted this
credo.

It seems futile to argue with the
Minister about free and fair elections.
If interested in elections at all, it will
have to be elections which he can be
guaranteed to win - and free and fair
elections are unlikely to lead to that
result.

Negotiation and Reconciliation
before Independence: There is
nothing wrong with this aim in prin-
ciple. But this aim must be bona fide
and the opportunities for negotiation
and reconciliation not abused as hap-
pened in 1961 in Geneva and 1984 in
Lusaka.

Itis not a requirement of of the peace
plan for Swapo to “sign a ceasefire
document with South Africa” even
though it may be useful if they do. All
that is required is that both SA and
Swapo indicate their willingness toim-
plement a ceasefire So the alleged
disadvantage to ani-Swapo parties in
that Swapo will gain ‘prestige’ by
signing a ceasefire document withSA,
does not exist.

Minister Kozonguizt’s government's
existence isin breach of its own socall-
ed BillofFundamental Rightsinthat
the said Bill provides that a govern.
ment derives its power and capacities
from the consent of the people Such
consent it never obtained and Minister
Kozonguizi also shows no intention to
face the electorate.

In conclusion we note that Minister
Kozonguizi has, despite his long
treatise, not told us whether his
government wants to stop the war
and if so how it will achieve this, in
view of the fact that it has no con.
trol over defence, security and
foreign affairs.

We undertake to be constructive and
even handed. We will the Minister and
his colleagues will in future do the
same. We can begin with a televised
debate on the issue ifthe Honourable
Minister can arrange this with the
Government's television station in
Namibia.

I WISH to air my disappointment
about the issue of permits to the
travelling public between Rundu and
the Caprivi.

Fellow Namibians, it hurts tosee the
travelling public suffering likethey do
inthe country of their birth. Ever since
the introduction of the issue of permits
by the SADF eight years ago, it seems
that Namibians are not much concern-

- edabout it.

The permits in question is not a
statutory law ofthecountry butrather
an imaginary law introduced by the ar-
my to cause severe hardship to Capri-
vians and the travelling public.

The army should immediately and
unconditionally do away with the issue
of permits, for if not, Namibians will
be left with nooption than tochallenge
the validity ofthe permits in acourt of
law. Members of the travelling public
are checked and their clothing left in
the dust road, after every 50km stretch
from Bagani to Kongola.

A poor Caprivian motorist with his
family, was travelling from Katima
Mulilo to Windhoek and at the
Kongola army checkpoint was ordered
todrive 120km back to Katima to have
his provision of fish written on the
socalled permit. He had to refill hiscar
with petrol for a second time although
the permit in question does not
stipulate the inclusion of provisions of
any kind. Though you are in possession
of the permit, it does not offer you pro-
tection of any kind, because it is
stipulated that you travel at your own
risk. What is the use of carrying
something that does not give you any
protection? What is the use of iden-
tification cards issued to Namibians
and residents? The behaviour of Up-
ingtonians and people trom the Cape
is intolerable and they must be sent

- back to where they.came from.

While having sympathy with

following problems are contributing to
the problem viz:
A) Population Growth:

food production, housing resources,
schooling, Health services and pod crea-
tion. As @ result the population
becomes poorer and poorer, and the
economically active group smaller in
proportion. It is always tempting in an
effort to redistribute wealth, to heavi-
ly tax this group. Care must however
be taken not tokill the goose that lays
the golden eggs.
B) Drought:
Namibia isa semi-desertcou ntry and
droughts are part of life. The problem
arises when the odd few good rainfal]
years are taken asthe norm and no pro-
vision is made for the inevitable bad
years in nature's cycle.
C) Farming Methods:
Farming methods are sometimes very
destructive, especially in the com-
munal areas. There, no rotation graz-
ing isimplemented and very little con-
trol is exercised over stock numbers.
Traditionally the number of cattle iB
a symbol of wealth, irrespective of their
condition. Owners are alsooften loathe
to sell their cattle, even in times of
drought, with resultant destruction of
grazing and death, as witnessed a few
years ago in Kaokoveld. The result is
the same as in the Sahel region in
North Africa. Man has totally upset
the dalicate balance of nature for short
term gain, with longterm destructive
results, . | |

Guerrilla War:

a result of the political uncertainty and
lack of international recognition, in-
‘vestments are not readily made in
‘Namibia, with resultant meagre job
creation. The spill-over of the war in
Angola, streches our limited resources
with refugees.

E) Good Medica! Services:
As a result of good medical services
more people survive in an otherwise
often hostile environment. There is a
sense of fatalism and the beliefthat the
State will provide for all needs. This is
often demanded as a right which the
State has to satisfy. Unfortunately this
demand is not matched by responsibili-
ty or contribution. In order to try and
solve the problem, and to avoid an
ecological and biological disaster, the
problem must be tackled with political
will.

A) Population Planning:

Namibia isny arichcountry. Many of
its resourcis are transient e.g.
-diamonds(CDM), base minerals(TCL),
uranium (Rossing), gas (KUDU), and
gold(Karibib), When the mines close,
this source of income is gone. The
resources remaining will be farming,
fishing, tourism and human. If the
human resource is planned and nur-
tured it will be the most important. |
One just has to look at Japan, a coun-
try with virtually no natural
resources, but an incredible human
resource.

Due to the population explosion,
China has taken drastic steps aiming
at one child per family. Parents who
want more will have to pay and forfeit
free services and free schooling. This
may sound very radical but one hasto
be cruel to be kind. The alternative is
another Ethiopia. Here the initia!
worldwide enthusiasm and Bob

ages faded aid mismana

Population planning can also not be
seen in the white/black political con-
text. Already blacks outnumber
whites by more than twelve to one.
rv ae it is two to one or 12 to one

“ae.
vote election. Therefore population
planning as a form of imperialistic,
capitalistic, racial suppression, has no
logical or scientific basia.

With the present growth curve,
demands on health, housing, food,
education andemployment, are in ex-
cess of supply, and the situation is
worsening. Demand greater than
supply boosts inflation, whichinturn
aggravates poverty even further. It is
a vicious cycle. Only a firm political
statement of intent and action, can
break this cycle. It will require a brave
man to doit, but if successfull, he will
go down in history as the man who
brought progress and prosperity. Peo-
ple will become independent of, rather
than dependent on the State.

B) Farming Methods:
Farming methods must become scien-
tificand conservative. Namibia is vir-
tually only suited to livestock and
game farming. The delicate ecological
symbiosis must be nurtured for future
generations.
C) Political Settlement
' (AG8 and Resolution 435):
. The guerrilla war can only be ter-
minated by a political settlement. Itis
often said that Namibia must decide
its own future, but to most who have
followed the political yo-yo game, it is
obvious that outside sources from a
number of sides are manipulating our
future. A settlement will hopefully
bring peace, stability, investment and
prosperity. |
D) Good Medical Services:
Good medical services must go hand in
hand with education and economic
progress.
E) Political Independence:
Political independence depends on
economic independence. Namibia’s
resources must be developed by Nami-
bians for Namibia, with help if
necessary. Presently symptoms and
not causes are treated. This only
postpones a solution until it becomes
insurmountable.

Man has been able to control all
other formsofliebut not himself. One
_ of the few people still inharmony with
nature is the Kalahari bushman. He

You don't help a poor man by giving
him a fish, but by showing him how to
catch a fish. The aim should be in-
dependence not hand-out nurtured
dependence.

I WISH to express my point of view con-
cerning the recent visit of high.
ranking South African Government
Ministers to Namibia. One wonders
why they do this because it has no
meaning for Namibians. Is it possible
that South Africa’s Defence Minister
could concern himself with the Con-
stitutional Council?

_ Did they come here to talk about the
real situation in Namibia, or did they
come to give instructions to their
pawns in the interim government? Did
they come to re-inforce the curfew
restrictions? What is the purpose of
protecting a minority when they
disregard the wishes of the majority?

Namibians are suffering daily, long-
ing for independence, crying for self-
determination and implementation of
Resolution 435; but our human digni-
ty is detrimentally affected by the
socalled SA DF and SWATF, the latter
created illegally in our country.

l feel their visit was a provocation to
the oppressed people of Namibia, and
those who welcomed them here must
be people who have lost interest in
Namibian affairs.

Let SA leave Namibia in peace; let
them give the Namibians what they
want and forget about creating confu-
gion with an appointed, i
government which works under SA
control.

Their daily Afrikaans language

ALLOW ME to respond to the letter
_ | published in The Namibia of July 10,
entitled ‘Coward Lister’.

First ] would like to inform Mr
Mungunda and his Union that Lister
| is afairand honest editor. The weekly
paper, The Namibian, is presenting

| the true facts of what is happening in

this country. The Namibian is the on-
ly real newspaper in Namibia which
prints the truth about the country.

Lister did not berate and insult the
Hereros as you alleged. The paper
| revealed to the public the ungodly
| work of the Nudo members. It 1s self-
evident that Nudo members and their
‘bishops’ are South African proxies,
who are used by the colonial govern.
| ment to disrupt meetings of pro-
| gressive forces and character-
lassassinate Swapo members and
supporters,
| Donot migjudge Lister or accuse her

falsely. We the public know of your dir-
ty tricks.

Worst of all, you claimed that your
Union(Namibian Churches Unionjis —
a ‘truly Christian body’. Your letter |
had nice terminology but lacked reali- |
ty and is confronted with countless |
| dilemmas. OT i

Your letter covered the true core |

check your facta before you picked up

| You can't call your Union a ‘truly

Christian body’ when it stated that

“we have no political prisoners, no
state ofemergency. We have the right
of assembly and freedom of speech’’.

Against thisbackground your Union
proved itself anti-Christian and
anti-humaneness.

Today we live under the ungodly
system of apartheid, which is devour:
ing the Namibian children, but your
‘truly Christian body’ stated that
‘human rights are being carried out
through the government on the basis
of our Bill of Rights’. On the contrary,
on July 5, Swapo supporters were
beaten up on their way toa Swaporal-
ly and an eight-year-old girl allegedly
beaten by police. Is this what your
Vinion refer to as ‘freedom of speech
and the right of assembly’.

In the north our people live under the
agony of horror and death. Church pro-
perties are destroyed daily. Is thishow
human rights are guaranteed by the
BillofRights? Here again your Union
proved clearly tobe the mouthpiece of
the interim government. All the gocall-
ed ‘bishops’ appear to be DTA
Inembers,

The ‘truly Christian body’ also
Btated that Swapo is not banned, but
today Swapo supporters and sym.
pathivers are the victims of Koevoet,
police and Nudo vigilantes, who are in
the pay of the colonial government.
Then again you stated that Swapo
should not hire political priests to
negotiate surrender,

‘Swapo is a Namibian liberatio

uimovement formed. by the oppressed |

are you in this regard?

Dear priests of NCU, don't turn aho-

THERE IS a considerable number of
Namibians who really do not unders-
tand the historical process through
which we are going, particularly with
regard to the armed struggle against
the colonial occupation of this country
by the SA regime. The socalled Veripi
Mungunda is one of them.

In his letter dated July 17, he made
serious, irresponsible and reactionary
statements. In the first one, he alleges
that Swapo has no popular supporter.
I, the writer of this letter, would like to
challenge him to travel through the
country and test the popular support
of Swapo by questioning the masses on
the credibility of Swapoasa liberation
movement. If he did this, he would
definitely clear out his brainwashed
mind.

As far as his second statement iscon-
cerned; which implies that Swapo
makes use of the Council of Churches
and Namibian facilities in order to
carry out its political activities, my
question is: is their anything wrong
with it? Is it wrong for peace loving peo-
ple and genuine Namibians to gather
together, to thrash out the good from
the bad? No; Mr Mungunda. Once
again, you're confused. In the Nami-

‘bian context the CCN and The Nami-

bian’s Editor forms the good, while the

alliance between the Namibia Chur-

ches Union(NCU) and Nudo, form the
ad.

The latter is a grouping on tribal
lines to delay the process to freedom.

directly responsible for the atrocities

the newspaper which does not conceal
the truth.

On 22-7-1987, the chairman of a
parliamentary group in London, Mr
Nicolas Winterton, spoke over the col-
onial Radio Owambo, and expressed
dissatisfaction with the bomb explo-
sion in Windhoek afew weeks ago. He
said that the Swapo office in London
should be closed down because that
organization did a bad thing by plan-
ting the bomb.

Mr Winterton I want to know
whether you have certainty that the
bomb was in fact planted by Swapo.
Real proof is what I need.

Mr Winterton, you say that you'are
are feeling bad about the bomb in
which no one lost their lives, and
already you want the office of
Namibia’s true freedom fighters to be
closed down. A real pity.

In the meanwhile you ignore the
despicable misdeeds which are being
committed by South Africa. For exam-
ple, Mrs Alina Shilongo’s house which
was destroyed by South Africa’s
Casspirs on 3-7-1987. That was the
house of an aged woman of 80 years.
Should it have been your grandmoyuer,
what would you say?. Give an anver
to that. Of course you are not feeling
any disquiet because her skin is
black.

Winterton, neither you nor South
Africa’s apartheid is wanted here in
Namibia.

You must be happy about what your
friend, South Africa, has done by
shooting and killing an innocent
schoolgirl. (Laina Taapopi, 8-7-1987).

And now you are saying that Swapo
has committed a misdeed, and its of-
fices in London should be closed.

In that case, would you ask that
South A frica’s ‘offices’ be closed down
in Namibia? Should they close because

Winterton, when you say that you

not enjoy majority support from us

We Namibians have a high regard for
Swapo as the organization which is
challenging South Africa, and which
wants Resolution 435 to be im-
plemented, and the withdrawal of
South Africa from Namibia.

We want true independence, and not
the many little groups which are being

Africa, and which are there only tofur-

Mr Andreas Shipanga, look how the

THE CRY of the Namibian masses has
gone up for the umpteenth time to
vanish into the annals of ignorance
and hatred.

The plea of my people for self-
determination and unobscured self-
rule has been met with brutal assaults
by members of the notorious Koevoet
against those who dare tosay it aloud.

So the war, waged in Namibia in

serious attention to the following:
| last year a beautiful complex, a
clinic, was built in the black township.
The black community complains
about the lack of medicine and say that
only painkillers and Panado are
available. Many could lose their lives
because of this.
(~ Old-type toilets are still in use in the
township. The workers who take the
buckets from the toilet do it at their
own risk. They are not even taken toa
doctor for a general check-up. When
they become sick they are paid off.
Those who die rest in peace, but the few
who gurvive death are kicked out of
their homes if their rent,is in arrears.
(1 the socalled single quarters are in
a very bad condition. The one room you
rent is only big enough for a bed, and
- you have to pay R10 a month. The
rooms are not private and are divided
with 1,5m walls in the middle.

- with holes which makes it difficult for
vehicles to drive safely. va
[- onething that really surprised me
isthat there are more than a thousand

old houses. Some of them are in the pre-
cess of falling down. The local
authorities have plastered and painted
only 70 ofthem, and have provided the
materials for 40 hirers to do the job
themselves. The rest of the people have
been told thereis not enough money for
the project and that the rent would
then increase by R5 or more. Present
rentals are R25 for a four-roomed
house: R20 for three rooms; and two ©
rooms, R15 a month. Many of the
renters are jobless men and women
and pensioners.

The local authorities mention in

control our economy ifthey retain the
land and our freedom will be in name
only ... something like the MPC is
claiming today. That will be a sham
freedom within poverty, white domina-
tion and exploitation of our wealth.
Such independence is definitely not
worth fighting for.

We must fight for the land and all our
natural resources. I believe that this ia
the only solution for the black majori-
ty of Namibians. The whites are still
controlling the farms and the economy
in Zimbabwe and those who fought
during the war are not satisfied at pre-
sent. The Zimbabwean government is
trying to solve this problem which |
realise is a very difficult task at this
stage. This is why in the case of
Namibia we must grab our in-
dependence in terms ofthe ownership
of land. We must show to have learned
the lessonsof African history. The land
belongs tothe people of Africa and not
to those who call themselves ‘Euro-
peans’ in Namibia.

We cannot promise our sacred land
to the very same white farmers who
support the all-apartheid white Na-
tional Party of settlers in Namibia. We
cannot give our land to those wha, in
the May 6 elections this year, return-
ed P W Botha to power inorder topro- |
tect their minority rights in Namibia.
We cannot give our land to white
farmers who train Koevoet and who
are themselves commando members
in the South African army.

Since whites do not compromise on
any issue so far, why should we com-
promies our birthright? The masses of
our people shall take over the land
from the white monopoly capitalists

regarding the socalled Owambo an-

Ol These announcers are blinded and
misled by South Africa not to see the

They are used as instrumentsby SA to

deaths of freedom fighters in such a
way that it causes panic, wrath and
hatred amongthe peace-loving Nami-
bians. They appear to keep silent on
the deaths in units such as SA DF,
SWATF and Koevoet. Furthermore
they urge people to believe the latter
suffer no casualties.
(_) Female announcers are guilty ofthe
same things.
L’ Most of these announcers have
become resident in the towns of
Oshakati and Ondangua and hardly
visit their places or origin. They are
fully disconnected from the nation. If
they are on a reporting mission, then
they are given an army escort.
C] They are used to promote the in-
terests of multinational corporations

their products such as liquor and
cigarettes, but neglect to urge the na-
tion regarding education, health and
agriculture. ©

Saluting Ponhofi

I WOULD like to air my views on the
socalled leaders of Uukwanyama’sre-
centcal for army reinforcement inthe
region.

In the first place, I would like to
salute my comrades, fellow students of
Ponhofi Secondary School, who called
upon the SADF to withdraw from the
region, in particular the Ovambo Ad.
ministration and many other victims
of the racist Pretoria regime.

Inthe second place I would like to in.
form Messrs Kwautima, Dan and
Nghihulifwa and their disciples in the
region that we want freedom and not
AD extension and intensification of op-
‘pression and victimisation as is the
case in the north presently. [f Mr

Kwautima genuinely wants freedom
and security then he should fight for
the implementation of Resolution 435.

Itseemsthat the men in question do
not know what Resolution 435 is. They
simply believe that Koevoet wil! bring
stability in the region.

IfKwautima, Nghihulifwa and their
followers cannot exist without the ar-
my and Koevoet, then they should go
together with them, and leave Nami-
bians in peace,

Kwautima claimed over Radio
Owambo that even Chief Mandume
had soldiers. This may be, but Man-
dume did not fight his fellow Nami-
bians but fought the same colonialism
which we Namibians are fighting
against today. How can Kwautima
compare himself with a man like
Mandume?

Whatever Kwautima does, he and
his followers will never win the people's
hearts and minds. Students of Ponhofi,
you must not be intimidated by these
people. You must not surrender your
attitude of resistance tothe SADF We
are all with you and behind you.

We shall not be intimidated by South
African surrogates and their puppets.
The army and Koevoet must pack up
and go.

3 You will be surprised to learn that
my colleagues and I have had an avid
interest in the compound system for
more than 12 years. We have been
deliberating and negotiating with
numerous instances and governments
to abolish this system. The main
reasons, amongst others, where toen-
sure that those people who worked and
lived far from their home and their
familiesshould be given the chance to
live in peace and tranquility and
should not be controlled by Swapo's
henchmen through intimidation and
victimisation. Secondly, we were con-
vinced that the majority of those
workers were honest people who
desired to be employed and to earn
enough money to support their
families, but that they inevitably
became, directly or indirectly, involv-
ed in the conflict between criminals
and the poliee.

4. If you or anybody else is seriously in-
terested to find out what if means to
liveina compound, I will be glad toar-
range a meeting with people who knew
the situation and whocan inform you
of the truth. I will ensure that you will
not be lied to or mialead by people who
profess to know the situation, but who
were never interested in the people liv-
ing in the compound. | |

6. I do agree with you that there is

cerning practical implications of
destroying such a structure, as the
compound, built at such a cost. Con-
trary to you and a few others who
started making noisesonly a few days
ago about the destiny of the compound,
I was involved in and am aware of
many, many options which were con-
sidered to maintain the structures of
the Katutura compound, but none
seemed feasible. The TGNU andother
responsible institutions and bedies
have repeatedly requested contribu-
tions toensure an acceptable future for
the structure.
7. The most important aspect which
you and other people wantonly forget
when criticising the government is
that thousandsof people are involved.
My colleagues in the SWA Police are
aware of the plight of those who lived
in compounds. That is why we did not
criticise or protest in public, but we
_became actively involved in finding a
solution. A solution not to our own pro-
blems, but a solution for thoap honest
and law-abiding citizens who could not
escape being intimidated by terrorists

families. |

I am proud to have made a concrete
contribution, no matter how small it
was, to the destruction of the Katutura
compound and to allow my coun-
trymen to otcupy an own home
together with their families. I know
that these menand their families will
eventually have the peace they desired
andthatthey will graspthe opportunt-

I have never before experienced so
much affirmation for my beliefs as on
Friday afternoon when thousands of
my fellow countrymen witnessed the
destruction of the compound with joy
_and satisfaction. The small
demonstration by insecure people who
were deserted by the organisers,
helped toemphasise the majority ofthe
people who want positive changes
which contribute to a stable future for
our country and its people.

NAMIBIA has turned intoa military
camp because the SA regime are
building up the military in our coun-
try. Namibians are conscripted into
the socalled SWATF to fight against
their brothers and sisters. The SADF
uses our country as a springboard for
attacks on our neighbouring states. IN
northern Namibia the SADF and
Koevoet units are committing
atrocities against innocent civilians in
various Ways.

The Botha regime are not ready to
sign a ceasefire with Swapo to bring
about peace, democracy and economic
stability in southern Africa. The
Botha government also wants to top-
ple the MPLA in Angola and install
the Unita puppets, as they have done
in Namibia.

Inhuman and draconian laws have
been forced on the people of this coun-
try; particularly the oppressed black
majority: I refer to the curfew regula-
tions in northern Namibia; the check-
point at Oshivello where blacks are i)]-
treated by the notorious Koevoet:
refusal of passports to progressive
leaders; Proclamations AG 26, 9 and
Section 6 ofthe Terrorism Actin terms
of which police have virtually
unlimited powers.
The SA government is also engaged
in the indoctrination of Namibians:
organisations like Etango, Ezuva,
Namwi Foundation and Ichtus are
there to mislead, confuse and distort
the truth of the liberation struggle.
Etango, the socalled religiouscultura!
group rules with the Bible andthe gin.
Has no-one told these organisations
that Namibians are not communists:
they are oppressed instead by those
who brought the Word of God to Africa.
The oppressors also infiltrate black
schools by means of involvement in
sport, and cadets.

Recently, two makakunyasfrom 101
and 202 Battalions respectively, spoke
of discrimination within the socalled
SWATF; said they were forced to fight
on the side of Unita in Angolan ter-
ritory; and resignations have started
because they are not ready to fight
their brothers who want to liberate the
country from the Botha regime. It isa
lesson for us to reject and condemn con-
scription and instead call for the
withdrawal of the SADF from Nami-
bian territory.

The recent invasion of the SADF in.
to Angola: the SADF isthe obstacle to
peace in southern Africa. They are
destabilising the Angolan economy,
and both the SADF and Reagan Ad-
ministration supply the Unita bandits
with Stinger missiles, sophisticated
armaments. The aggressor should stop
fighting for Unita and instead
withdraw its troops from Angolan soil
A Resolution was adopted inthe UN
callingonthe SADF’s withdrawal from
Angola. The SA representative
responded that they would not
withdraw unless foreign troops were
withdrawn from Angola. This is unac-
ceptable and stubborn because the
MPLA Government has never
declared war against South Africa;
Fapla troops have never attacked or oc-
cupied SA territory; Angola is a
sovereign country which hastheright
to choose its own friends. |

and white, andraise their voices in pro-

IN THE WAKE of Christmas and my
dealings with The Namibian during
1987 I foe) myself compelled to write
you this letter in my personal capaci-
ty in order to set the record straight on
the real meaning of the words peace
and goodwill.

After an in-depth study and research
on the reporting as presented by The
Namibian during the past year! come
to the conclusion that no objectivity
was portrayed by your newspaper con-
cerning the South Weet Africa situa-
tion. Instead, you tried to portray the
enemy, Swapo including all its wings
and associates as the “peace-seekers”.
Nowhere could I find a cal! to stop ac-
tions by these organisations which are
detrimental to our country and all its
inhabitants, euch as boycotts,
sabotage, etc. Na, you rather opted to
go for the “alternative view” of
revolution.

Let me give you only one example:
Just about every week some kind of ac-
trocity by the security forcea was
reported. The security forces spelt iot
out clearly that no atrocities by

of the security forces
would be tolerated. Members who
are found guilty by a court of Jaw will
be punished accordingly. However,
when Swapo claimed responsibility for
the bomb blast at the Gustav Voigts
Centre you reported it to be “a
demonstration of Namibian people's
tesolve to shake off the yoke of col-
onialiam by all necessary means”. Is
this promoting peace and goodwill?

Swapo opted for the revolutionary
methods some 21 years ago and let us
be honest, they've lost face, both
militarily and politically Although
you portray this organisation tobe the
“true liberators” of thie country, |
guarantee that freedom will be
something of the past IF they should
take over the reins. However, that ia
hardly to be foressen.

In you socalled “bumper edition”
dated December 18, 1987, to January
8, 1968, you predict another year of war
in your “political perspective’ column,
however, in the same breath you call
Upon organisations and individuals
“to re-assese and come up with a con-
crete and effective plan of action to
break the chains in 1988 andreach the
goal ofa free Namibia’ Thus, l accept
that you areatthesametime wishing
for peace and war. This isa contradic.
tion I'l] never be able to understand.

Please keep in mind: Swapo opted for
war. Thisis what they got. The securi-
ty forces were in being long before the
existence of Swapo and if you look at
the alm of any defence force in the
ighey you will notice that their duty

smongat other thesafeguarding of
Ife, property and freedom.

1988 the security forcea will maintain
this aim!

May [ wish you not a worldly “hap.
py” festive season, but my prayers are
that you may also experience the love
of God towards mankind manifested
through the birth of Hie Son, our
Saviour and Lord, Jesus Christ, in
whom we trust to build the future of
this beautiful country with all ita

NOTE: Don't talk absolute rubbish,

better. An in-depth study and
research of the reporting in The
Namibian, and frequent, virtual
weekly reports of security force
atrocities (on your own admission)
should be telling you something.

You would prefer, obviously, that
because the Defence Force has
stated that “no atrocities by
members of the security forces wil]
be tolerated”, that we should not
report them at all. 1s this what you
define as “objectivity’? While on
the subject, perhaps youcouldtel}
us how many members of the
‘security’ forces appeared in court
for atrocities, and bow much, in
claims of compensation, has been
paid out by the military tomembers
of the civilian population in the
past year? We wonder whether you
even keep such statistics.

classify Swapo as “the enemy”, and

in this regard is entirely without
factual basis. .

The‘security’ forces in this coun-
try have not maintained the aim of
“safeguarding of life, property and

to talk about spreading the “love of

ALLOW me to express my heartfelt
disgust at Commandant G R C
Bester's childish, hopeless and self-
defeating comments which regularly
appear in this newspaper.

Asa patriotic and oppressed Nami-
bian citizen, I really feel compelled to
respond to Commandant ‘8
narrow-minded allegations against
the editor of this newspaper in par-
ticular and the entire oppreased but
fighting people of Namibia under the
leadership of Swapoa.

I would like to make it categorically
clear to Commandant Bester and his
masters in Pretoria that Swapo is the
people of Namibia and the people are
Swapo. If South Africa is trying to
destroy Swapa, then they must be try-
ing to destroy the the suffering Nami-
bian people. But the apartheid regime
will not succeed in destroying the peo
ple's movement. The apartheid govern.
ment has been trying to bring Swapo
to its knees for years, but all their ef-
forte were in vain

They haveeven tried to infiltrate the
organisation with spies, but none of
their dubious attempts have
succeeded.

Commandant Bester went on to ask
a foolish and shortsighted question
“Who opted for revolution?” The
answer is simple and clear: Swapo. But
the next question to which he should
provide us witha proper answer is why
Swapo resorted to armed liberation
struggle.

Swapo Secretary General, Andimba
Toivo ya Toivo made the movement's
position clear in the Sixties: ‘“Swapo
iteelf was a non-violent organisation,
but the South African government 18
not truly interested in whether oppose.
tion is violent or non-violent. It does
not-wish to hear any opposition to
apartheid”.

Furthermore, Swepo President Sam
Nujoma, made clear the position of
Gwapo with regard to the people's
revolution against colonial oppression
and exploitation at the WCC con-
ference in Lusaka last year. He said:.

“On the question of violence, we make
no apology for the fact that after acen-

military campaigns and unbridled
economic exploitation, our movement
had decided to take up arms to confront
colonial violence with armed self.
defence. It is enshrined in our move-
ment’s political programme that
Swapo does not glorify war. We wish
that nobody had ever forced ustohave
to fight a war of national liberation
But the reality of prolonged colonial
oppression in Namibia being what it
is. we have been left with no alter:
native but lo fight with armsin hand
for our liberty and right to self
determination and independence. To
those who would advise us not to fight
colonial oppreasion with arms in hand,
our answer is: ‘show us the available
non-violent means to Namibia’s in-
dependence and we shall follow’”’

The available peaceful means to
Namibian independence through UN
Resolution 435 has been deliberately
delayed by South Africa for ten years
Since 1981, the Swapo President has
expressed his genuine willingness to
sign a ceasefire with the South African
regime any where in the world but in
Windhoek or Pretoria. But what was
the response of South Africa? They said
it was ‘premature’ to sign a ceasefire
with Swapo.

On socalled ‘atrocities’ allegedly
committed by Swapo against the
civilian population of thia country, this
is wishful and baseless thinking onthe
part of the people who have failed to

tury of foreign oppression, genocidal

win the hearts and minds of the op-
pressed Namibians.

If Commandant Bester claims that
Swapo has no support, then does he
think the over 3000 people whoattend.
ed the recent Swapo public meeting in
Katutura were supporters of his
Government?

Commandant Bester cannot tell us
about the ways and means as to how
Namibians should achieve freedom
and national independence, since the
whole history of the Afrikaners in
South Africa and Namibia is written
in blood. How did they achieve their
gelf-determination from Britain?

Ithink it ishigh time Commandant
Bester stop writing rubbish to the peo-
plc's newspaper and should rather
send hie misleading and counter.
productive letters to the Koevoet
Koerant.

lappeal to the editor not to publish
any more of his letters, He hag access
toall necessary meansof propaganda
and should leave the-editor of this
newspaper and Dr A Shejavali of the
Council of Churches in peace.

I would like to close with the words
of ya Toivo, whosaidthat: “We believe
that South Africa hasa choice -either
to live at peace with usor tosubdue us
by force. If you choose to cruah us and
impoee your will on us then you not on-
ly betray your trust, but you will live
in security for only so long as your —
power is greater than ours. No South
Africa will live at peace in Namibia, for
each will know that hissecurity isbas- —
ed on force, and that without force he
will face rejection by the people of |
Namibia”. |

Not Swapo bomb

SWAPO has nothing to do with the
bomb blast at Oshakati.l am only one
of the many Namibians who will
neither agree nor accept racist South
Africa’s malicious propaganda cam-
paign against Swapoand the people of
Namibia. South Africa through its
puppets and mass media continue to
deceive and mislead Namibians as to
the true situation in our country.

I feel deeply hurt at the loss of lives
ofinnocent civilians at Oshakati. Itis
not the first time that the people of
Namibia are intimidated, harrassed
and killed by the racists of Pretoria.

Who was responsible? There are
many instances as examples, 1981
bomb blast at Oshakati Post Office, for-
tunately noinjuries; 1998 bomb blast
at Okatana service Station, killing two
Americans and a local businessman,
Mr Nakambonde; 1985 bomb blast at
Ondangwa Post Office, killing many
people including children; 1985 bomb

blast at the Ongwediva Training Cen-
tre, fortunately nocasualties; 1986 so-
meone tried to plant a bomb at Mr
Frans Indongo’s Continental Super-
market, fortunately he wascaught red-
handed and felt very ashamed; 1986
security forces tried to plant a bomb for
CDA President Peter Kalangula, but
this too failed.

Further still, there are many, many
Namibians who have either been kill-
ed or who disappeared, andl amciting
the following examples; Mathias
Ashipembe, David Sheehama,
Fillemon Elifas, Joseph Dumeni and
many others. These are merely some
examples of atrocities committed by
South Africa against the people of
Namibia, and for which Swapo gets the
blame.

Many Namibians do not have homes
or property any more, as these have
been destroyed by the racist’s Casspirs.
Swapo has never committed any such
act against the people ofthis country,
which we cannot say about South
Africa. Racist South Africa is to be
blamed for numerous atrocities
against Namibians, and I call upon the
international community to quickly
intervene. We, the people of Namibia
will continue to. call for your
withdrawal from our beloved land,
even if you rape, imprison, maim, kill
and destroy our property. We call upon
you, racist South Africa, to uncondi-
tionally withdraw your forces from
Namibia and to allow the implemen-

AS LONG as I live, I remain flab-
bergasted by the gravity of audacity,
courage and perseverance some people
are endowed with. These are the words
which slip into my mind whenever |
stop to muse over the kindof personali-
ty of our Bishop Kleopas Dumeni of
ELCIN.

To me the Bishop orchestrates a
typical leader, who, given a chance
wasted by fortune-seekers and
hypocritical politicians in thiscountry,
will or can lead Namibia into blossom-
ing tomorrows.

The Bishop's charisma goes beyond
spiritual confines. It isto me always a
blessing to listen to his sermons and
how I wish, always, he could be allot-
ted the Presidency.

The Bishop displayed metaphysical!
courage and boldness at the recent
mass funeral of victimsof the Oshakati
bank bomb massacre. In the face of a
gruesome and satanic horror which
struck numb the people of the north,
where innocent young lives, including
that of his own daughter, were put to
waste, he said his say and he said it
right and in a calm and unshaken
voice. ee

One really wonders atthecharisma
this man of God has, for, even ifdeath
struck his family a cataclysmic blow,
almost thrice in a row, he goes forth to
console his parishioners, when he
should himeelf sit and be consoled.

I was offended by the hypocritical
condolence from Louis Pienaar and de
Wet of Sector 10, who ironically pledg-
ed a police investigation and the ap-
prehension of culprits, forgetting that
_ they, including a confused Kozonguizi,
have already branded Swapo
nsible. :

didn’t the master of ceremony
at ‘Kandaha’ Dumeni’s funeral repeat
such soothing condolences from Sam
NujomaofSwaporather than wasting
time to read messages from those
nonentities? IfPienaar andde Wet can
heed Bishop Dumeni’s call on
February 27 and withdraw their South
African forces from Namibia and im-
plement UNSCR 436 this year, they
will be saved the energy of sending us
their unwanted condolences
emanating from deaths of such a
nature as on February 19.

I strongly believe in the message
from the Roman Catholic Church that
the Oshakati bomb massacre was a
devilish, rather than a divine will. If
that act was a Godly-premeditated
phenomenon, then God has betrayed
his own commandment ‘Thou shalt
not kill’, and has been in cahoots with
enemies to kill innocent souls in the
ban.

Although it is hard to understand,
probably one should follow Bishop
Dumeni’s words of encouragement not
to despair but to trust that the
Almighty will one day crush the teeth
of the enemy and rid Namibia of hor-
rendous deaths in bomb blasts. |

May the Bishop and other bereaved |
families be consoled. To the people of
Namibia, unity is strength against the
bloodstained hands of Pretoria.
Namibia will one day explode with
Kugnter a and peace and not with bomb
blasts.

IS IT possible to talk about church and
politics at the same time? Do the two
have anything in common? Can the
church mix with politica? Such ques.
tions and more similar questions are
struggled with in the context of
Namibia in particular. Such questions
are both theological and political. For-
tunately, theological and political
questions are asked by human beings
who are involved either.in the church
and/or politics in one way or another.

My aim here is to open up a
theological and political debate for
concerned people in a situation of apar-
theid, colonialism, racism, exploita-
tion and draconian laws such as those
of Namibia. I am stating only
preliminary remarks, sparing the rest
for contemplated responses.

The truth of the matter is that the
Church cannot claim its existence
without people Likewise politics can.
not be without people. It is the people
whoconstitute the church. it isthe peo-
ple who politicise. The basicconcernof |
the church is wider and broader than
its numerical] membership It is within
the framework of the Church's pro-
phetic call and public responsibility to
aspire for peace, justice, freedom,
respect of human rights and dignity to
all people irrespective of their stations
in life. On the other hand, the Church |
is not serving angels, but human be-
ings whoee basic needs-amongothers _
- include food, shelter, clothing and
security or safety. In essence, these

needs cannot be secured without some
‘t

"" forms of political and economic exer |

cine. In fet, even if the Church may
manage tochristianiseeachandevery |

permon on the globe (if that could be |
 pousible) political structures ‘end |
economic systema will be impers ve...

rotcry that “the church should not be
involved or mixed with politics”, as if
there isadivinecommand, especially |
given tocertain people, to be political-
ly involved. |

The irony of the issue is that most of
those whocry loudly that “the church
should or even must not mix with
politics’ are themselves members of
the Church - of whom some may well
sti] gotochurch on Sundays. The ques-
tion is: where do they hide their
mysterious political bodies and souls

when they go tochurch clothed in their
church body-souls?
_-""It should be known by both believers
and non-believers that the church pro-
claims the God who created the
universe including mother earth. Does
politics take place outside and beyond
this universe? If that is the cage, then
the Church would be wrong to be con-
cerned with political oppression and
injustices taking place outside God's
created cosmos. As far as we know,
politics is done not only on earth but
exercised by these God-created
creatures - human beings. Ontheother
hand, the language of the church
transcends this life to heaven as well.

If politics is touching the lives of
church members in Namibia, how can
it be, that the Church of God of justice
and love can be indifferent to suffering
and the selfish spirit of imperialism?
Ifthe Church’s mission before all else
is supernatural - preaching only
reward in heaven when onediesand let
misery andoppression inthis life pass — |
_qunabated-thennowondersometamp- |

tedtocall itthe “opium ofthe people’.
There is no way forthe Church toavoid
such accusations until the Church
takes up ite role of a conacience of a. con-
achuncelesa society: Neither the church
nor any one responsible person ts ex-
empted from the obligation to restat
cruelty, violence, colonialism, ex:
- ploitation of person by another person,

inconjunction with all concerned peo-
. (wherever they are) should join
hands to ceaselessly struggle so that
hu ""s lgnity and peace be rentored
onemt
‘hey ehowt, potltios is not foreign to |
In short, politics is not foreign to
members of the Church. To be a
member of the Church does not extract
any one person from being a human be-
ing with human needs. Therefore, the
Church as comprised of people cannot
be accused of mixing with politics un-
ti] a normal political atmosphere is
restored - when threat to human lives
and properties ceases and safety and
security, is guaranteed by a proper
judicial system and humane, accep-
table protection of human rights.

Again, these are just opening
remarks. I am expecting a response.
Especially from those who feel this is
& scandal both to their Christian or
otherwise understanding of the
Church and political analysis.
Remember also that we do not speak
about a theocratic state here since this

is not our vision in an independent
Namibia. I have deliberately scratch-
ed the surface. Let us ponder together
over this issue of church and politica in

Reply te Heywood
WE note the letter from Professor A
Heywood, published in your —
newspaper on May 20,1988,in which ©
she differs with certain statements
made in an advertisement which was
placed by NPP 435 in the Windhoek
Observer. We would like to respond to
the three major points which she has
raised in her letter:
1) On the question of whether or not
Resolution 435 provides for elections
under joint South African and United
Nations (UN) supervision: Prof
Heywood is quite correct in stating
that ‘‘Resolution 435 and the
documents surrounding it are reflec-
tions of historical reality”. Your cor-
respondent correctly points out that
Resolution 385 (which preceded
Resolution 435 by tlwo-and-a-half
years) declares that free elections be
held under supervision and control of
the UN. However, in order to give effect
to Resolution 385, the Western Five
negotiated a settlement plan for
Namibia with South Africa and
Swapo, which culminated in the
Western Proposal for Settlement
(Security Council Document 9/12636).

This Western proposal was
thereafter ratified by the United Na-
tions Security Council (UNSC) in its
Resolution 435 (1978) and as such
forms part of the resolution.

In Resolution 431 of July 27, 1978,
- the Security Council took note of the
Western Proposals, and requested the
Secretary-General to submit a report
containing his recommendations for
the implementation of. the Western
Proposals. Thusthe Western
were accepted by the UNSC in Resolu-
tion 431, In Security Council Docu-
ment 8/12827 of August 29, 1978, the
_ Secretary-Genera] made recommen-

dations, as requested in Res 431; later,
in an Explanatory Statement
(8/12869) of September 28, 1978, he ad- —
dressed and explained certain con-
cerns raised during consultations with
all the parties involved. Both of these
documents were approved in Res 435
of September 29, 1978, and the
Western Proposala were approved and
ratified as such by Rea 435 (1978).

It is clear fram the W

PY a

posals, although not explicitly stated, |
| thistth effect thé elections will bsheld .
ratified as such by Res 435 (1978).

It is clear from the Western Pro-
posals, although not explicitly stated,
that in effect the elections will be held
under the joint supervision and control
of South Africa and the UN: paragraph
4 states, “In carrying out his respon-
sibilities, the Special Representative
will work together with the offical ap-
pointed by South Africa (the
Administrator-General) toensure the
orderly transition to independence.

Paragraph 5 states: ‘‘... the United
_ Nations Special RepreZentative will

have to satisfy himself ai each stage as
_ tothe fairness and appropriateness of

al] measures affecting the political pro-
cess...’ and “... may himself make pro-
posals in regard to any aspect of the
political process.’

Furthermore, paragraph 6 states:
‘‘The implementation of the electoral
process, including the proper registra-
tion of voters and the proper and timely
tabulation and publication of voting
resulta, will also have to be conducted
to the satisfaction of the Special
Representative.”

In other words, the Special] Represen-
tative does not directly conduct the
electoral procees but has joint control,
through his proposed recommenda-
tions and supervisory role. This fact is
attested to by the Assistant Secretary-
General's Information Circular, dated
July 16, 1962, which confirms the ar-

for the implementation of
Reeolution 435 (1978). In paragraph 2,
under the heading ‘Informal Sum-
mary’, it isstated that: ‘‘Theelections
will. be undertaken by the South

Afeloan Administrator General and
his administration. Beth the
Advi niatrator-General th
Special Representative of the
Secretary-General will remain inthe
country until independence.”

2) On the question of whether the
Administrator-General appointed by
the South African Government will
administer the country: Prof Heywood
is quite correct in stating that Res 435
provides for ‘‘the withdrawal of South
Africa’s illegal administration from
Namibia and the transfer of power to
the people of Namibia, with the
assistance of the UN in accordance
with Res 385 (1976)’’ However, it
should be pointed out that Res 435
(1978) is a compromise plan designed
to remove South Africa’s illegal oc-
cupation in Namibia, with the co- |
operation of the South African
representative, the Administrator.
General, asa central feature tothe im-
plementation of theSettlement Plan. |

Tat. .4§2..2.. A. .
It is clear from the documentation
which is attendant upon Res 435 and
its accompanying resolutions, that the
Administrator-General and his
department will administer Namibia
during the transitional period, but
under conditions in which he will have
to repeal before the elections “all re-
maining discriminatory or restrictive
laws, regulations and administrative
measures’, which may inhibit the
holding of free and fair elections
(paragraph 7A of Western Proposals).
The arrangements for the release of all
political prisoners will also be the
responsibility of the Administrator-
General (paragraph 7B of Western Pro-
posals). These and al] other necesgary
procedures to attain the object of free
and fair elections, will be overseen by,
ratified by, the UN Special Represen-
tative with the assistance of the
civilian component of UNTAG.

On the question of whether the
South African Police/SWA Police will
maintain law and order during the
transitional! period: It should be noted
that the United Nations Transitional
Assistance Group (UNTAG) is not in-
tended to be a police force. Thisisclear
ifreference is made to paragraph 9 of
the Western Proposals which state,
‘Primary responsibility for maintain-
ing law and order in Namibia shall rest
with the existing police forces.” This
Proposal was accepted by the
Secretary-General in his Explanatory
Statement which outlined the Special
Representative’s explicit respon-
sibilities to oversee the existing police
forces. In thisregard, animportant role
of the Special Representative, assisted
by thecivilian component of UNTAG,
will be to take measures against in-
timidation or interference with the
electoral process, to accompany the ex: |
ating police force and to ensure the
good conduct of these forces (paragraph
29 of the Secretary-General’s report
Document 8/12827 and the Ex-
panatory Statement S/12869).
Earlier, the Western Proposal had
stated that the exiating police force
would be limited to “the carrying of
emal! arms inthe normal performance
of their duties” - acondition tobe over-
seen by the UNTAG civilian/police
component (paragraph 9, Western
Proposals).

lam very worried about the colonial
behaviour of some of the so-called
tribal chiefs in Owambo known as
Gabriel Kautwima and Mr Gottlieb
Dan. These two men are some of the
leaders of the colonial organisation
known as ‘“‘Etango”’ inOwambo. They
are still refusing the removal of the
racist military-base at Ponhofi Secon-

dary School which caused the the loss

of many lives in the surrounding areas.
especially of the Ponhofi-students.
They are ncw encouraged by the
Administrator-General, Louis
Pienaar, who hasrecently announced
that the military base at Ponhofi will
not be removed.

Please you two chiefs, are you 80
blinded by P W Botha that youcan't see
how your nation is suffering under the
Botha-regime who is using you as his
protectors? Do you know who Mr Louis
Pienaar is? Do you know who he
represents here? He is not and wil
never represent the Namibian people!
He is there for the benefit of the racist
South Africa, to protect and promote
the crucial laws and policies of South
Africa.

Louis Pienaar has nothing todo with
the demands of the majority of the
Namibian people.

You, Kautwima and Dan have recent-
ly said that your lives are worth more
than those hundreds of young suffer-
ing Namibian students. This only
shows that you lack patriotic feelings
and instead represent the racist-
Botha-government.

It seems as if you are not far from tak-
ing an oath of allegiance in the South
African Government, like Mr. Moses
Katjiongua have done, who is ignoring
his own people and instead protecting
South Africa’s racist policies and laws.

The Namibian people are demanding
peace, justice, self-detemination and
independence brought by the im-
plementation of Resolution 435. ] am
challenging you to personally attend
a Swapo-rally one day, to see how the
majority of the Namibian people ex-
press their willingness for the in-
dependence brought about by Swapo

| (Katjiua, ‘Rukoro; Makari, Zauana,
Keramata, Tjimune and Siririka):

Iwould like to reply to your long letter
which appeared in The Namibian of
July 15 in which you shameleasly
revealed your anti-Swapo sentiments
(or fears of Swapo).

lam responding to your letter in my
capacity asaSwapo member andlam
in no way stating Swapo's policy on
political rivals, however, I believe that
the overwhelming majority of Swapo
supporters would agree with me.

' No doubt you belong to the ethnic
party which is trying to unfairly be
called an equal of Swapo inthe libera-
tion struggle. I myself, initially, and
until very recently, wrongly believed
that Swapo should join hands with
what is referred to(sometimes wrong:
ly) progressive groupings against the
common enemy.

But after your letter and your party
Secretary General’s(properly termed)
‘thinly-veiled attack on Swapo' at
Okahandja, I have changed my mind
and suggest that this idea be
relinquished.

You mentioned in your letter that

and serve the interests of the rival
groups which failed to get political sup-
port in the national! political market.
If you want competition with Swapo,
the movement is not worricd by that,
and will not participate in the competi-
tion because it is too busy with the
struggle for independence at this
critical stage. You have plenty of time
todo that, I guess. However your com-
petition will only be meaningful ifyou
join hands with South Africa and its
allies, but Swapo is determined to fight
South Africa and its allies at all costs.
You give the impression that you agree
with Mr P W Botha whosaid he would
not tolerate a Swapo government in
Windhoek. But I must remind you that
a Swapo government is inevitable
despite this remark by the South
African State President, because he is
in no position to prevent this and
neither are you. Would you opt for ban-
ditry (Unita style)? I would leave this
patriotic question to you and your
conscience. |
In conclusion I would like to refer you
to what Mr Emib.Appolus had to say

Costs of 435

WHAT many Namibians have warned
against for many years has now come
to pass. As soon as the South African
Government tells us of ‘agreement’
with regard toimplementation of 435,
we are informed that it will cost
billionsand the UN must now look for
the money.

For years, all UN resolutions aimed
at preserving the natural wealth of our
country, have been ignored by South
Africa and all those nations exploiting
our natural resources. South African
occupation of Namibia costs millions
aday but no money is available for the
implementation of the peace plan.
Salaries of South Africa’s proxies in
Namibia have been increased time and
again and for that, money was

available. And in all this, Namibians
had no say, they only paid taxes.

While we are not overexcited at this
point that the agenda for implementa-
tion will follow the time schedule that
was indicated by the SA Foreign
Minister, the time has come for Nami-
bians to state their position with
regard to who will foot the bill Surely
we cannot accept that our country has
become a poor and underdeveloped and
dependent country all of a sudden
Therefore we would like to make some
suggestions to the UN Secretary
General who will now be presented
with the bill

Asa people whohave remained self-
rehant through the ages, we would not
hke to become international beggars
at this point and would like to con
tribute towards the costs of implemen.

ponder

Namubia still has some resources
therefore we propose that an indepen.
dent commission be established 1m.
mediately with complete insight into
all transactions involving monies leav-
ing this country, with immediate
effect,
© that all expert of Namibian natural
resources be monitored by the UN and
all resources accruing therefore, be put
in a fund towards paying for
implementation;
= that with immediate effect, all
monies collected through sales tax be
paid into the abovementioned fund;
C that the exhorbitant salaries paid
to SA proxies in Namibia be im-
mediately stopped and that money be

put in the abovementioned
all know that the AG andthe BA
civil service runs Namibia acti they
should receive salaries from the col-
onia] power according to international
practice;
O that all these companies which, ec-
cording to the Thirion Report, have
been sending out natural resources il-
legally, or have paid leas taxes than
they should have, be compelled to pay
the said amounts in the implementa.
tion fund;
that alltaxes paid by Namibiansin
order to fund second tier authorities,
be channelled into the said fund.

Since the people of this country have
never had a say in whathappenstothe
funds collected through the means
above, they should do eo now. The six
pointa mentioned above are only
pointers. We realise there should be
some control and therefore suggest
that all those parties which have been
in favour of the implementation of 435
now form a watchdog committee and
take this 1asue up immediately. All
Namibians know that thesaid parties
are constituent members of the /Ai-
Gams group

you to take up this challenge.

My dear Namibiana, do you know
that there are seven chief human
wants in life? Theee are: air tobreathe,
water to drink and for domestic pur-
poses adequate, wholesome and
norishing food; Landon which to build
our houses; sufficient clothing to keep
us warm and enable us to conform with
accepted standards of decency; fire or
fuel to enable us to cook our food; and
a shelter to protect us from the sun,
wind and rain

Ifthe Namibian nation is deprived
of these needs by s certain greedy
group of people; that greedy group errs
against God's will and against the
whole of humanity. Sa, no government
(nobody) has right to keep away these
natural wants from any individual
Because the youth of today is the future
generation, I think it is of paramount
importance for the youth of Namibia
to watch critically and see if there is
any violation of these wanta If there
16 a violation, what is the necessary
resistance our youth need to render? If
our air is being polluted, I feel it isthe
responsibility of our youth to take an
active stand in order to protest that
evil If few people have sufficient food
and water while many people have not,

to analyse the root cause of such evil

Because the land of Namibia isnot yet

money from exploiting us. In order to
live a proper life, we need the land and
this remains the greatest task of the
youth of Namibia to struggle and
regainourland We, therefore, cannot
be a nation if we have no land

History can prove that the struggle
in Namibia isover the land inthe first
place and allother things like human
rightaetc come second The struggle
waged by our political forefathers such
as Witbooi, Mandume, Mahareroand
many others, was the struggle for our

they loat because they were not united,
but they are not defeated for we are
here to continue their resistance - on-
ly ifare united. Naturally, politically
and economically, Namibia is our land
and we want it back now.

Dear comrades and friends, freedom
1s what we desire - itis our destination.

conscription, corruptive education,

My beloved youth of Namibia, doyou
ayree with me that the struggle is over
the land in the first place? The im-
perialist governments are not in-
terested in Namibia because love
the Namibians They certainly donot
love us but they just fell deeply in love
with the land Namibia because she is
very rich. Now they are raping our
motherland. America, Britain, West
Germany and many other European
countries are more interested in
mineral resources our land produces
and not inthe Namibian people.

The South African soldiers and police
killed many Namibians because of the
land not because Namibianscommit-
ted any sin. The youth must be aware
of this fact that they must struggle, not
for a slice of bread or a loafofbread, but
for the whole bakehouse. We must free
the whole land of Namibia. All evil
powers of colonialiem and neo-
colonialism must be resisted. Col-
oniatiam is violance - oppression is
violence neo-colonialism is bribery or

betrayal which is aleo violence and alt,
these must be resisted. To revolt

Namubians, stand up and fight for your
rights - your country is your rights.

Letusbe vigilant and not be confus-
ed by what Icall “rumours of peace”
and stop the genuine process of the
struggle for freedom. Some of us may
say: let us stop a bit and see what will
happen. I say no, bece use to stop “a bit”
while there is nothing really achieved
is like putting a horse behind the cart.
Let us continue the struggle until all
our dreams and visions become a reali-
ty -a free united Namibia.

This struggte needs a young person's
prayer, mind, brain, energy, blood, tear
drop, and courage in order to achieve
freedom in totality. Thank you com-
rade H. Ya Toivo; you have spoken the

truth ty warning the youth of Namibia
that the “struggle is long and bitter”.
Thank you, certainly, Namibta has ber

at least six Casspirs allegedly ap-

vicinity. Mrs Lucia Muleka (66), wife
of later deceased Neghipityoova at
Oshandi, was on her way to fetch water
from a nearby well when one of those
Casspirs ran over her.

Without telling anybody, they
(Koevoet)picked her up and put her in
their vehicle then they drove back.

westwards of the village. When the
family of Mrs Muleka waited forsome
information of whereabout their per-
son, they did not hear anything about
her until on 26.7.88. On Wed nesday,
27.7.88, the family members started
Inquiring about her in all hospitals
and later suddenly thdy found hercor-

tury. Nu more information had been

The same had happened when on
‘Sunday 24.7.88 at 17h15(5h15)seven
Casspirs(wolf)and one Buffelalleged”

neighbouring village of Oshandi. They
came to certain cuca-shops inquiring
on the whereabouts of two plan com.

in the same area. When those who
were shopping at those cuca-shops
answered that they did not see those
men, the Koevoet men started beating
people with butts and fists, kicking
everyone who was shopping; and it
didn’t matter ifit wasa very aged man
or woman.

Among those badly injured were
Miss Maria Hamutenya (22) who was
told to lie down on the floor and beat-

ALLOW me tocomment on the letter
which appeared in The Namibian of
August 05, under the heading
“Pallacious’ written by VT Kavari.

I've been present al the Nanso con-
gresses since 1986 (second congress) up
to this year with the fourth congress.
where I’ve experienced a spirit of
brotherhood,

What I have observed is that after @
speaker has delivered a speech, oppor-
tunity was given to the house for
discussion, questions, correction, ad-
dition, clarification, comment, etc.

I believe this was done so that with
the departure of the congress no com:
rades could go to their respective
places with unsolved problems asitap-
pears to be In your case.

I'm just wondering whether you
never got the opportunity to air your
views and to go personally tothe NEC
Members, instead of doing it in the
newspapers and to create a tasteless
spirit among the students, which is
totally unnecessary.

If you were at the congress you will
remember that comrade Shihwamen!
was the last person to clarify on this
issue. |

He explained that people have to
make the difference between a pro-
gressive party and a liberation move-
ment. He went on saying that pro-
gressive parties are mostly concerned
with ethnic issues, while Swapo which
isa liberation movement, is aimed at
liberating all the peace loving people
in Namibia irrespective of their col-
ours, ethnic groups, etc.

This is a fact that we, in Namibia
have to accept that Swapo is the only,
only armed movement that is fighting
(unless, as Shihwameni said, ""there is
another armed movement that is
hiding underground”)

- What comrade Steve saidat thecon-
on this issue was positive and I,
with the majority accepted it, although

A LOT of confusion is deliberately be-
ing created about Resolution 435. The
only way to demystify the said Resolu-
tion is to publish Resolution 435, the
Contact Group's plan for Namibia and
other wie e documents for all

and sundry { | what is being

- The honourable Administrator
General is adding to the confusion by
repeating issues that were long since
dealt with. Are his pronouncements
aimed at shipwrecking the present
negotiations, or are they an indication
of South Africa's unwilling participa-
tion in the talks?

The question of the socalled ‘UN par.
tiality’ was addressed to the satisfac-
tion of the SA Government from 1978
to 1982. South Africa was satisfied to
such an extent that at one pointthe SA
Minister of Foreign Affaira went on
record saying the ‘Cuban issue” was
the only obstacle to the implementa.
tion of Resolution 435.

It is however, important to state that
it is not only the UN that must be 1m-
partial. The same impartiality 18 ex.
pected from the office of the Ad.
ministrator General. Both the Special
Representative of the UN's Secretary
General and the SA representative -1n
terms of435-are meant toobserve im.
partiality during the implementation
of 435.

It is thus questionable:
} for a South African Government
representative to tell Namibians who
their enemy is, thus pushing them to
unite Isitto safeguard South African
snteresta? Would anybody who claims
to be a true Namibian really want to
be directed by a South African Govern-
ment official in his aspirations? This
ig ample proof that the AG really can-
not lay claim to impartiality.
C) what about South Afri ca’s support
for the socalled internal-parties,
moral and material? Wil that stopor

SWABC radio and television, by the
Post Office? What steps is South Africa
taking in respect of this? We cannot
forget the non-availability of ©
te andtelexes for the Patriotic
Front at the time of elections in 1980.

The double talk: peace and in-

“THERE is another sfde tothe story of I-
the socalled “Ten years of peace in East
Caprivi’ (The Windhoek Advertiser,
August 26). It has not had ten years of
peace as Brigadier Gert Nel suggests:
it HAS been ten years of humiliation
and intimidation.

Iregard this report as an attempt to
invalidate the very succeasful Swapo
rally held in the region on August 20,
as well as to discredit Caprivians in the
eyes of fellow Namibians. Brigadier
Nel’s long report on the socalled ‘peace’
is mere propaganda.

Leaders have been intimidated and
harassed by the SADF and its counter-
part, Swapol, formerly SAP. The socall-
ed ‘leaders’, as claimed by Brigadier
Nel, are instruments used to further
the prevailing status quo. The tradi-
tional leaders are merely the
equivalents of the Katjiuonguas and
Matyilas of Namibia.

As regards what Brigadier Nel calls
‘cooperation’ between the army and
civilians, I have the following to say:

* intense psychological war is at work
in the region; :
* the people do not admire the SADF
or SWATYF, because it is not their army,
but South Africa's, The civilians may
‘cooperate’ with the army because they
need to survive; but it is not out of their
own will. Their fear is legitimate.

The bitter irony behind the creation
of 701 Battalion is that most young
men have joined the army as a last
resort. The rate of unemployment in
Caprivi is so high that people are left [
with two major options: to join the ar-
my, undesirable as that is, or become
a teacher. |

The SADF and Swapol have repress-
ed any sign of protest so that may give
an illusion of ‘peace’ in the region.

Regarding Enok/FNDC, this com-
pany may be credited with
monopolistic and exploitative prac-
tices in the region. It is notorious for
paying low wages; and they are cer-
tainly not contributing to any develop-
ment worth mentioning. |

The SWABC is nothing other thana
mouth piece of the interim government
and ita masters in Pretoria. It is also
used to disseminate the kind of pro-
paganda which Brigadier Nel

report, pupils were disappointed at my
actions. Those were not my actions.
But I was very much disappointed at
the behaviour of my pupils, because
they did not ask the “foreign” pupils
not to use abusive language towards
me.

I did not and do not deserve that [

my shock and surprise, “foreign”
pupils took the fire brigade hospipers
chased me away with water and stones.
Even my pupils who participated in
these actions did not even try to stop
the others from doing it.

The police are on patrol all over
Katutura and more especially around
our school because you made it a soft
target in order to either discredit me
or to put members of my staff under
Scrutiny, and they can see for
themselves what is going on at the
school. Why don't you give al} schools
as tough a time as you do with us: why
do you concentrate on two or three
schools only? Do you have some
motives or are you bribed to discredit
some schools? |

As president of NAMTA (Namibia —
Teachers Association), I want to
reiterate my organization's point viz.
that we do have understanding with

- most demands, but we can't condone
endless boycotts. We admire those who
continue with it but salute the others
who want to continue their studies.

Tocometothese ‘foreign’ pupilson

and again toharass us. Those who say
] gave away thechildren have toreason
realistically because] readthenames _
of my school pupils, and those who re-

_ mained were not of my school. And how
can these “foreign” pupils expect me |
to “protect” them when they gave me _
such rough treatment by shouting me. |
“down”, by wetting me, throwing —

WE FACE an enemy that is deep-
rooted, an enemy entrenched and
determined not to yield. Our march to
freedom is long and difficult, but both
within and beyond our borders the pro-
| spects of victory grows bright.

The first condition for victory is

black unity. Every effort to divide

blacks must be vigorously repulsed.
Our people must be united into a
single, massive and solid wall of
resistance of united mass action. This
isnot the time for the luxury of disuni-
ty, we must close ranks at alllevels, and
differences must be submerged to the
achievement of a single goal which is
the complete overthrow of apartheid
and racist domination.

The revulsion of the world against

apartheidis growing.. The world ison
our side, the OAU, the UN andthe anti-
apartheid movement continue to put
pressure on the racist and colonial
rulers of our country. Every effort to
isolate South Africa adds strength to
our stuggle. At all levels much has
been achieved and much remains tobe
done, but victory is certain.

We must look beneath the veil of con-
stitutional formulas and deceptive
phrases to see the face of apartheid, the
rattling of gunfire and the rumbling of
Hippo armoured vehicles

South Africa, Angola, Mjzambique,
Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Lesotho
still have to shed blood to defeat the last
bastion of oppression and blistering in-
ferno of racial hatred.

acknowledgement of the Rai that
Swapo is the leader of the liberation
movement, let alone being the only
liberation movement. Kavari, in fact
should show cause why Nanso must
not acknowledge Swapo leadershipof
the national liberationstruggle. I feel
strongly thattoaccept the unavoidable
reality that Swapo leads the nation
liberation struggle does not make us
politically affiliated to Swapo.

What is surprising for Kavari's let-
ter and all others who seem to be con-
cerned with Nanso’s secalled pro-
Swapo stand, isthat noneofthem men-
tioned the current crisis in education.
An impression is given that Nanso’s
recognition that Swapo leads the
liberation struggle is more evil and
criminal than the current crisis in
education. Meetings after meetings
are called and proposed not to address
the crisis, but Nanso. Nanso now has
become the crisis. Kavari talks of
another national student movement
as a possibility, simply because Nan-
so has recognized Swapo leadership of
our struggle. IfNanso had recognized
or named the HNP as a progressive
party, than one would understand and
conceptualize the cry of Kavari et al.
If Nanso had failed to address the cur-
rent crisis properly and Kavari et al
talk of another student movement
which shall address the crisis in a bet-
ter way, one would understand their
cry. But thecry issimply because Nan-
so says Swapo leadsour nation at war

We are intimidated by the SA.
regime with its apartheid laws and
military atrocities. It is preaching its
“goodness” to win the hearts and
minds of the people, but we suffered for
a long time under its colonial regime.
It is still continuing to minimize our
political rights - how will we continue
with talks?

Cubans were willing to help Angola
from the intimidation we experiencing
here and their presence in Angola is
legal. As long as the intimidation to
the Namibian people continues
Angola cannot be saved.

Those who are threatened by the
presence of Cubans in Angola are the
“Terreblanche group’ of the South
African regime, who want to exploit
the Angolan people and its allies. Once
the Cubans withdraw from Angola the
‘Terreblanche speech” in the past few
days will be manifested practically.

The Namibian people welcome the
Cubans, because they are comrades -
they don't kill, but save. We have ex-
perienced SA (not Cuban) atrocities;
and the Angolans too.

FIRSTLY, we the people of Namibia
declare for all our country and the
world to know that Namibia belongs
to all who live in it, black and white.

The main demands are: the people
shall govern; all national groups have
equal rights and should unite; the land
shall be shared among those who work
for it; all shall be equal before the law;
all shall enjoy equal human rights;
there shall be work and security; the
doors of learning and culture shall be
opened; there shall be houses, securi-

No to homelands

THE tnbalisis who are trying to
divide this country into homelands
must be made to remember that our
nation cannot tolerate such divisions
in Namibia. The land is one, and the

e are one. Our nation must stand
firm in unity to fight against all forms
of divisions and homelands in the

mous for the rest of |

country. Things like the socalled
Republic of Rehoboth and Caprivi
cannot be tolerated in the would-be
independent Namibia.

_ Those who are involved in organi-
sing such things must repentand give
up such reactionary ideas immedi-
ately. This country is one, from the
Angolan border to the Orange River,
and from the Zambian border to the
Auantic Ocean.

We find it disturbing that we still
have bramwashed Afncan (Namib-
ian) intellectuals who believe in
homelands and tibalism when we
have our heroes who have died for
the freedom of Namibia as a whole.
] sust wonder from which books these
people have gathered such mislcad-
ing information.

These people should know that itis
utterly irresponsible and a marked
betrayal of those who died fighting
for the independence of Namibia as
well as the masses in this counuy.
Those people should also know that
their actions are a sign of mental
subjugation, and what I would call
the disease, requires an antidote.
Luckily, unlike Aids, an antidote is
available. People involved in declar-
ing homelands in Namibia must take
the undistorted history books and
read. perhaps this will make they
realise that they owe apologies to
faithful Namibians.

I appeal to our brothers and sisters
in Rehoboth and Caprivi not to sup-
port the people trying to lead them
into total nco-colonialism. All Na-
mibians must have the freedom to
live where they want to; and not be
confined to certain regions.

Swapo has been fighting to rid use
of the colonial yoke of South Africa
and the movement accepts all patri-
otic Namibians who want to be free.
Swapo condemns tibalism, region-
alism, sexism, racism and above all,
colonialism. The people of Namibia
should be vigilant because the pup-
pets trying lo impose homelands upon
them are creating civil war condi-
tions so that there is no peace in a free
Namibia. Our enemies are cncourag-
ing these puppets to create confusion
and antagonism among the people of

ein a freo Namibia.
Namibians should live in peace

gation.

The reality is this: rape is a
capital offence, and all reported

160 cases were reported, of which
94 were brought to tial, In 1987

the Untag component has to be

they are the ones which attacked

the ones who don't want the Pal-

If they want to reduce the number
of Untag troops, then they must

change Resolution 435, because: —

Resolution 435 says that 7500
Untag troops will arrive in’ Na-

Resolution 435 does not stipulate
that the Angolan Government must
negotiate with Unita; and in Reso-

that Untag troops must be com-

If they wantto contradict Reso-

‘A sensitive nerve

Indeed Mr Shipanga's ‘New Year's
Message’ touched a sensitive nerve
in me, especially with the untruths
and political dishonesty that ‘mes-
sage’ displayed.

In his articke (27/01/89) Mr Shipanga
implies that because Father Wolfe
had said that ‘‘reconciliation of the
Namibian people as a whole is needed
before we can become one Namibia
one Nation”’, then anybody who uses
the word ‘reconciliation’ on televi-
sion must go unchecked. Mr Shipanga,
reconciliation is not merely an event
- it is a process in which not only
what we say, but also whal we do,
will determine the essence of our
determination.
~ So do not think that people will
believe your sincerity because you
use the words ‘peace’ and ‘reconcili-
ation’, even more so when your frame
of reference is artificial: (that your
TGNU protected the rights of Na-
mibians during the past. three-and-a-
half years).

| maintain, Mr Shipanga, that your
Cabinet sided with the South Afncan
‘government in trying to stop duc
legal process, and I add that all this
was done at the expense of the tax-
payers. Please say this is not true, and
tel] the Namibian people what posi-
tion did you take, and what you as
Cabinet did in the interest of duc

logal process in the iste Wapota and

 «*Shifidi cases.

{also maintain that national cam-
paigns and international diplomatic
ence.
_ a) National campaigns:

- When the churches marched on

the side of the poor (Corpus Christ)
gangs from some governmentcircles
could not stop them. When Kamecta
gave that emotional address at St
Andrews in Khomasdal, the people
were moved to action, and more
Koevoet was armed and deployed on
the strects of Katutura

- When Swapo held a public rally
after five years of silence, fifteen
thousand people came. Apartheid
shivered in Namibia and police and
army tactics were adjusted as cvident
in the circumstances surrounding the
death of Shifidi.

- When concerned namibrans as-
sisted workers to bind together in
defence of their rights, their lives, -
an action which culminated in the
organised workers movement, sec- 7
ond to none in the history of Namibia |

“your C Cabinet moved in with bills to

‘that noble | vant a death
+, and th Sper yes, national
7, alinNe-
pia refused vo sign that bill into
law, and it was thus stillborn, re-
member? Remember the ILO experi-
ence when your cabinet was trying to
lobby against the Namibian workers
for fear of ‘poliucal manipulation’?
All your actions did not succeed be-
cause the workers were alwaysastep
ahead of your cabinet.

Mr Shipanga, if this is not ‘na-
tional campaigns’, what is?

(b) International campaigns:

Well, in the interest of space I shall
not dwell, because after all itis obvi
OUS:

- that itis because of intemational
diplomatic and economic pressure

on the government in South Africa
that your TGNU was not recognised
by a single country as such.

- that the South Afncan Rand has
and continues to plunge, to the extent
thal (as you correcuy pomt out) South
Africa had to recognise that itcannot
continue to enforce her preferences
through intermedianes of her unilat-
eral choice; and that the cost of re-
taining control has come to, and in
fact has long exceeded, the benefit.

It is in this Context interesting to
note what South African Minister of
Finance, Barend du Plessis, said ina
recent interview in Leadership (a South
African joumal),

Mr du Plessis was asked aquestion
on sanctions and he said: (paraphrased)
the question of sanctions is rather
delicate to discuss because, if you
say they are not working, you are
inviting more; and if you say they are
working, you are inviting more.

This J think is indicative of inter-

ment in camera. But I do know that
| ‘Newniblans; home and: abroad, dagws
been calling for political and eco-
nomic pressure on South Africa, and
I know that such pressure has come
about.

Finally I am surprised that Mr
Shipanga only now sees it fittoinvite
me to join hands with other Namibi-
ans to build the sort of country of
which we can all be proud, while he
knows that it was my commitment
all along. .

Mr Shipanga knows that when he
and his cabinet were campaigning
for ‘alternative’ models for Namibia's
independence because ‘UNSC Reso-
luuon 435 was dead’ I was among
those who were calling for the imme-
diate implementation of 435.

Mr Shipanga knows that during
his cabinet's marnage to South Af-
rica for the past three and a half
years, when our people were maimed
by his Koevoet, 1 was among those
who mobilised resources to defend
these victims. He knows that I was
one of those who mobilised resources
| wo defend the victims of arbitrary de-
|} tentions.

Now Mr Shipanga pretends that

THIS letter follows one by Mr
Vezera Kandetu (The Namibian
January 14 1989) and to the reply by
Mr Andreas Shipanga. | was going to
shat my mouth al this ume, and merely
hope that the future would bring me
and fellow Namibians the best.

When Shipanga joined the TGNU
he knew very well that they would be
Tesponsible to the Government of
South Africa, and he chose to fight
for freedom, liberty and self-deter-
minabon with the South African
Government, with Botha ‘leading the
tevolution’ and the Administrator
General as the man in charge of the
socalled ‘defenders’ of the nghts of
Namubians.

What does Shipanga mean when
he says ‘It is just this sort of hubns
which has hampered the struggle for
truc liberation in Namibia for so tong
and encouraged the armchair revolu-
Uonaries to waste their words and
deeds on irrelevancies’.

To tell the truth, Shipenga is one of
those who hampered the struggle for
trus liberation if he remembers what
he did in 1978: he divided the free-
dom fighters. And the description in
question fis him very well. Let me
say, he hes been an annchair revolu-
Uonary who has been wasting his

colleagues made the South African
Government realise that they could
not enforce its rule through Namib-
ian intermedianes, and so they went
to the negotiating table.

The TGNU never had the power to
decide, and the South Afncan Gov-
emment got what it wanted from the
intenm government.

Swapo would like united people as
itis their mou to unite the Namibian
people. But how can it succeed in
uniting the people if there are those
like yourself who are always divid-
ing the nauon. Swapo will unite and
join hands with fellow Namibians in
order to build up the nation you dis-
appointed, and the beloved land you
betrayed.

On the quesuon of your call on
Swapo to release the detainces it is
holding, that is none of your busi-
ness. After all, some of these things
are already provided for in accor-
dance with UNSCR 435 (1978) and
629 (1989), and all dates and events
are based upon the Annex to the
seiuement Proposal $/12636 of Apni
10 1978, just in case the South Afri-
can Government hasn't bnefed you.

Why didn’t the intenm govern-

¢cigner was transferred from the
workshop to another work area
Only after the stasement on Rossing

discriminatory practices appeared
in The Namibian (10/02/89)? Why
was the position frozen and not
filled with a Namibian? Is Rossing
preaching more than pracusing
their so-called Namibianisation
programme and only using it as
propaganda?

These, and other questions, when
answered, will prove that al
Rossing not all is praise.

Solidarity with fast

WE, the Justice and Peace
Commission of Windhoek Vicari-
ate, wish to express Our compas-
sion and solidarity with those
political detainees who are held
without trial and are fasting for
social and the transforma-
tlon of South African society.

We therefore, call upon the
South African Govemment to

release them immediately and
unconditionally or charge them
in a court of law.

It is appropristeduring this
present time of Lent that all Chris-
tians offer up their fasting acts of
self-denial to protest against in-
justices that are perpetrated by
the SA Government through the
racial policy of apartheid.

Wealsc call upon governments
worldwide, and the international
community to use their influence
in calling ceaselessly for the
unconditional release of the po-
liucal detainees and toensure that
a just political dispensation is
formulated in South Africa.

Lost manhood

A WORD or two to all Namibi-
ans, black and white, who want
democracy and peace in this
country.

To a large extent the evil-doers
have succeeded in producing, at
the output end of their machine, a
kind of black man who is man
only in form. This is the extent to
which the process of dehumanisa-
uon has advanced. The type of
black man we have today has lost
his manhood. In the privacy of
his ‘pondok’ his face twists in
silent condemnation of white
society, but brightens up in sheep-
ish obedience as he comes out
hurrying in response to his mas-
ter’s impatient call. Sometimes
he joins the chorus that roundly
condemns the white mastors, but

IN THEE hast edition of The Namib-

the eppertanity to reed what some
sembers of the SADF were saying
about commmnina. Before I say
anything about the subject, I would
like to mfonm readers that | was born
and brought up im the communist
state of Yugosiavia. I might add that
while living and working im ary home
town I had always refused offers to
become a member of the Communist
Party.

According © what these army
members say, which can also be taken
as the general opmion of Namibian
whites, particularly farmers, com-
munism means dictatorship which
includes the alling pf poliucal oppo-

Many of them regard anyone who
opposes the apartheid system and
white mmonty rule as a communist
or even, terrorist. I belseve that these
that this socio-political system in
which we live, or have been forced to
live, 1s one of the best. One thing is
sure, it is some kind of capitalism.

It is as unwise to say: Chnstianity
is better than Islam or the other way
around, as it is to say or think that
capitalism is better than communism
Or vice versa.

Of course any socio-polincal struc-
ture benefits someone profitably. If
we compare communismos and capt-
talismos, let's say according to the
number of private-owned cars and
television seis, we will have the
impression that capitalism is much
better. But if you look at other things
m the capitalist society, hike the number
of suicides, drug addicts, kidnap-
pings and terrorist attacks, then we
have another picture. It seems to me
that people in the capitalist world are
not so free and happy. Life under
communism is safer and better.

We must also not fail to give atten-
tion to job security in communist
states where itis very difficult to fire
workers from their jobs. Here in
Namibia the firing of workers is

‘normal procedure"".

If we wantto learn the facts we will
notice that communism by itself is
not some kind of poverty-maker. In
many communist-ruled states, living
standards are much higher than in
non-communist states; take for ox-
ample Latin America or the Phillipi-
1 nes, None of them are ruled by the

body in the USSR today has enough |

thal even in the most communist —
states, citizens enjoy more democ-
racy, more freedom and more justice
than the majonty here in Namibia.
The waves of protest in the commu-
nist countnies today, like the one in
Poland, is not directed against the |
communist system itself. The Soli- |
danity Union in Poland is not an anu-
communist movernent, which is trying
to destroy the Polish socio-political
structure. In fact, the union leaders
are better communists than ther rulers.

To many of those who so strongly
criacise the communist way of life,
communism and marxism mean the |
same thing, which is also wrong.
Somebody can be communist and |
not marxist; he can be Stalinist, Maoist |
etc. :
I myself do not adhere to any ide-
ology. I concern myself as a Chns- |
tian only, but to be a good believer
and Chrisuian does not mean to be
ready to kil] communists and non-
believers.

Rather it is to mean to work to-
gether and work in peace and har- |
mony. If we are not prepared to do
this, our future is bleak. To try to |
bring people to your side by creating |
a fear of the unknown is primitive
and cheap propaganda, which as such
is not a part of Western civilisation
which the SADF claims to defend.

An open letter to

Mr Dirk Mudge

TO inwoduce myself, I am ¢
“Boartge’. bor in the south of Namibia
where the majority of super-duper

Mr Mudge, is what the people say,
true: namely, thal you as the crown
prince of the SWA National Party's
apertheid regime at che time of the
Tamhalle, was called upon by Preto-
Tia to form the super-aparthcid-alli-
ance, called the DTA, and then to do
away with petty apartheid so as to
prevent a total o1] embargo on South
Africa; then to form your all-white
perty, called the Republican Party?
(At that time all this was done in the
interest of South Africa). The people
say that you served Pretoria well -
ther wish was (and is) your com.
mand. They say thal, at the ume,
nobody except Swapo and the United
Nations were really serous re the
independence of Namibia, and they
say that only Swapo was prepared to
fight for the independence of Na-
mibia.

Is it truc, Mr Mudge, that up to this
day, you kept your Republican Paty a
super-duper spartheid-party by clos-
img the party's doors to other than
whites, and that this was the reason
why Mr Kalangula left the DTA?

Is it not true that the DTA, similar
to AG 8, is super-aparthcid in accor-
dance with the wishes of the masters
across the Orange River?

unless | am wrong. you won't even
be in the guard's van! If the DTA
should win, we shall sull have anon-
white government which, if the DTA's
lies re Swapo were truc, will still
land us in the same boat.

Am I wrong, Mr Mudge, in belicv-
ing that the DTA will not lift a finger
to get Walvis Bay as OUR harbur,
even be it only for the sake of justice
and fairness (because Pretoria won't
like it, as they will then not be under
our blanket from where they could

easily start disinvesting against a
regime in Namibia which do not favour
their pleasure - did not the State

threaten to do 907)

Am | wrong if I say that you will
not lift a finger to introduce our own
currency and rid us of the valucless

the English and to please the apart-

Am I wrong, Mr Mudge, If | aay

If the DTA should win the election,

South Afnca will tell you and the
DTA that you owe them, that you
must now brush your teeth and sing
(which means back to square one -
Serve the masters faithfully)?

Mr Mudge, I beg of you, don't let
the DTA try and ghost us with thumb-
sucking stones and by doing 80, also
uy to frighten the hell out of us. Let
us rather have the facts re the DTA's
pnnciples and policy on how the
DTA intends ruling Namibia and
guiding us to peace and stability in
order to take our nightful place in the
world. Please, I ask this of you and
the DTA for the well-being of the
chilren of Namibia, and to help us
make the night decision.

Mr Mudge, if it pleases you, I still
have questions to ask, bocause I want

Upset with Untag

I WISH to express my heartfelt
sadness al the irresponsible attitude
of Untag in Namibia from April 1.

[ am disappointed in Untag in
genera) and Mr Martti Ahtisaari, for
their unwillingness to perform their
duties as expected of them by the
Namibian people.

On Apnil 1, a peaceful march of
the Namibian workers under leader-
ship of NUNW was forcefully stopped
by colonial, heavily armed police in
the absence of Untag police who are
Supposed to accompany them. Thanks
to the disciplined actions of the
workers themselves, injuries and
bloodshed was avoided since the
colonial police were under strict
command to act against the 15 000-
strong crowd if they proceeded with
the march to hand over a petition
protesting privatisation of public
property to Mr Louis Pienaar, the
Administrator General.

After the well-attended Swapo rally
in Windhock on April 1, Swapo
riembers and supporters on their
way back north were shot at by two
white vigilantes. Seven people were
injured, two scnously. When a local
pastor went to report the incident to
Untag personnel in Tsumeb, he found
the officer in an inebriated.

The most buming issue, which
forced me to write this lettcr, was
when civilians when to Untag per-
sonnel in Oshakati to report heavy
fighting between Plan and the colo-
nial army, the two Malaysian mem-
bers of Untag took no notice and
went on rcading thcir novels. Some
of them were seen sipping wine with
South African soldiers at Ondangue
amd Oshakat. ] am wondering whethe
Uhese international peacemakers are
really serious about what they are
doing in Namibia. I am also sur-

contnbute soldiers when they want

| would also like to express myself
on the decision by Mr Ahtisaari to
allow the notorious 101 and 202
battalions to be reactivated in order
to fight Swapo, Mr Ahtisaari's mis-
sion was lo make peace but instead
he agreed to the demands of the co-
lonial govermor to allow the same
groups to go ahead and continues
doing what thoy havo dono for yoars,

Mr Ahtisaari, through his actions,
has lost the respect and pularity he
has enjoyed since 1978.

I call upon all progressive forces
inside Namibia w take united and
decisive action. We should always
remember the inspi words of
Swapo President, 8am ujome, who
auld ""‘we the Nemiblans, are our
own liberators""’.

On Ahtteseri

PLEASE allow meto air my views
regarding the position of Mr Martti
Ahtissari in the current situation in
our country:

Sir, we are very perplexed by your
attitude tow ards our people under the
leadership of Swapo.

It is amazing that, as UN Special
Representative, who has come to
Namibia to make sure that the inter-
national procedures leading to inde-
pendence, are carried out with jus-
lice and without partiality to any
party, you have given the order to the
troops of South Africa to hunt down
forces who in fact were in thecountry
prior to the ceasefire.

This, to us who are yearning for
our freedom, clearly demonstrates
that you have taken a partial decision '
in favour of our colonisers. !' is a pity
that instead of bringing abuut peace,
you are encouraging the forces of the
racist. goverment to climinate
Namibians.

Swapo isa well-disciplined move-
ment and would not defy the guide-
lines and regulations set up and agreed
to concerning our transition to inde-
pendence.

Insteac of deploying Untag
peacekeeping forces two the area of
conflict to separate the warring sides,
you decided in favour of the one side.
Swapo forces then had no alternative
but to defend themselves against those |
who started hunting down our com-
batants.

Sir, if justice were to be done, you
would have acted impartially to
solvethe conflict. The Government
in Pretoria may have planned these
acts of violation in advance, to jeopar-
dise the peace process. They knew
long ago that anumber of Plan forces
were based inside Namibia. They
attacked our fighters on the day
implementation of the peace plan
started, and them put the blame on
our forces as the violators of the
peace process.

Then most of the world, including
Thatcher, started blaming

Gave their lives

AS ONE of the greatest fans of
your newspaper, allow me to air my
views conceming the recent clash
between Swapo combatants and South
African security forces.

First of all, 1 take my hat off to
those freedom fighters who gave their
lives for us to be free. (Not only
them, but for South African security
forces who didn't know what they
were doing, may God forgive them).
When I think of those who died, my
blood runs cold. Freedom was so
near and yet so far for them.

Secondly, the members of the UN
who were in favour of the reduction
of Untag from 7500 t0 4650, should
now bow their heads in shame. What
& great mistake it was.

According to eyewitnesses, the
security forces fired against the
combatants first. AndI believe them.
One may ask why? Because I cannot
believe someone, who, for 70 years,
has made me a subject of the evil
system called apertheid.

Yet the US blames Swapo. Why?
Are boy bien. blamed because they
foughu beck in self-defence? Or is it

_ because the US and its allies call
fimeptanpmene ane eee

Swapo a ‘terrorist’ organisation?
Swapo is a liberation movement and
we are proud of it. According to
international law and the UN Char-
ter, we have the right to resist South
African occupation.

The Untag forces were supposed
to secure peace. Where were they?
The Botha's are making fools of them.
The UN is now experiencing what we
have experienced for many years.

The Swapo combatants were re-
grouping to be confined wo bases
when the security forces fired on
them. Who gave that instruction?
Botha or Ahtisaari?

Last but not least: Untag gives the
green light to South Africa to re-
deploy Koevoet and 101 Battalion to
assist them in their peacekeeping task.
Will a child’s heart ever forget who
killed his mother? Will amother ever
forget who raped her ten-year-old
daughter? Some may forgive, but
they will never forget.

We will continue to resist our
occupation: Europe tasted Nazi oc-
cupation and opposed it. We have the
right to do the same.

antagonism rather than making roont
for reconciliation. We notice that the
DTA has chosen to fight against Swapo
rather than South Africa, which has
occupied the country for many years.

Mudge has also been making ac-
cusations about atrocities in Swapo
settlements, something he has no
evidence of. Yet he and his support-
ets appear to have Koevocet at their
disposal, who are the culprits as far
as atrocities in Namibia are con-
cerned. Mudge and Kaura are not
happy to see a Namibian nation
marching to freedom. They appear to
be perpetrating tribalism and divi-
sion among the people of this coun-

A few weeks ago Kaura was inter-
viewed on the BBC where he claimed
that Swapo leaders were provoking

his supporters and he warned about

‘fights’ which may erupt in Karu-
tura. He also warned Swapo leaders
that their safety may be jeopardised
if such ‘fights’ break out.

The anti-Swapo propaganda being
carried out by the DTA is the reverse
of the truth. We have evidence that
the DTA is doing the very things they
accuse Swapo of.

Dirk Mudge and Kaura must real-
ise that in Swapo, they are dealing
with amovement whichis politically
mature. Swapo is not interested in
bringing Namibians into conflict or
the county into neo-colonialism, as
the DTA is doing.

Mudge and Kaura must control
their supporters not to provoke peace-
ful Swapo supporters any longer.
Swapo supporters do not interfere
with the affairs of other groups. Let
us campaign peacefully for the elec-
tions without intimidating anyone.
Mudge and Kaura must know what
the consequences of civil war is - that
is, if they have ready history. We in
Namibia do not want such a situation
here. Our people have suffered for
too long and they need peace end
freedom, which Swapo has and still
stands for.

THIS letter was drafted for Untag

the letter:

1. Restrict all SA forces to base.
With Plan fighters beyond the 16th

public. On April 30, security farses
came out of bases and intimidated —
peoplé, tearing down NUNW plac- .
ards. Letting the SADF from con-
finement doesn’t give peace a chance.

3. Residents are compelled to put
on DTA T-shirts and give DTA signs.
What about democracy?

4. Residents here are threatened if
they demonstrate the black power
salute.

5. We need more Untag offices in
the north to facilitate contact by ci-
vilians. In this way contact with Untag
could be made easier.

6. Untag lacks contact with resi-
dents - they should talk freely to
them and this would solve immedi-
ate problems.

We call upon Untag to improve
and fulfill its responsible task.

Who's monitoring

Which is the monitoring force,
UNTAG or the South African Army?

1. It looks as if Mr Ahtisean can-
not refuse or argue any request oF
move put forward by the South Afn-
can government

1.1 After the security force al-
tacked the PLAN-fighters on Apnill,

he allowed the South African army to
leave their bases for a large attack on
SWAPO fighters.

1.2 After the confinement of the
South African troops to their bases
for 60 hours, we find they had al-
ready left their bases before the des-
ignated O6h00 on April 29. They
started to fire allert shots during the
whole night of the 28th. The UNTAG
forces in the north will agree with
me. From 02h00 on the moming of
the 29th their Casspirs and Rauels
were on the road.

Why do they have to monitor the
withdrawal of the SWAPO fighters?
Will SWAPO fighters do the same
when they withdraw? What is the
UNTAG force doing here?

2.So many Koevoet/police are
deployed and moving around in
Northern Namibia in their Casspirs
amongst the people. Why don’t they
stay at their police statons? Is it
because because there is noroom for
all of them? The whoke KOEVOET
was just give thename ‘police’. Why
keep such a big police force? Is is yust
to distribute DTA pamfiets, helping
in their campaign as they did on
Apni] 29 at Othingo, on the west of
Oshakati and elsewhere?

3.Does Mr Ahtisaari know that
South Africa is doing all this to vio-
late Res 4357? Does he know that
South Africa wants to waste time
unt] no more time is left and they
will come up with requesis to with-

4. For years, South Africa has told

Ahtisaari has falled

Forces making for dividing the
UN Special Representative, Mr Marthi
Ahtissari, Magaret Thatcher, South
Africa, DTA, Koevoet and Action
Contra Res 435 have become forces
who want to divide the Namibians
for freedom, Jove, peace and unity.

Ahtisaari has failed in his mission,
like Dr Ercher, the Vice Sectetary
General of Kurt Waldheim in 1973.
Because the ends he served will take
him no further than himself.

It is SWAPO's deep conviction
that all the people wish to be free and
that their desire for freedom is rooted

in the soul of every one of us. A
people long subjectedto foreighh ”
domination, however, does not al-
ways find it casy to translate that
wish into action. Under arbitrary rule,
people are apt to become lethargic,
theis senses are dulled. Fear becomes
the dominant force in their lives; fear
of breaking the colonial and apart-

and fear. We gave active expression
to the universal longing to be free.

Our leaders strenghten the peoples’
faith in themselves, and cncourgac
them to take part in the freedom
struggle.

I am convinced the unity of the

Who is the genuine people's leadez/

Since the heyday of Pretoria's
regime in Namibia has left a dis-
graceful page in the Namibian his-
tary by dividing the entire nation into
regional groups during its heavy
destruction and brutalization, peace -
thristy Namibian people have been
waiting for the true leader to bring
about the total eradication of foreign
domination and oppression in their
only and one Namibia.

As the days of independence ap-
proach, here comes the question; Who
is the genuine people's leader?

In order to avoid nco-colonialism
and corrupt leaders in the Namibian
history, the peace-thirsty Namibian
people with loyalty and fidelity en-
tus} the respected great leader presi-
‘<a Sam Naujoma, who heroically

succeeded in lead-
ma teregglng people of Namibia
in their Long and hot struggle against
the Pretoria racist regime and its

allies of the entire capitalist block for
almost 29 years. In this way, the
Tespected great Icader President
Nujoma has achieved a great respect
among the Namibian people, as well
as internationally.

The Namibian people acclaim the
SWAPO great leader president Sam
Nujoma as their genuine people's
leader who will create the new state
of Namibia with prospenty, peace,
democracy, national security, justice
and social economics.

Therefore, the nation is being called
upon to be vigilant and unite as one
nation to stand firmly against the
enemy's anti-SWAPO psychologi-
cal propaganda which is being pres-
enuy cared out by the so-called
secunty force so that they can mis-
lead the people from choosing their
genuine people's leader because they
are afraid of SWAPO'S inevitable
victory in the forthcoming elections.

In spite of the enemy propaganda,
l am appealing to the entire Namib-
ian nation forcach and every individ-
ual tlocast his/her vote for SWAPO in

the forth coming ¢ inorder to —
enable the people's oggansation to
score more than the two-thirds ma-
jorty of the Namibian population so
that we can create a new Namibia in
which each and every Namibian ¢citi-
zen will enjoy the fundamenni human
rights and lead a happy life free from
oppression, exploitation and injus-
uce under the leadership of the genu-
ine people's leader president Sam
Nujoma.

SWAPO is the people and the people
are SWAPO.

Forces making for dividing the
Ahusaari, Magaret Thatcher, South
Africa, DTA, Koevoet and Action
Contra Res 435 have become forces
who want to divide the Namibians
for freedom, love, peace and unity.

Ahusaari has failed in his mission,
like Dr Ercher, the Vice Secretary
General of Kurt Waldheim in 1973.
Because the exis he served will take
him no further than himself.

There are two major areas of concern
- the status of Walvis Bay and the
Angolan war.

Walvis Bay, Namibia's only deep
ocean-gomng port, poses a single major
threat to any post-independent gov-
ernment in Namibia as Jong as South
Africa continues its claim over the
port. Despite the United Nations rul-
ing thet Walvis Bay is an integral
part of Namibia, Pretoria continucs
to regard and treat the nort as part and
parcel of South Afric].

Walvis Bay is not only a vital
anchorage for imports and exports,
but provides a large military base
and airstrip for South Africa tw con-
tinue its destabilising tactics against
the neighbouring black African states.
This will enable South Africa tokeep
war away from its mainland. No
county has so far dared to launch a
direct attack on the South African
illegally occupied Namubia as a spring-
board for its periodic incursions into
southern Angola.

Walvis Bay has even greater im-
plications in terms of its relationship
to a fubure independent Namibia. Since
the port 1s part of South Africa, those
Namibians residing in Swakopmund
and elsewhere will need to have visas
to leave and enter the port. And a
horde of Walvis Bay residents em-
ployed at the Rossing Uranium Lid,
outside Swakopmund, will have to
periodically renew their visas to en-
ter and jeave the port on their way to
and from work.

Also, the SA officials travelling by
road to Walvis will need to apply for
visas to leave and enter Namibian |
territory. Walvis Bay alsa stands as a
potential cover for any opponents of
a new Namibian government, and

Tripartite Agreement between SA,
Angols and Cube, on December 22,
hed nothing to guarantee an end to
the Angolan civil war or reduce US
aid to Unita. This can only be weighed
against the fact that it is pretty much
within the interest of the west, or the
US, to have Jonas Savimbi in power
in Angola.

The war in Angola is thus nota war
of liberation, but a struggle for power.
The US justifies its support for Unita
as a way to “‘combat Soviet expan-
sionism*’. Hence the fear exists that
a new born Namibian nation might
80 pro-cast, and mm the lightof this the
“crusade against Soviet expansion-
ism""’ will continue. The misguided
belief that the Russians are bent on
‘world conquest’ has given rise to
one of the twentieth century miscon-
ceptions: whenever the third world
nations rise and make a claim, they
they must have been told by some-
body else - if not the Americans, then
the Russians.

This limits the world in terms of
east and west, and undermines the
sovereignity of other existing na-
tions. Henceforth, there is nothing

that rules out the possibility that any
adversaries of anew Namibian gov-
ernment will find a helping hand in
America and be used as instruments

to make trouble in the interests of the
west.

Zaire provides an excellent ex-
ample of western stranglehold on a
developing third world nation.

I have been battling to understand
the proverb of my ancestors. My
question has been, why did they look

For many years we have been out-

from our parents, sisters, brothers,

what it meant when some of our
fellow compatriots were told that
their nextof kin were ‘eliminated’ by
Swapo. These lics have causcd
immense damage and confusion.

Maybe our ancestors were afraid
of liars because what they said did
not only affect a limited number of
people, but the enure population. A
witch destroys only one or two people,
and then that is the end.

When liars speaks of death, they
mean life, when they speak of de-

THE future of the country is being
shaped NOW ... don’t you want to
partake?

This question I wish to pose to al)
my white compatriots who regard
Namibia as their home country and
who want their children and grand-
children to live here peacefully and
prosperously ; and to thos}: who are in
the privileged position to influence
the economic and social develop-
ment of our country after independ-
ence, but who foresee darkness and
insecurity in the future.

During these past decades we have
consistently ignored or distorted
certain realities in our country (and
the press has played its major part)
until they became facts in our his-
tory. After all, the process of inde-
pendence has begun, Resolution 435
is being implemented and the Swapo
leadership and even its President,
Sam Nujoma, did return from exile.

‘Let us look at some aspects of the
present situation:

Election campaign and intimida-
tion: This is the first general election
in this country, and aggressive and
‘macceptable behaviour by incited
perty members can be expected. But
we are very fortunate, as the sole
country in Africa, to gain independ-
sive peace plan, tad we c ofan exisn-
guerrilla fighters do not practice in-
timidation at the point of the gun
and maintain a rather strict disci-
pline. Great respect can also be ex-
tended to Swapo for its restrained
reaction to the assassination of An-
ton Lubowski, the most provocative
incident thus far. Let us hope that the
recent increase in violence will not
escalate to an unmanag({able level.
Election result: Most parties have
resorted to an anti-Swapo election
campaign on a very low level. In-
stead of informing the electorate of
future programmes, aims, policies
etc, they attack other parties and do
not hesitate to instill fear and hatred,
often based on lies. The shocking
incidents of April 1, and the un-
solved question of Swapo dissident
camps have put oil on the flames of
general accusations. As much as we
would like to put a finger on certain
issues and condemn certain actions,
we should not become blind to the
fact that for the majority of Namibi-
aris Swapo is still the party of the
future. Swapo will win the election.
Will we be able to live with that? |
think we can - if we are prepared to
contribute as true Namibians.
Reconciliation: For the past few
years, Swapo has been following a
course of reconciliauon among

Namibians,
The former should not
| permtuelt a6 8 betweon black
ee etal
The former struggle should not
as a conflict between black
and white but should terminate as a
conflict between the South African
colonial power and the Namibian
population. Not only el the biggest
political rally in Namibia, on Sunday
September 24, has Nujoma offered
reconciliation and cooperation. This
gesture was not motivated byu the |
wish to gain the votes of the whites.
Swapo does not depend on these votes
to win the election. It is rather based
on the willingness to learn from the
experiences of other African coun-
tries and is guided by the aim of a
peaceful and stable future for all

Namibians.

Appeal: I would like to appeal to
all, to recognise and accept the reali-
ties, and not to be deceived by ide-
ologists, politicians and a one-sided
press. See, hear and think for your-
self.

Accept the offer of reconciliation
andi cooperation instead of sneering,
spreading false rumours or laughing
about distasteful pamphiets. Grab the

ty at this point of history
and regard the coming independence
oa , rather than a threat.
You can become involved at all lev-
els, and it is important everywhere. It
is necessary in our daily relations
with other people.

Talk about fears and negative
expectations, but also understand and
share the anticipated joy of many
Namibians about an independent
Namibia.

Great challenges lie ahead for all
- professionals and experts to contrib-
ute to the development of Namibia.
Ever so often economical questions
are being discussed during which
businessmen just shrug their shoul-
ders or show their dismay. These
economists too, are challenged to
accept the realities. Contribute, by
sharing your knowledge and expen-
ence, to the formulation of a new
economic policy
—- ~The times of “alles- -sal-regkom''

Botha’s threat

I PERCEIVED with dismay the
threatening statement made by South
African Foreign Affairs Minister,
Roelof Botha, on his recent visit to
Windhock to the effoct that *‘if any-
thing unforescen happens between

1 would like to remind the colonisers
that we did not invite South Africa to
invade our beloved Namibia and
subject it to colonialism and ql] that
gocs with it, and their presence
has always been illegal, nor did we
consent to the German fascism of
von Trotha.

We fought back tooth and nail
against these forces until today when
the deeply yearned-for freedom and
independence is about to be born.

We know South Afnca is not
committed to genuine implementa-
tion of 435; and if it was not for the
heavy burden of war, which the oc-
cupier could not sustain, then the
future of this country would still be
locked in chains.

If any ‘unforeseen’ happens in this
country, as Mr Botha fears, then it
will undoubtedly be the fault of Pre-
toria. Namibians are peace loving
people who have no intention of
invading other nations or neighbours.

Mr Botha should restrain his forces
and cease their clandestine activi-
ues. South Africa must not attempt
to create a pretext to invade this
country to perpetuate colonialism or
institute neo-colonialism.

It is unacceptable for the SADF or
SAP to returm to our soil under any
circumstances.

They should be restrained and
disciplined. This nation docs not want
the smell of blood while striving for
peace, stability and the right to na-

Uonhood.

Chief Riruako seemed to be out of

that we build a nation hand in hand,

It is not Swapo or the AG which had

would be the last person to put the

Chief Riruako must know that itis

case has not been solved by the
Supreme Court and that his ancestors
were not the first to settled in the
Eastern Caprivi. The Chief and his
elements should then be prepared for

Cinef Moraliswam has been the
plaintiff in the border/chieftamsiup

that we are independent, to ask the
Honourable President, as a neutral
person, to help resolve the issue once
and for all so that both Chiefs respect
one another and restore peace in the
region. The Chief ahould face reality
now. He knows very well how ex-
pensive the court case has been for
both Masubia and Mafwe factions.
People were forced to contnbute
because of his actions.

He obviously thought that by tak-
ing the case to court he would be the
victor. It is for these reasons I want
him to sit down and account for what
he has done. He has sown hatred and
mistrust instead of uniting the people,
as the role of chief should be. I see the
Chief now gives a clenched fist sa-
lute; as far as | witnessed, he was a
UDF and later an NPF supporter in

It is my wish that the President
should solve this problem to help the
two chiefs to know their tribal juris-
dictions. Caprivi will not be the first
region to be demarcated, but chiefs
in other regiona know their jurisdic-
tion and that is why there are no
senseless claims in other areas.

THE nonsense about Plan ‘gangs’ in
the north has come to my attention.
For the past weeks Plan combatants
have been deployed in the province
of criticism by joumalists who in- |
vent stories in order to supply copy
for professional vendors of political
slander in this country.

The matter was also brought up by
Mr Eric Biwa (NPF) in Parliament
and others who expressed concern
about the deteriorating secunty situ-

~ ation un the north.

The electorate expect the Parlia-
ment to attack burning issues in the
country like education, health, un-
| employment, houses etc.
Certain members of Parliament are
apparently insensitive to the fact that
Namibia is a newly-borm nation,
emerging from the debris of apart-
politics has gone. The time is now for
realism and people are waiting for
concrete and constructive program-
més which will assist the long down-
trodden nation in realising its hopes
and aspirations.

We are all affected when there is
lawlessness in any part of the coun-
try. As the opposition is concemed,
80 is the Government. Our President
has also expressed his government’s
concem about the breakdown of law
and order and the Minister of Home
Affairs deployed extra police units
along the border.

The problem is that the situation is
not being presented in the right per-
spective in certain quarters. What I
have learned from the people in the
affected area, is totally different to
Mr Biwa's assertion. The citizens of
the region are concerned about the
fact that Unita elements are threaten-
ing both their safety and their prop-
erty.

So I say ‘hands off Plan’, the
members of which have endured alot
of suffering to achieve peace and
freedom in this country.

On forgiveness

TRY forgiving a friend who betrays
a confidence, or a co-worker who
telJs lies about you. When the real
effort of forgiveness takes place, there
is nothing easy about it. Instinct urges
us to pay back in kind.
Some people are capable of heroic
effort in reconciling: others not. There
is usually a pause between the hurt
and the time when trust and love can
take root again. Forgiveness is part
of a process that begins with hurt and
ends, inits final goal, with reconcili-
atjon.
It works only when we become aware
of the depths and causes of the ange:
burning in us so that we can forgive
wholeheartedly and ensure anendur-
ing peace.
Too often, we bypass forgivencss
entirely. We race from our hurtto an
arent reconciliation without tak-
ing stock of what must truly be for-
given before lasting healing can take
place. We try to get past the difficult
part too quickly,“for we havo been
since childhood to keep

2 aff upper lip, proiend that we are

* 17, fh een reel

whether deliberate or accidental.
The ability to reconcile cannot be
tushed. We owe it to one another to
offer time to confront our hurts, to
face our wounds head-on, to vent our
emotions. Only then can the real
healing begin.

When Jesus said ‘love your enemy’,
he meant every word of it. We never
get rid of an enemy by meeting hate
with hate; wo get nd of an enemy by
getting rid of enmity.
Reconciliation depends on the situ-
alion and the people involved. In the
end, all forgivers do the same thing:
they restore self-worth to the of-
fender; they cancel a debt; they expe-
rience such peace that they lose the
urge to retaliate and live as freer
persons unshackled by the weight of
a hurt.

‘DURING the years of illegal occupa-

lived across the road from my home,
and every time a black person en-

a ‘show of force’ and spit in the strect
to show his resentment.

Every Friday moming one would

doned.

But my ulusions of peace were
shattered when the UN moved in,
and among others, the Kenyans in-
sisted on being physically fit and
taking the battalion for a run down
Palm Street every moming. Every
white-owned dog in the area went
bananas, as the troops ran past in
heavy boots.

But my story has not ended...

Two weeks ago, after a heavy Fn-
day night, I fell into bed, and at
O5h00 my nightmare began. Out of
the base came the deep wail of a
bombing siren. I leapt from my bed
and jumped for my pants, images of
Kassinga and Ngiva pounding in my
head. I stumbled onto the lawn ex-
pecting chaos, but it was only the
troops being woken up.

Nothing has changed. The base is
stil there, slap~bang in the middle of

Could T make a suggestion: tha

knocks on bungalow doors to wake

themselves up! Please, this is not

ALTHOUGH the word reconciliation
has been created with the purpose of

On proper leadership

I WOULD like to comment on the ;

pew organizations that have recently
been formed, namely, the TUN
(Teachers Union of Namibia) and the
NASEM (the Namibian Student
Education Movement).

Firstly, I would like to deal with
the new student body. In regard to its
claims that it has been formed as a
*‘geeutt of a leadership vacuum within
the student community in Namibia’
and, secondly, that the existing stu-
deot organizations have failed to

**proper leadership for
students because of their
Hinks with political partics’', I would
tthe to make the following comments.

Be is no surprise to me to read such
oni article because this is the case and
alwayshas been with reactionary and
Opportunistic forces whose aim has

been to mislead and infuse ideas of
the past colonia) administrations. In
my point of view, the student move-
ment has been farmed to foster the
interests and political ideals of their
respective political parties who are
at present on ‘death row’.

Thoy see clearly that Nanso, which
has been a progressive student or-
ganization in the past, has won a
victorious fight against the regimo
thar rlegalty occupied our country,
and which suppressed most of the
students and people of Namibia.

There was no leadership vacuum
in Nanso. This can be proved by its
winning of the objectives it stood for.
Nanso members and supporters have
been harassed, detained and even
expelled from schools because of
their political beliefs and quest for
freedom To say that Nanso has failed
to serve student interests, is mere
bias. Nanso leadership succeeded in
mobilizing students all over the
country. It made them realize that
their interests were being suppressed
and needed to be fought for. Nanso’s
liberation standpoints, therefore,
coincided with those of Swapo and
Nantu.

Nanso could not isolate itself from
Swapo because they had common
goals to achieve. To fight a war in
disunity is to give the enemy victory

and therefore students needed to be |

linked in order to be free, get better
education, proper housing, and well-
equipped libraries, etc.

Nanso did not look for or concen-
trate on student issues alone, mainly
because the dignity of the whole nation
was underpinned by the colonial
regime. As a student body consisting
of intellectuals, it had to take account
of the socio-economic situation in
the country. Students cannot only be
free at schoo! and ‘unfree’ when they
go home. Both students and their
parents needed to be liberated.

1am assuring the leadership of the

new organization thet Nets

tributed a lot to the tmeparsiecos 6f
this nation from foreign domination
and influence. I appeal to the new
organization not to create confasion
among students coumrywide. We
know whose interests they represent
and promote. They must stop swim-
ming in the pool of confusion. Their
organization was formed to counter-
act Nanso that has stood firm in
opposition to the abuse of human
rights.

My question to them is: if Nanso
failed to achieve what it fought for
and a leadership vacuum does exist,
then what have they achieved so far?

If you were serious, why didn’t
you form that organization months
ago, lo stand up against Koevoet
elements which used to disrupt les-
sons, beat up students, and erect army
bases at schools?

With regard the formation of the
TUN: it also has political motives in
their formation, which serve the same
purpose as that of the NASEM.

¢ organization has not been
formed to strive for teachers’ umty
and interests but to counteract Nantu.

Tappeal to teachers country wide to
be careful and cautious before join-
ing any altemative union which seeks
to divide the unity which already
prevails in our nation. They should
join the organizations who strive and
work for peace, nationhood and fra-
termty.

Forward with progressive people's
organizations.

ALLOW me to air my views on behalf
of many. I feel disappointed when I
| see follow former combatants who
are wandering around the streets of
Namibia’s cities and towns.

Being a former combatant myself,
I feel that we are all neglected and
forgotten by the Government that we
have fought for. We had no time to
eam a living in the past years, simply
because we were engaged in the armed
struggle for the liberation of Na-
mibia. The struggle has been long
and bitter, many of our brothers and
sisters have sacrificed their precious
lives for the liberation of our mother-
land, others are crippled for life.

Now that the struggle for political
independence is won, why is it still
continuing in cases like ours? We
suffered during the years of armed
struggle in the bush, but we still
continue to suffer, even after inde-
pendence, even worse than was the
case inthe bush. We have no jobs and
if one manages to get work, then
there is no roof over his or her head.

Our qualifications, which some of
us obtained abroad, are disregarded
by employers, yet most of us have
leamed at institutions in independent
countries where there is no segrega-
tion or racial discnmination.

In Namibia we are asked to pro-
vide the employers with Bantu Edu-
cation certificates which in my view
is nonsense.

It is really disappointing to leam
that most of the civil servants in our
Government offices are former
Koevoet members who were deliber-
ately put in certain positions by the

colonial regime. Many of these people .

do not possess a Standard 10 or col-
lege certificate like many of us do.
These people were merely employed
becanse of the colour of their skin
and they dominate in every workplace.

Letter

We have no chance anywhere. The
Government should seriously look
into our problem and do something
about it. We read in newspapers daily
that the enemy of peace, Unita, and
their collaborators are trying to cre-
ate conditions conducive for another _
war in our country. Yet the Govern-
meat does not want to allow all those
who are able-bodied former Plan
combatants to join the national army.
Are we ignoring the realities?

The enemy want destabilization
and poverty to take root here as has
occurred in Angola and Mozambique.
It is time to think twice and make
sure that the heroes and heroines who
fought for the liberation of this coun-
try should be at least fully integrated
into the police and national! army in
order to defend the gains of the revo-
lution against enemy encroachment.

We want to see the changes for
peace and independence of our people
maintained by the loyal men and
women we now see wandering around
without jobs. Reconciliation must
make things balance.

The Government must seo to it that
these brave men and women are
assisted by the stato, even if it means
creating a demobilization fund so
that they can make ends’ meet.

Law of the knife

I WISH toexpress my feelings about
the violation of human nghis in
Namibia. At this point I would like to
urge my fellow Namibians to respect
life more than money or property.
Many people have lost their lives
since independence. Mainly because
some people do not want to respect
the laws and constitution of the
Republic of Namibia which provides
forthe protection of life, and other
human rights.
The use of knives to kill others is the
order of the day in Namibia, espe-
cially among young people. In order
to reduce or eradicate the problem
altogether, I appeal to the govern-
mem to introduce laws to prohibit
the carrying of knives in public places.
The knife is as dangorous as the gun,
and there nwust be punishment to
ensure that knife-users are deterred.
What we have to bear in mind is that
the killing of innocent people is a
violation of human righté in terms of
our laws,
Note that the constitution says that
all human beings are born free and
in dignity and rights, without
of any kind, such as race,

It has taken me quite a long time to

Angola has done for Namibia. I know
that the price Angola has paid for our
independence is higher and I am sure
that it cannot be measured in either
gold or money. The people of Angola
and their socio-economic infrastruc-
tures were the daily targets of the
apartheid regime and its mercenar-

However, today we are the victors!
The precious blood of the Namibian
and Angolan daughters and sons has
crowned our struggle with freedom
and justice. I am aware of He fact
that our enemies are still v-Arking
clay and night to destabilise our peace,
happiness and fratemal comradeship
and, therefore, there is still a need for
Vigilance at all times.

[believe that Angola and Namibia
can work together in order to bring
peace and stability to our beautiful
region of southern Africa.

I would like also to thank my friends

me assure the Times and DTA that
they are many.

I think now that the Times is cer-
tain that there 1s po action that will be
taken; there are even timos when it
revertstonaked racism in ite descrip-
tion of ‘black’ African countries, while
reference to South Africa creates the
impression of a docile dog creeping
with its tail between its logs in front
of its master. Lest ] deviate, let me
return to the issue I am writing about.

The belief that whatever deliber-
ately negative remarks or unfounded

Yt

accusahions are made against the
govemmment will force it to collapse,
borders on insanity. Boasting about
handedly with such reports ehock the
imagination of any human being. Itis
with this in mind that I read of the
‘Evidence on Namibian coup’ in the
October 5 edition of the Times.

The said newspaper reports oxten-
tively on evidence given by Josef
Kjeynhans, who told the court that
some people tnedto recruit him fora
‘coup’ against the govemment. The
concept that itis only armiescapable
of staging coups, as repeatedly said
by the Times, is 20 ridiculous, but
their attempt tocreate the impression

that the arms theft was only a minor
‘adventure’, is, 1 fee] an aftempt to
downplay the seriousness of the crime.
The thieves will finally, in the cyes
of the Times, be nothing more than
‘youths in search of adventure’.

I hate to think what would have
happened if such a theft took place in
the previous dispensation and if the
‘adventurers’ were black and not white.

This comes after weeks of spocu-
Jation in the same newspaper as to
whether there was really a coup plot
in Namibia or not. It is interesting, to
say tho least, that this nowspapor
should now have a headline report on
the coup. One wonders about this
paper's sense of journalistic ethics,
for in the past couple of weeks it
decried the coup story which was
broken by The Namibian as a ‘fig-
ment"" of that paper’s imagination.

Now the Times of Namibia will
probably become the champion against
the coup. It seems to be trendy for the
Times to, on the one hand, deny the
existence of a coup and on the other
to be the first to report on evidence
given about it.

Whether one calls it an intended
coup or not, is purely academic. In

_Let me conclude by reminding the
Times and like-minded newspapers:
A free press? Sure. But that free press
should have a responsibility. If the

do it for them. What is needed is a
code of journalistic ethics or some-
“thing to define the parameters of

I WOULD Like to reply to the letter
‘Unfair to aliens’ of October 2, by
‘Fed-up Alien’. It is clear from the
fetter that the anonymous writer suf-
fers from racism. My concem here,
however, is to put the matter right.

First and foremost, I hope the water
is aware that every country has a law
relating to ‘aliens’, ‘foreigners’ and
‘illegal immigrants’ or whatever one
prefers tocall them. Such laws serve
a number of purposes. First, they
protect the security of the country.
Second, to keep a record of aliens in
the event of a population census.
Thirdly, to enable law enforcement
machinery to effectively control border
traffic.

In response to your letter, it is my
opinion that many foreigners who
came to Namibia in the past five
years did not do so because they
loved Namibia. Neither did people
from South Africa come here be-
cause they did not agree what was
happening there. After all, at that
time the same things were happening
in both countries.

If they thought what was happen-
ing in South Africa was wrong, they
should have stayed and applied their
‘skills and experiance’ to exert pres-
sure for change. However, these
‘skilled’ people preferred to come
and take advantage of the peace brought
about by the ‘unskilled labour’ of
Namibia.

The govemment must adhere to
the constitution, which is the su-
preme law of the land. It applies to
everyone, whether goverment
employes or not, or whether black,
i, Asian, of African.

foreigners arrived here for different
reasons. Many of them were not
genuine. Is it not surprising to you
that most people involved in dia-
mond emuggling, rhino and ivory are
foreigners?

You claim that ‘aliens’ and ‘South
Africans’ are the only people with
skills. Many South Afncans here came
because they could not be absorbed
in the South African economy. They
did not all come here with skills and
expenence - the colonial policy was
to provide job opportunit#s here for
those people at the expense of the
Namibians. Namibia has been used
as a laboratory for upgrading and
training South Afncan unskilled
labour.

The people who yame back from
exile are Namubiac‘citizens. They
were bom here and their parents and
relatives are here.

They were fighting for the inde-
pendence of this country and are
fully qualified as citizens.

We do not see many signs of the
‘skilled’ te the ‘unskilled’ here.
L hope you will take the lead.

You cannot claim to be patriotic to
one country while carrying dual citi-
zenship. ‘Fed-up Alien’, the south-
etn borders are open.

PLEASE allow me to comment on
President Sam Nujoma’s visit to
. to next page
to next page

Keotmanshoop on Tuesday October
23.

As always, President Nujoma, on
iis arrival at the Keetmanshoop sta-
dium, captured the minds and spirits
of all the people present. Especially
the schoolchildren were ecstatic as
President Nujomia passed the stand-
ing crowd to the stage.

The very first thing that struck him
was the quite obvious attitude of
pupils and teachers of the local white
schools. They were seated separately
from the pupils of the so-called black
schools.

The President immediately called
upon the pupils and the teachers of
the white schools tocomecloser, and
mix with pupils of the other schools.
This call was welcomed with great
applause by the people present.

This practical gesture demonstrated
our President's seriousness with the
policy of reconciliation. He again
referred to the children as the future
leaders of Namibia. It is the pupils of
the pre-primary to secondary level
who must learn to live and play with
one another.

The speech by the President per-
sonally gave me hope for the future
and the efforts of our young govem-
ment. The optimistic manner in which
he faces his and our many challenges,

“wee yeassuring, and we must pray for

lasting peace and stability in our
beautiful country.

Our President also proved that he
remains a man of the people, despite
his high position. It gave me great
joy to see how humble and down. to-
earth he is.

At the end of his address, the Mayor
tned to restore order as the school-
children became so excited. Presi-
dent Nujoma ga‘e them the rest of
the day off.

Ag left the stadium I felt spiritu-
ally satisfied. As I saw our lads started
to play soccer on the grass, [remem-
bered that it was also the SOth birth-
day of Pele, the world's greatest soccer

- player.

Who knows, maybe one of them
will one day be Namibia's Pele, with
the opportunities and leadership that
are offered by our great President,
Sam Nujoma.

to assist the police in getting
_ sid of these people and having
these elements arrestod. [hope
that the police will take the
matter one step further and
outlaw the carrying of knives

We are children of the new

the policy of national recon-
ciliation, the policy of forgive-
ness and focus on the future.

Firat of all, let us examine
the significance of March 21.
The date is and will remain an
iliumdnating day in the Na-
mibian calendar. Liluminating
in the sense thal it is the day on
which the yoke of colonialism,
which was imposed on us, was
buried for ever.

It was the day on which
dignitaries from all over the
world joined the brave sons
and daughters of this country
to witness the burial of coloni-
alism by replacing the South
African flag with that of the
now Republic of Namibia.

Tt was a wonderful and
moving occasion, which pres-
ont and future generations will
nevor forget. It was a day on
which the nationalist fighters
stood band in hand and said
“look, our sacrifices have not
been in vain’.

As tho freedom fighters were

is humane and suitable for
Nantibians.

The most striking aspect of
the policy is that it promotes
tho valuss of end buman
dignity. It intends to unite the
Namibian people irrespective
of colour, race, nationality or
origin. This policy deserves
our respect.

Many have complained about
the negative aspects of national
reconciliation but little has been
beard about its menits.

The success of the policy
depends on the performances
of those implementing it. The
menits of this policy are more
than its dements. This policy
if, in my view, meant to pro-
vide a breathing space for those
harbounng illusions about the
past colonial system to adjust
themselves to a new era of
national independence, pence,
stability and the humane ap-
proach.

As we rejoiced on March 21
last year, we were equally
worried about what we had
inherited from the then noton-
ous colonial regime in terms
of debt, unemployment and
poktical instability (the latter
with regard to tendencies of
tribalism and racial discnmi-
nation based on colour).

The problem is, how are we
going to pay the socalled debt
without economic prosperity,
and how are we going to com-
unsmpioy ment situation with-
out ecanomic growth?

The government's effortsto
combet the unemployment

One of the Government's
main priorities is education. It
is the finest foundation of all.
for the nation-building proc-
ess. It is also the comerstone
upon which to rest our surest

public.

As we approach the first
anniversary of independence,
we need to be devoted to the
cause of national building
through the process of national
reconciliation.

Failure to implement this
positively will effect the con-
cept of democracy in this coun-
try.

We cannot achieve any of
these objectives unless we are
hardworking, disciplined, law-
abiding and implement the
policy of national reconcili-
alion in a positive light.

'Mbotsotsos'

[WOULD hike to air my views
regarding the statement by
Police Commissioner Siggi
Eimbeck in which he criticised
residents of Katutura of hav-
ing killed two members of
“mbotsotso”.

I make state categorically
that it is regrettable. that the
Commissioner made such a
etatement, regarding people
taking the law into their own
hands.

Even though Namibia is an
, state, people are
gt Gee to move hers and there.

Yet the police accuse people
who live among bad elements,
for killing them in defending
an elderly man. You should
not blame people whose aims
are to do away with cnminals
in this coyatry. Rather take
steps agaizist the criminals.

The houses where these bad
elements are staying are well-
known to everybody, the po-
lice included. The “mbotsotso""
should not be allowed to take
the law into their own hands
and disturb peace and stability
in this country. Moreover, we
are aware of those who col-
laborate with the mbotsotso”’.

The reason why Katutura
residents decided not to fold
their arms and watch their
beloved fellow citizons being
killed by “mbotsotsos” is
because if they are brought
before justice they will proba-
bly be granted bail or acquitted
by a court of law.

“PHEL ya Nangoloh alleged that
a formals activist of his socal-
fed Nationa! Society for Hu-
man Rights visited Lubango
and was informed by a com-
maander at a Swapo house there
that ‘Swapo detainees’ would
only be released and repatri-
ated in 1998 if Swapo gets a
two-thirds majority wn othe

detainees are being re-educated
and that that ‘certain high offi-
_ cials in the Namibian Ministry
of Education pay visits there to
address the detainces'.

Phil ya Nangoloh even wen!
90 far to calegorate and com-
pile a list of people who alleg-
odly went missing while in
Swapo detention end number-
ing them eccording to their
tribes. He claims that among
tue said number there were 36
Ceprivians, 38 Ndongas, 35
Kovemyamas, 43 Kwambis and
96 Windhoskers.

by others, the frequency of the
orchestrated aftacks against
Swapo has again increased of
late.

In the light of these accusa-
tions, Swapo of Namibia
demands that Phil ya Nangoloh
produces full names, addresses
and specific areas of ongin of
the following: the female ac
livist who went to Lubango:
the commander who was met
by this activist in Lubango; the

officials from the Ministry of
Education who met the ‘de- |

tainees' in Angola; the alleged
detainees referred to above and
the names of the rest of the 625
detainees he «claimed went
missing in Swapo detention as
per the updated list.

Swapo has undertaken to
make a preliminary report about
the sacrifices made dunng the
war in terms of human lives
and hopes that the report will
be available before the end of

this year. However, the proc- »

ess of searching for missing
persons will, like in any other
war, continue for a long time
to come.

Swapo of Namibia pro-
pounded the policy of national
reconciliation aimed at bring-
ing peace, political stability
and unity among our people
which are pre-requisites for

economic development.

However, clements in this
country who are faithful to their
sponsors continue to distort the
painful episode in the dark page
of the colonial history in this
country, hus impainng this
policy. Swapo will not allow
this to continue.

In conclusion we wish to
state that should Phil ya Nan-
goloh fail to produce the infor-
mation as outlined above,
Swapo will be forced to take
the appropnate action.

be careful that we do not create
a situation where privilege by
virtue of colour is replaced by
privilege by virtue of wealth
and whereby only the ‘haves’

enjoy the luxuries or creature
comforts while the ‘have-nots’
are forced to accept poverty as
their final destiny.

We who are govemed com-

a new person, with a new mind,

also believe that the hope for
Namubia does not just lie in a
political system or with a spe-
cific government. it lies with
us, the people, black and white,
who have come through the
crisis and have had to change.
We need new minds, new hearts
and new spints, hewn, as they
have been, from pain and
humiliation, from repentance
and forgiveness. Therefore we

we ourselves have not begun

i WOULD like to publish this
noble request in the name of

currently living heirs. May I
also have the privilege to shortly
dwell on the sad history of
Namibia. .

Numerous volumes have
been written on the treachery,
robbery, murder and ulti:

boasting generations here, were
the first, followed by the South
Africans. In the Present-day
independent Namibia the South |
African and German colonial- |
ists here, misusing the
constitution and its contents,
inter alia the socalled racon-
ciliation, are of the intent to |
manipulate the Land Confer-
ence in their favour.

main socalled iNamaland, the
Damaras were thrown away in
the barren western region, the
Hercros to the barren cast and
north-east. Let it be known to
those who don’t know or pre-

tend not to know that no amount
of money or political manoeu-
vering will stop the quest for
the regaining of our traditional
pastures.

We did not forget the past.
We shall never do so, We want
our land back. They never
bought it from us. They inter-
change money to our debit and
continued misery and poverty.
We are not asking for a fair
distribution of land. We want
it all back,

Why, Ms Editor, do you think
that the majority of Namasand
Damaras are the pooreat to-

day? Simply because they are
the most destitute people sinc}:

robbed?

Editor, if at all the Land
Conference wishes to achieve
peace, it has to address the
cardinal issues. There is no
way we are going to be talked
into improving current ‘home-
lands’. It is actually wrong to
talk of ‘homelands’, since the
whole of Namibia is OUR
homeland.

Reconciliation implies
wrongdoing. Wrongdoing
implies correcting the wrongs.
We cannot put the cart in frer
of the donkey. We have to start
at the beginning of the colonisa-
tion and end with the handing
over of Namibia to its rightful
owners, We are poor because
of the annihilation of land. How
can whoever expect us to raise
money where to raise money
with which to buy our land
back from whom?

Let us not be lured by the
forked tongues of land sharks.
They have no interest in Na-
mibia. Now is the time that
Namibia will be truly inde-
pendent, not only on paper but
in real jland ownership terms.

To those who are to attend
the Land Conference, know your
history and be solely guided
by it. We are all products of
our sad history, We are once
more in a new ora of
history for the gencratiatia to
coma.

My suggestion is that the

lt would be better if the

If we keep our soldiers busy

give us a good reputation with

the Cabinet of the Namibian

The policy of national rec-

still opposed to Namibia's
independence. Incidents of
racism frequently occur, espe-
cially in outlying areas, and in
my opinion the government has
_ been far too lenient in its ac-

This encouraged the reac-
tionary forces to continue
‘business as usual’; workers
are still victimised ‘tad exploited

remain untouched.

Social justice is a prerequi-

Your observation that our
decision to disaffiliate from

Swapo was shortsighted,
immature and irresponsible, is
a dogmatic approach that is
accompanied by a security
phobia and a serious lack of
analysis on the role of mass
organisations in #@ post-colo-
nial ora. You seem not to be a
democrat at all.

Nanso is opting for a disci-
plined working alliance with
parties who share common
programmes, objectives and
campaigns. Nanso cannot be
gpolitical in a political envi-
roament

Hence the need for etriking a
balance between the need for
strengthereng the organisation's
independent base on the one
hand, and the role Nanso will
have to play in our country’s
frestructunng of the economy
and the formulation of policies
on the other hand. Our impact
on the situation will depend on
our representation, unity and
strength on the ground.

Our most immediate task is
to mobilise and unite our stu-
dents. Majonty of our students
are unorganised. White schools
remain a challenge and some
students are in undemocratic
student bodies.

We want a Nanso that is
independent, democratic, ac-
countable and under control of

‘its members, not a Nanso that

is aconveyor belt for positions
or decisions of other organisa-
tions. Lastly we want to de-
velop our leadership and

Free or not

T WILL appreciate it if you
will allow me to share my
coacem in your newspaper
regarding housing and employ-
mem with my fellow Namibi-
ens who might have had the
, @ame experiences.
Everybody knows that
Nesubis is fro and yes, free-

dom is hero to stay, but some-
times it feels and looks as if we
are not free at all. There are
some sores circulation in our
town (Rundu) that houses for-
merly inhabited by whites only
will be handed over to the
Ministry of Works while those
houses in black arcas will re-
som under the control of the
Ministry of Local Government
and Housing. This meana that
black people wil! not be given
houses in the former white arca
and vice versa. Black families
currently living in this area are
subject to removal at any time
to look for their own housing
should the authority wish to do
so. If this is true, I think that
people are still boing treated
like trash in this region.

Benefits which were aimed
to help whites and other for-
cigners to ive a comfortable
life, such as the north package
for living in a war-torn area,
are stil! being received by whites
anly. This package covers utili-
ties like free water, free elec-
tncity, free gas, rent-free houses
and even pay just for being a
white person. Everyone in this
area knows about this, includ-
ing top govemment officials,
but they are not doing any-
thing about it.

Friends and relatives of the
housing commuttee, of which
the chaisperson is always white,
are enjoying prompt attention.
No white has ever becagivena
house in the not-so- well-built

j black reeidennal area and I have

never seen whiles suffer as
blacks do when i! comes to
housing.

Any white whocomesto the
region is given a house, while
blacks have to meet certain
requirements. Some single
whates live in big, rent-free
govemment houses while black
families are living in shanties
and caravans.

1 know that housing is a
national problem, but it is bad
tolet families live in the kitch-
ens of their relatives.

As far as employinent is
concemed, this goes hand-in-
land with uke availability of
houses, In Rundu houses are
reserved in case a person of
high rank is hired, while the
others do not have housing at
all. Whenover someone from

Windhock or elsewhere is
employed bere, capecially Lo
service of the government, a
house is sutomatically given
to that person, which is pot tho
case when someone from this
area is employed in Windhoek.

T know that this is done to
encourage people to accept
employmens in the sub-urban
and rural areas, but it looks
like people fram Windhoek are
deemed to be more important
than us. High-ranking jobe are
preferably given to those
coming from the capital, who
might not necessarily have
applied for them, instead of
people m the sub-urban and
rural areas who did apply. This
is an insult to our intelligence,
leadership qualities and our
ability to lead even on a re-
gional level. I am not saying
that we do not need people
from Windhoek, but we ahould
be considered on equal terms.
] know that Windhock is the
centre of everything, but let us
not undermmne, neglect or ig-
nore the potential and ability
of people living in the sub-
urban and rural arcas as was
done in the past.

My appeal to the govern-
ment is:

- to look seriously into the
matter of these unfair prac-
fces and cantinuous detumars-
sing treatment

- the government cannot, as
we know, build houses for
everyone, therefore it should
give low interest loans to the
people who build their own
houses. ] think this will alle vi-
ate the current housing prob-
lem while other altematives
are being explored.

- the Mimstry concemed with
hounng should spend time,
besides feeding street kids,
raising funds for building low
income houses all over Na-
mubia. These houses would
provide shelter and safe home
envirooment to street Inds once
adopted by the low income
families.

- the northem package should
stop with immediate effect
because there is no longer war
in this area and we should all
geta share. We fought to bring
justice and eradicate unfair
practicos in this country. A
quote from the late Martin
Luther King, saysitall: ‘Peace
does not mean the absence of
war, but the presence of jus-
tice’.

I WOULD like to refer to the
socalled revelations by Chief
Mamili published in The
Namibian entitled ‘The Mafwe
state their case’ on August 31.

If this revelation comes from
the Cinef himself then all peace
and freedom-loving Namibi-
ans should without hesitation
declare him the 1991 cham-
pion of tnbalism - for it ap-
pears he is unable to think
beyond the tnbe.

The point I would like to
make to Chief Mamuli and a
small section of the Mafwe
surrounding him 1s that the
cheapest colonisation method
used to colonise Namibia was
through the existence of tribes
- the championing of one tnbe
at the expense of others so as to
smoothly pave the way for the
bantustanisation of Namibia.

It is disappointing to leam
that Chief Mamili claims Ka-

tima Mulilo is a Mafwe area.

Capnvi knew no boundaries
even in the time of the coloni-
alists.

Why should we talk of tnbal
divisions and tribal bounda-
ries at this time? What are we
going to benefit from tribal
conflicts apart from rolling back
the progressive idea of national
reconciliation the ruling party
is keen to implement in order
to mould a healthy and pros-

_ perous nation?

the will of the inhabitants. If
the socalled revelation came
from Chief Mamili directly,
then he should apologise to the
Namibian nation for the in-
converences provoked by the
violent. demonstration and the
subsequent damage to peace
and nation-building.

The prefabricated allegation
that the recently appointed
people in the Ministry of Edu-
cation are unqualified, is a case
of character assassination and
if | were them, ! would take
you to court.

If Chief Mamili is a real
cluef as he claims, he should
stop listening to Mishake
Muyongo who wants to ac-
complish his political ambi-
uions of divide and rule.

In this patriotic process of
moulding a nation, the concept
of championing tribalism should
be looked at as a political lia-
bility that is detrimental to
nation-building. Caprivi as an

longsto all Namibiansand still

Remember
Simbwaye
HONOUR should be given to

the former Vice President of
Swapo, Brendan Simbwaye,

who disappeared 28 years ago. —

It was late moming of March
1964 in Katima Mulilo when

the news spread into the vil- —

lages that Simbwaye was kid- —

napped at gunpoint from the
local prison by the SA Police.

He appears to be forgotten
on the political map. He fell

_ victim to the police after ad-

dressing a rally at Mapulo, today
known as Ngwezi. During the
incident, 16 people were
wounded. | :
His disappearance did not
stop the fight for freedom and
independence, but rather sharp-
ened the struggle in that area.
Thousands of Caprivians are
still asking themselves what
the police did with their brother.
Simbwaye’s death is highly
spoken of by many in the area
as a great loss, not only to
Namibians who knew him but
many who had heard of him.
While in office the SA Po-
lice showed Caprivians that the
best way to do away with an
order fighting for independ-
ence was to arrest, torture,
intimidate, and put injail those
‘who were. active in the
struggle. . |

On Walvis Bay

An open letter to
UN Secretary General
Dr Boutros Boutros Gali

IN VIEW of Namibia’s sec-
ond anniversary of independ-
ence, I would like to express
my deservedly deep concer
about parts of our country still
under foreign domination.

Writing straight to you proba-

bly reveals my ignorance re-
garding the ‘correct method’
of communicating with you.
However, deliberate depriva-
tion and annihilation during
the tragic colonial era would
justify my shortcomings. No
wonder, Namibia’s current
more than 50 per cent illiter-
acy rate. 7

Nowhere in the world, at
of Nations and subsequently
the United Nations’ existence,
were more resolutions passed,
defied, overlooked and/or for-
gotten than in the world body’s
former ‘baby’ for which it had

responsibility,

The long colonial years di-
lapidated both Namibia’s un-
renewable natural and human

Kher parts of the world are

still paying reparations to each
other after the two world wars.
Regardless of her plunder at
the expense of growth, pro-
duction, literacy and self-suf-
ficiency, Namibia has her sec-
ond anniversary of sovereignty
in debt and heavily dependent
upon imports.

Worse still, more than 90
per cent of her imported com-
modities are handled in Walvis
Bay, her only deepwater port.
Unfortunately, to our detriment,
Walvis Bay is apparently still
considered as part of South
Africa. Twelve, if not more of
Namibia’s offshore islands are
also still under South African
control, thus effectively reduc-
ing the area covered by the
country’s offshore rights by
about one-fifth.

If part of the world body’s _
responsibilities is to safeguard
peace, security, self-determi-
nation of member states: and
observation of good faith and
overwhelming justice towards
all nations, then Namibia de-
serves its long-violated rights
and national integrity honoured.
I therefore, on behalf of the
Namibian people, request your
organistion to ensure that jus-
tice prevails and that Walvis
Bay and the offshore islands
are retumed to the authentic
control of the indigenous popu-
lation - the Namibian people. I
should be grateful to see the
new world order incorporating
all parts of this fragile world.

Enemy of peace

AS a patnot and a democrat, I

would like to respond to Dr
Petrus J Krige’s letter which
appeared in The Namibian on
April 3.

First I would like to miake it
clear that the policy of na-
tional reconciliation was unani-
mously declared asa national
policy and not only the Presi-

tions have to make sure that
the policy goes deep into the
roots of this country and is
clearly understood by all citi-
zens. This is the task of every
Namibian. For that matter, Dr
Knge is not only against the
prevailing atmosphere in this
country, but he is also against

its independence, as such he is

an enemy of peace and justice.

There is no one in this coun-
try who would support his line,
except perhaps a few friends
who are suffering from the same
disease.

When we talk about recon-
ciliation, we mean business,
and we do not judge people by
colour, sex, political affiliation,
ideological differences or be-

liefs.
Tt is untrue to say that the

Government of Namibia does
not allow judges and sport
participants from South Af-
rica while it allows imports
from the same country. I think
you are joking, and are obvi-
ously not a Namibian. If you
""are, then you don’t need to get
a job, but re-orientation and
' attend lectures to familiarise
yourself with what is happen’
- ing in Namibia. You must be
the first ignorant intellectual
in Namibia.

Regarding culture, the Gov-
ernment of Namibia is ademo-
cratic one, and I can assure you
that it doesn’t limit rights and
freedoms as you maintain.
Everyone has the nght to en-
joy his or her cultural hentage
provided that this is in keeping
with article 19 of the
Constitution of Namibia.

I think that his theory is
misleading, if not inciting hatred
among Namibians. Since you
are a doctor in musicology,
maybe you need a medical
doctor to cure you of the dis-
ease called a superiority com-
plex and your racism. It is a
pity we still have people in this
country who are anti-progress

dent or Government institu- .

and anti-nation building.

Are you also saying that
Namibians are unable to do
administrative work? And are
you saying that Namubians
should not be appointed to high
positions? I believe that all
Namibians, irrespective of
colour, should have equal
opportunities and be able to
run state machinery. Don’t
underestimate the abilities of
Namibian people, sir. It is not
only foreigners who can do
these jobs.

Neither should you insult our
national anthem. ‘Freedom
fight’ has no undesirable or
negative connotations. It is only
your ignorant, anti-democratic
and racist sentiments. Who are
the Namibians who live inside
the country who don’t share
the same sentiment regarding
this? You are an autocrat and
cannot talk on behalf of demo-
crats. Who gave you the man-
date to do so?

I don’t think you can pre-
tend not to know why Swapo
opted for the armed struggle.
There is hardly anyone, even
non-citizens of this country,
who do not know. this.

You are not only against
Swapo as the ruling party, but

also against the Namibian

people. You do not even honour
people who sacrificed their lives
for the cause of this country
and now you want to be given
a job, probably as a director,
because you think you are the
best and only musicologist in
this country.

I feel sorry for you sir. Be-

sides musicology, you appear
to be totally empty politically.
National reconciliation is our
policy and if you don’t like it
you should go to a place where
there is no peace and justice,
since you want the policy tobe
reversed. Think twice, sir, and
learn from your mistakes.

IT IS not easy to work at

have been

ONCE upon a time there was
acountry in Afncacalled Ba-
sibia. Basibia had a small
population. Most of its people
were peor in terms of money
but nch in spirit.

For many years Basibia was
tuled by a colonia: power.
The officials in the colonial
government paid themselves
high salaries while the people
starved, robbing Basibia of
its wealth for their own bene-
fit. But the people of Basibia
were suong. For many years
they fought against colonial
tule under BAPPA, the Ba-
sibian Peoples Party. After a
long and painful struggle,
Bastbia finally won its inde-
pendence. Now the Basibian
people were free to shape their
own nation.

“Now we can be just like
other nations in Africa”, said
some of the people. “Oh no”,
said others, “we must learn
from our brothers and sisters.
We will follow ther successes
and avoid their mistakes”.

Basibia adopted a
consbtrution that was admired
all over the world because it
made Basibia a true democ-
racy.

BAPPA swept to victory in
Basibia’s first election as an
independent nation because
it promised to live up to its
name as a people’s party. Its
election posters said ‘United
We Stand, Divided We Fall’
and ‘Build a New Basibia for
all Basibians’.

The leader of BAPPA be-
came the first President of
Basibia. He loved the people
of Basibia and was much loved
by them.

“We are all Basibians to-
gether”, he said. “Every man,
woman and child in this na-
tion is my family, and I will
not rest while any of ny people
are suffering”.

“That is fine”, said some of
the members of BAPPA, ‘but
now we must talk about our
salaries. To keep the peace,
we have promised all the gov-
emmment employees who were
hired before independence that
their salaries will not be re-
duced. So we must pay our-
selves at least as much as
they are getting, of perhaps
even more”.

“No”, said the President
“those people were robbing
our country. Why should we
follow in their footsteps? Be-
cause we work for the gov-
emment, we are given houses
to live in while many of our
people are homeless. The state
even gives us pensions and
medical aid. We will pay
ourse!ves modest salaries. And
I have State House to live in
and a government Car to travel
in - I will be well taken care
of. My salary must be the
lowest of all”.

“But, Comrade President”,
the others cried, “you can’t
do that. You are the father of
the nation. Surely your salary
must be the highest. No leader
of any other country would
do such a thing”. .

And the President replied
“You say that [ am the father
of ous nation - what father

the world!”

The neat day some of the
President's advisors came to
talk to him about cars for the
government. “Of course,
Benz's”, they said. “The Ba-
sibian people would like to
see us in cars that will suit our
status as leaders”.

“No”, said the President, ‘I
do not think so. We willneed
transport, but we must save
as much money as possible
for developing our nation. No
one working in this govern-
ment is going to drive a fancy
car”.

“But Comrade President”,
they said, “all the highest
government officials before
independence drove expen-
sive cars. And so do Heads of
State all over the world!”

“Yes”, said the President

“but we will be different. We
will set an example. A true
leader does not separate
himself from the people. You
must remember that most of
the people of Basibia cannot
afford a car at all. Find us
some inexpensive cars that
will get us where we need to
go”.
“Now, Comrade President’,
said the advisors, “we need to
build a new place for Parlia-
ment to meet”

“But why?”, said the Presi-
dent. ‘Is there no place where
we can gather to do our work?’

“Yes”, they said, “but it is
old and dingy and we will be
crowded there. We want a
fancy room with a new carpet
and leather chairs”.

“No”, said the President, ‘1
will not spend any money on
government buildings until
every single person in our
nation has a home to live in.
Until thatday, we must get by
with what we have”.

The next day the President's
advisors were back again.
“Comrade President”, they
said, ‘we will have to make
many trips to other counmes.
We must share ideas and
discuss issues and make agree-
ments with the people of other
nations”.

“This is true”, said the Presi-
dent, ‘we moust do some tav-
elling. But we must always
think of saving money. None
of my ministers will fy first
class, and we will always stay
in the cheapest hotels”.

“But Comrade President”,
they said, ‘‘a government min-
ister must travel in style. You
would not want your minis-
ters to be crowded and un-
comfortable”.

And the President said “how
can you talk about being
crowded and uncomfortable
when I have seen some of our
people living in the single
quarters, 10 and 20 people
sleeping in one tiny room,
every night of their lives?”

“But what about you, com-
rade President?”, they said,
“you must have your own
plane for efficiency and secu-

simplest plane that can take
moe where I need to go. A true

leader does not separate
himself from the people. We
are going to set an example to
the world”.

It was not long before a
delegation came from Parlia-
ment to visit the President.
“Comrade President’, they
said, ‘this cannot continue.
We are Basibia’s leaders. We
fought for independence and
now we deserve our reward”.

“Yes”, said the President,
“but we did not fight alone.
Would any of us be here in
government today if we had
not had the support of our
people? All Basibians deserve
the reward of a new Basibia
where all can prosper”.

“But, comrade President”,
they said, ‘‘no other country
in the world operates this way.
We will be the laughingstock
of Afnca”.

“No”, said the President, “T
think you are going to be sur-
prised”.

And it was not long before
anew spirit came to Basibia -
a spint of giving and sharing.
Government ministnes held
competitions to see which ones
could save the most moncy.
Some of the civil servants who
had been hired before inde-
pendence were so embarrassed
about their high salaries that
they asked for salary cuts.
Even private citizens sold their
fancy cars because it was so
unfashionable to be seen in
them.

And the government spent
money on health care and
education and literacy train-
ing and development projects
and social security payments
for the old and unemployed.
It was not long before the
standard of living of every
single person in Basibia had
risen. No one was hungry.
Children were healthier.
Everyone in Basibia had a
home, and almost everyone
could read. And the govern-
ment had been so careful with
its money that Basibia was
not dependent on foreign aid.
Basibia was truly free.

The Presiden: was respected
and admired more than any
other leader in any country in
the history of the world. Alt
over Basibia people said “A
true leader does not separate
himself from the people”. They
voted for BAPPA again and
again, and Basibia remained
peaceful and prosperous.

And soon Basibia was fa-
mous. No other nation had
ever dared to be so different.
Visitors came streaming in
from all over the world to sce
this remarkable place. New
investors were attracted [0
Basibia because it was SO
unique. People in every land
recognised the wisdom of the
President of Basibia and he
was awarded many honours
(which he always accepted in
the name of all Basibians).

Basibians had once said
“We must be like all other
countries”. Now people in

ae abe aoe ree

othercountries said ‘‘we want
to be like Basibia”’.

And that is how one small
nation began to change the
world

ANON

The jet outcry

IT has never been part of my
culture to engage myself in
public debates which are being
over-emphasised for political
gain.

In the face of the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an R80 mil-
lion jet for the Government
and officials of the Republic
of Namibia, I was faced with
several questions which I could
not help to answer.

I fully concur with the fact
that our country faces oumer-
ous problems, some short term
and others long term. Take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane.

Now the queston is whether
it is true that those ‘Muyon-
gos’ who presuppose that the
R80 million could have been
better spent if used for rehef

programmes, are more sensi-
tive to the realities in Na-

mibia? If so, how far back
have they (Muyongos) been
$0 critical about the way in
which taxpayers’ money has
been spent for the purchase
of things such as Casspirs and
Mirages by their regime, the
former interim government?

Or, does Muyongo wantus
to believe that the money mis-
used on the purchase of war
material at the ume of their
rule was less than R80 mil-
lion? And was it not taxpay-
ers’ money?

This country has inherited
a debt which it has to repay
due to the misuse of funds
and the criminal war which
was imposed on our people.
Again, does Muyongo want
us to accept that the drought
and other social evils in our
country today are new hap-
penings? I assume not.

Unemployment, hunger, to
mention but a few, are the
legacy of the past history of
the country. Even at the time
of successive colonial regimes,
the problems were there.

As these problems did not
prevent them (the Muyongos)
from purchasing wanton war
materials which ran to bil-
lions of Rands which this
country is left to repay today,
likewise, should these pre-
vent the legitimate govemn-
ment from purchasing a plane
which will enable the Presi-
dent and other Government
officials to maintain contacts
with the outside world for the
benefit of the people of this
country?

purchased, could there be

t is Surprising that th

e

Government and specially
the Office Of the Prime Min-
ister is Prepared to Mislead
Public opinion by appointing
someone tO investigate the
acquisition of land by only
three people and especially
in the communal!

areas. That
office being responsible for

Conference, recommenda-

tions could have started there
to solve the national issue of

Itis also surprising that the
Government, whenever it talks
of the legal or rightful acqui-
sition of land, only concen-
trates on communal land. Let
it be stated here categorically
Clearly that we the Namibian
people, and especially those
of us who laboriously fought
to return back our stolen land,
did so for the whole of Na-
mibia including the socalled
commercial farmland.

Lasting peace and stability

in this country could only come
if equitable distribution of land
is done now and not later. The
question of senior officials
acquiring land only demon-
Strates to us that people are
hungry for land. If senior of-
ficials have the means of us-
ing their official positions to
acquire the land, the mass of
our people who on numerous
occasions have demonstrated
publicly to have the land ques-
tion settled, may one day take
up arms to revoke the present
status quo as far as land own-
ership is concerned.

It is hurtful to note that the
land price is artificially made
to be exhorbitantly high to
benefit those who forcefully
took control of our people
and ownership of our land.
Once cannot accept that in
Windhoek it is practically im-
possible to buy a piece of
land to build a dwelling.

So, Mr Prime Minister, we
the silent majority, who fought
for the liberation of this coun-
try and suffered imprisonment
and detention for the libera-
tion of this country, who dem-
onstrated fearlessly in the
streets of Windhoek, Katu-
tura, mines, schools, did so to
ensure that Namibia is free.
We who voted the Swapo gov-
emment to power want our
land NOW. We expect you
urgently to implement the Land
Conference recommenda-

If this Suggestion is not
workable, may I ask the Gov-
¢mment to put the question to
the electorate during regional
elections which are due be-

fore the end of the year. I
think that the verdict of the

majority of people is neces-
sary. My verdict is that we
are being held hostage by an
unpatriotic few who think of
Namibia in terms of their own
benefit alone and who through
their access are misleading
public opinion. Commercial
farms are not touched now,
butare they able torespond to
the urgent need for food in
this country? I am pretty sure
and convinced that if access —
to land was easy, the effect of
the present natural calamity
would not be the same. Be-
Cause more people could have
engaged in food production.

I want to point out that the
Namibian food market is rela-
tively stable because the pres-
sure is reduced by the com-
munal land which provided
71 per cent of the livelihood
of the inhabitants of those
areas. Now the population of
both animals and people is
increasing, and the ecology
has taken its toll because of
the way in which the land has
been over-utilised. The logi-
cal solution is therefore the
urgent need to solve this
question. We want our land
back.

On Earth Summit

THE Earth Summit presently
being held in Brazil once again
highlights the precarious po-
sition Planet Earth finds itself
in because of the short-sighted,
profit-oriented exploitation of
its natural resources.

It also shows that if man
has learned anything from
history, it is the fact that man
never seems to learn from
history. ,

Take, for instance, the av-
erage citizen's matter-of-fact

‘attitude towards the environ-
ment, especially in our still
developing, relatively non-
industrialised country.

We need just look at the
severe problems being expe-
rienced by the socalled de-

A FEW days from now, *
Namibians from all w
of life will commemorate
Heroes Day on August 26.
Significantly this 1s 4
remarkable day, because of
the nature of the liberation
activities which occurred on
that day between the indige-
nous brave sons and dau gh-
ters of this country and the
then colonial forces al
Ongulumbashe in the north-
ern part of the country.
Those liberation activities
germinated or brought about
national independence and
democracy. It has been a
_ bitter struggle as it was
| depicted by the Honourable .
Minister and veteran politi-
cian Andimba Toivo ya
Toivo during his political
trial.

It was a life or death situ-
ation but despite that, the
Namibian people under their
then vanguard liberation
movement Swapo fought
heroically and pledged or
vowed not to stop their
struggle until all colonial
evils were buried and genu-
ine national independence
based on the concept of
democracy was achieved.

“On 21 March 1990, the
+ pledge of the Namibian
mi people became areality and

etually placed our country

It is very dehumanising
and an unbelievable situ-
ation to always see the he-
roes and heroines of our
country running round the
streets of Windhoek and
other major cities without
work, when in practice the
position which they rightly
deserve and are qualified to
do are being occupied by
foreigners.

Practically speaking, the

| labour situation in an inde-
pendent Republic of Na-
mibia shows that, cowards
who fought in defence of
injustice and colonialism are
today the people enjoying
the fruits of braveness.
Apart from those who have
sacrificed their lives for
national - independence, |
democracy and justice to

and whether there 1s any

differences politically, eco-
nomically and socially.

Since our constitution
guarantees job opportuni-
ties for those who served in
the then colonial admini-
stration, it would augur well
for progress if our
constitution writers would
have dealt with the future
plight of the Plan freedom
fighters in depth.

A distinctive law or act
should have been put in place
to differentiate between the
nationalist fighters, the he-

Who are heroes?
_ ONE difficult question

air their views on a Ta- |

Some names were
mentioned of those
considered to be heroes,
like Chiefs Hendrik
Wilbooi, Mandume
Ndemufao, King Nehale
Mpingana, Jacob Mar-
enga, some mentioned
Frankie Fredericks and
others asked whether
German Govermor Leut-

wein should be a hero,
Or President Sam

Nujoma?

As far as 1 am con-
cerned this question still
needs an answer.

Before this issue was
debated I had already
some interest in the topic
and was trying to gather
information for an edu-
cation poster on heroes
of Namibia, which is still
pending, as the question
remains unresolved.

As a histonan I was
asked to idenufy Namib-
ian heroes, and the aim
of the poster 1s to help or
guide teachers at schools
as to how they could
include this topic in their
syllabus.

Swapo and

IT is rather shameful and |

the unfortunate situation

The recent eruption of

us, the youth of Swapo

unequivocally clear
where we stand on the
cnsis. The Unita ban-
dats were clearly defeated
in the elections - the UN
cerufied that and any
chspute should be settled
peacefully.

Frankly, our silence
may be tantamount to a

_ | betrayal of our bond of

fmendship that ' Bxust
‘ between Swapo and the

MPLA. Angola, of all
countnies, deserves our
unreserved .

I do not need to re-

a word of solidarity and
condemn the bandits for
resuming the civil war.

At least a token of

could be due to several

the ethics and responsi-
bilities that govern our
profession or calling.

It is against this beck-
ground that I congratu-
late the office of the
Prime Minister and the
Prime Minister himself
for having organised and
addressed the recent in-
formative and educa-
tional workshop for per-
manent secretaries. This
was democracy in action.

The Prime Minister
spoke of assessment of
public feelings. This is
an important point, but
how can one assess peo-
ple’s feelings if one has
adopted the concept of
being exclusive? It ts
through socialisauion that
one can effectively as-
sess the staff and the gen-
cral public's feelings to-
wards one's perform-
ances.

As civil servants we
should always remember
that whatcver we say, do,
and whatever our objec:
tives arc, it is the civil
service unity of action
which make up the chain
of development and if
one of the staff break
down in terms of think-
ing, initiative and crea-
tivity, in spite of the
strength of other remain-
ing members of the chain,
this chain will cease to
be active.

According to E M
Debrah, ‘civil servants
are highly respected per-
sons who at all umes are
supposed to exhidil a:
sense of dedication to
their duties and absolute
respect for the rules’.

Civil servants are the
ambassadors and mirrors
from which the image
and wishes and aspira-
tions of the government
and the people of the
country are reflected.

[1 is imperative to say
that the concept of being
exclusive, indecisive,
dismissive, rude and im-
polite is incompatible
with democracy, peace,

and a healthy
working relationship.
There is therefore, a need
for more seminars simi-
lar to that held at Gross
Barmen. We have much
to lear in terms of indi-
vidual commitment, a-
oa ity, reaponsibil-
ve and loyalty.

ALLOW me to express the feelings of ruling party
members in your newspaper. We in Swapo are
committed to democratic principles and therefore
Swapo is calling on registered voters to exercise
their democratic rights to vote in the coming general
elections.

We are not campaigning for a two-thirds majority
but for the overwhelming majority to rule this
country. It is not a secret that we are ruling, and we
have and will continue to rule Namibia according to
the democratic structures put in place by Swapo.

We in Swapo believe and know that democracy
will stay forever in this country.

Other parties have often relied on tribalism and
racism to promote their cause and they therefore can
claim to represent Namibia as a whole. It should
therefore be a wonder that Swapo has provided four
and ahalf years of peace and tranquility in Namibia.

We live in peace today because of the commit-
ment of Swapo to seek unity in diversity in our
country.

In spite of the fact that some opposition parties
have insulted S wapo leaders personally, itis Swapo’s
leadership and maturity that has never wavered
from the commitment to freedom of speech.

In the past years Swapo has committed itself to

nation-building, knowing that Namibians deservea
government that has priorities as they do. The
Swapo leadership has ensured development and
they also believe there must be contact between
government and people at all levels. That is why
Swapo has branches and sections at grassroots
level.

The Foreign Investment Act was passed, which
regulates the framework for foreign investors. In-
come tax was reduced twice. Job creation was one
of the top priorities.

In the next five years Swapo’s priority will be to
secure existing jobs and create new oncs. For exam-
ple the Free Trade Zone will create more jobs for
Namibians and that is part of Swapo’s priorities for
the next five years.

Tourism will be expanded and housing, water,
electricity, education, health, agriculture and fish-
eries will be promoted.

Therefore in the next five years Swapo will accel-
erate change by creating new opportunities for
Namibians through economic growth, better educa-
tion and health services and more jobs.

questions as to whether Swapo has
fulfilled the promises it made in 1989
an how many people have used the
Falcon jet?

Of course Swapo fulfilled its prom-
ises. We are now living in better hous-
ing, have better communication fa-
cilities, better education, better
healthcare and Swapo has also re-
duced the unemployment rate. We are
now living in peace, no more
‘makakunyas’ destroying our maize
fields and beating up people and
Swapo has buried apartheid forever.

With regard the jet, how many peo-

ple does Mr Muyongo feel should
have used it? Does he went everyone
to use it? The Falcon is not a taxi but

transport for the President and his Min- _

isters. :

I strongly believe people will not
vote DTA. and that they will lose the
forthcoming elections with no single
seat in Parliament.

President Nujoma should not con-
cern himself about the DTA in the
coming elections. Swapo will make
sure he rules this country for the rest of

EMBASSY of the Isiamic Re-
public of Iran has the honour
torefer toan article published
in your newspaper of Jnauary
5 1995, page 11, entitled: ‘Iran
heads for the bomb’, and has
the following tosay in response
to this article.

|. As far as the Iranian Atomic
Technology is concerned, it was
never meant for threatning coun-
tries in the region, but it is only
meant for peaceful purposes and

economic development of the
Islamic Republic of Iran.

2. The Zionist regime has the
maximum budget for purchase
and production of deadly mass
destruction weapons like the
nuclear bomb, and is in fact the
only country which is a major
threat in the region, as far as
deadly mass destruction weap-
ons are concerned.

3. However, Israel never al-
lowed any of the experts from
the International Atomic En-
ergy Agency to inspect any of

its atomic energy installations,
whereas the Iranian atomic en-
ergy installations were in-
spected by these experts who

confirmed the peaceful aim of

the Iranian nuclear production.

4, Islamic Republic of Iran ts
a member of the NPT (Non-
Proliferation Treaty) agreenient
and the Government of the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran is fully
committed to this agreement.
But the Zionist regime ts nota
member of this agreement and
they never signed the agrcc-
ment. All the neighbouring
countries of Isareal are being

threatened by the Zionist regime’s
nuclear activity which is against
peace, stability and security in
the region.

5. The USA and Isracl now has
the plan to draw big negative pic-
tures about the Islamic Republic
of Iran's peaceful nuclear activ-
ity, inorder to frighten the neigh-
bouring countries in the region,
sothatthey can sell military weap-
ons and equipment to rich Persian
Gulf countries.

Says Local Historian

HAVE you been to the Alte Feste
lately? If you have, then there is no
need to convince you that the claim of
Carol Kotze made in The Windhoek
Advertiscrof January 13 about “empty
rooms’ isa product of ill imagination.
Ifthe colleague knew what a muscum
is all about, her capectations could
have been different.

According to the International
Council of Muscunis: “A museumis a
non-profit making, permanent inst-
tuvion in the service of society and its
development, and open to the public,
whichacquires, conserves, rescarches,
communicates and cahibits, for pur-
pose of study, education and enjoy -
ment, material evidence of people
and their environment’.

Therefore, a museum ts a cultural
institution of national significance
whose goals reach far beyond mere
the entertaining of tourists. And atter
all. Ms Carol Kotze has no mandate to
speak for the tourist, or does she feel
like a tourist in her own country?

The muscuni's visitors book of im-
pressions of what she Called ‘tacky’
cahibition (Our Namibian Heroes) at

Alte Feste, includes the opinion of
foreign tourists and Nanibians alike.
It speaks for itself, Just to mention a
few of the remarks most often used
over the last tour months: Eaxcellen’
Very Eaccllent/Superb/Fabulous.
These are comments of 38 visitors of
which 24 are Namibian, 6 from RSA,
3 from USA, 2 trom Norway, | from
Denmark and 2 from Germany.

Nice/Very Nice/Beauliful came
from 16 visitors: OK fron 10 visitors:
Interesting/Very Interesting came
from 31 visitors; Thank-you from 7
visitors: Informative/Very Informa-
tive/Educational came from 15 visi-
tors. [tis impossible to mention all the
different cncouraging words in the
book. but the positive remarks are
certainly a genuine indication of the
role of the muscum in nation-build-
ing and atruc reward for any muscum
professionals.

I would advise Ms Kotze, whose
blood pressure apparently rises atthe
sight of muscum eshibitions, to seek
imnmicdiate medical help before she
has aheart attack, for independence is
here to stay and so is the historical
efleciivn. of Che daberatian. struggle

which brought about this independ-
ence.

And if someone's head ‘drops in

facts revealed in the Alte Feste dis-
plays *sinee independence’, then obvi-
ously he/she is against the struggle.

wrote inthe visitor's book the ambigu-
ous: “History has many facts’. Indeed
history has many facts and many tronic
Iwists too, An ancient Roman apho-
rism says: “When the facts speak, even
the gods keep quiet’.

As to Ms Kotze’s concem about
altracting tourists and ‘evestors to
Namibia. distortion and silence over
historical facts will not do the job. This
kind of approach transpired in “her

which outraged teachers, pupils and

Tourists are not a bunch of fools, to
whonrone can sell cheap colonial myths

ofthe German Schutztruppe whocame
from Europe to “bring peace anvong
the rivalling Nama and Herero’ as all
the present monuments. in, Namibia
hypocritically record. © - 4.

It ts evident, trom the litue unpro-
vised museum survey, that the tourists
are interested to know the truth about
Namibian history. Thus, they will be
able to appreciate the real dimensions
of national reconciliation today and
the moral and political generosity of
the Namibian people - a colourful co-
hesion of national characters who
emerged victorious as a nation froma
difficult past. As far as foreign inves-
tors are concerned, they are not invest-
ing in the history, but in the peaceful
and stable present of Namibia and in
the hope for a brighter future, and the
price for today’s peace and stability
was heavily paid in the past.

Thatis why there isa saying thata
Nation Without a past has no future
either.

THE President hay recently been at-
tacked in the media tor visiting Nigena
and above all for mv :ting General Sani
Abacha to visit Namibia. Those who
criticived this action have every nght to
exercise their freedom of speech. How-
ever, J find the reasons they advanced
in condemning the President's acuons
to be invalid, profoundly immature. ir-
rational and highly misleading. Also
these critics manifest a dangerous len-
dency of intolerance which is not healthy
for the survival of democracy.
Whenever there is a conflict or dis-
pute it is better to attempt to solve it
through peaceful means, starting with
dialogue. President Nujoma is very
much conversant with this principle.

Therefore, when Dr Buthelezi ob- agg

structed peace in South Africa he talked
to him: in the same vein he extended an
invitation t@ Dr Savimbi of Unita to
come to Windhoek to discuss the prob-
lems and peace in Angola. Also, when
South Africa was a panah state, pro-
gressive people all over the world, m-
cluding victims of its policies, remained
ready to talk and listen. It is therefore
wrong to condemn statesmen who ini-
tiate dialogue with General Abacha.
The fact that President Nuyoma is
willing to associate with him should
not be seen as demonstrauve of support
for the latter’s regime: it should instead
be seen as an attempt to help Nigeria

return to democracy.

tsolating General Abacha when he is
willing to assoc tale with democrats will
only encourage him to contunue violal-
ing peace in Nigena and strengthen his

undemocranc methods of govesmment.

Mr Groth, if people are saying that some of those
who tortured people in Angola and Zambia are in
parliament, what about those who were against
Swapo? Some of them commanded squads to kill
Swapo members, but they are also in the Partia-
ment, police, defence force and some even hold the
higher ranks.

Talking about spies.

Mr Groth, I, who am writing this letter, was a
Swapo member during the struggle. I was beaten
many times and shot at with rubber bullets. They
really did send spies to Swapo camps.

I was approached by a certain cop at that time a
lieutenant but now holding a higher rank. He
wanted me to betray my fellow members by pre-
tending that I also wanted to go into exile. I was to
fetch him the day the people would leave so that
they could capture them. I refused. I could not do
that to my fellow Namibians.

He came to me again and this time he wanted me
to goto Angola, gain information, escape and come
back to tell them the plans, where the camps were
and many things I can’t mention. I still refused and
after that 1 was watched like hell.

Mr Groth, there is a fot you don’t know. Start
writing a book about the other side, things mustn't
be seen from one side only. Only both sides can
clean the wounds.

Swapo won the war and they didn’t take revenge.

they asked for peace, fogiveness and to
Teconcile. Is that too much to ask?

When people came back from exile they were
full of bitterness and hatred and wanted revenge,
but the President told them not to go ahead but to
forgive even though we remember and will never
forget.

If you want toknow about those who disappeared
and were tortured by Swapo, why should the DTA
not do the same? Let both sides do the same. It is
ota one-sided story.

also because of the Government.

Nam Needs To Develop 4
National Consciousness (

NATIONAL consciousness transforms the pre
political, societal and cultural system and we have ,
the power and right to make of it what we Wish 4
Such a major understanding can only be realised in,
an atmosphere where people are convinced of the -
truth and it is inherent in their stand, ,

The exploitative attitude of Colonisers has !
throughout history resulted in nothing Sinis-
ter than mere cultural or geographical fusion at
worst, or language bastardisation at best. It ig true
that the history of weaker nations are Shaped by
those of larger nations. On the other hand,
weaker nations continue to be exploited and subse.
quently many independent African Nations fail to
attain real independence. The most important
weapon for this is our mind. People are becoming
more and more conscious of the self.

National Consciousness and its Spread in Namibia
has to work against a number of factors. Firstly,
there are the traditional complexities and then the
emptiness of the native’s past.

As Fanon puts it, “The consciousness of the self
is not the closing of a door to communication”,
National consciousness, which is not nationalism,
is the only thing that will give us an international
dimension.

Namibia must unite to foster peace and h
in our country. We should not divide because of
our differences, but appreciate them and build og
the diversity of our culture. Our youth especially
Should accept their responsibility towards each othy
and our society as a whole and. not dwell on the -
wrongs of the colonial era. This will only prove a
hindrance to our Progress towards peace, prosper-
ity and a sane society. We need to give democracy
and reconciliation a chance. If we do not reorientate
ourselves the idea of reconciliation will Surely fail.

19971003a,19971003,peace,Peace.19971003a_page_1.txt,1,"Garoeb, History & Human Rights

BECAUSE ot the high regard the BWS (Breaking the Wall of
Stlence) has for family of the late Moses Garoeb, we decided
to reserve our comment on his life until after the funeral.
Garocb was given a full state funeral with a 21-gun salute.
preceded by a public holiday. Flags Nlew at half mast for& days.
A memonal service was held at Parliament Gardens. BWS
followed the events with great interest.

History has a special place for any person who has been given

a special responsibility ata given time. The yardstick being
used is how that person has related to human nights. Garoeb
was given a key position of administrative secretary of Swapo
in exile, which he occupied for 18 years. The Period between
1977 and 1989 can best be described as the cra of terror and fear
amongst Namibians in exile. Upon his return to Namibia, he
was given a key position of Swapo Secretary General. When
Namibian history puts Garoeb in his proper place in its annals,
itwill seriously take the details of the two periods into account.

After all the nice words have been said and all formal
statements have had their day, the crucial question has sull to
be asked. “Where shall history rightfully place Moses Garoeb
when the whole truth is told of how Namibians have lived in
exile, particularly in Zambia and Angola, and when issues of
honesty and human rights are taken into account?”

Moses Garoeb was brutally frank and frankly brutal, contra-
dictory, a demagogue who sought fulfilment in hurting fecl-
ings and hate speeches. In 1977 during the so called Shipanga
Crisis in Zambia, Garoeb went to Mboroma concentration
camp and succeeded to lure hundreds of the dissident combat-
ants back to Swapo, many of whom had disappeared soon
thereafter. Under his administration Swapo had climinated
hundreds of its followers in Angola and kept others in the
dungeons without even the host Government suspecting any-
thing, let alone the international community. When the world
Lutherans had started to raise some probi

exemplary private life and Garoeb had not been a good role
model in this regard.

When the UN Resolution 435 was about to the implemented,
with the demand that both South Africa and Swapo should first
release their captives, Garoeb went quickly to Lubango, gath-
ered the detainces from the different dungeons and threatened
that if they would reveal that they were detained by Swapo,
Swapo would deal with them in Namibia. At the same occasion
he “promised” them that they would carry the stigma of being
called South African spics for the rest of their lives.

Last year when some Namibians had started to organise
themselves into BWS to bring into the open the dark side of our
independence struggle. Garocb called upon Swapo members
countrywide to prepare for “civil war”.

In hife Garoeb had carried a lot of secret information crucial
to BWS work. It scems he has gone to his grave with this
information locked up in his heart. For the sake of history, BWS
Ws cagerly interested to hear what Garoeb had said about the
whole detainee saga during his last days of life. BWS had
capected that he might invite some of the Lubango dungeon
survivors to his sick bed but this seems not to have happened.

We all know that it was a gross political blunder and sheer
shortsightedness when last year Garoeb tried to publicly belittle
the Council of Churches in Nanubia. IUwas really moving to sec
that during the funeral service his body was consecrated and
committed back to dust by the man he once so scormfully
characterised as a“ non-entity”. However. inthe context of truth,
reconcthation and peace. Garocb had Icft us with a very impor-
tant theological question: “What will you do if f tell you that I
had killed your brother?” He asked this question last year when
he was addressing the striking workers in Okahandja. In ¢es-

sence, Garoeb was asking, “What will happen if Namibia is
exposed to the harsh truth regarding Swapo atrocities in exile?”
BWS' answer to this question is that truth, repentance, confes-
sion and restitution are the only sure foundation for genuine
reconciliation and durable peace.
BWS wishes Garoeb’s soul will rest in eternal peace!

Guilt On His Mind After Death

YES, this is how we have
all learned of the death
Of Moses Garoeb. Now
that he is dead, Moses
Garoeb will be a differ-
ent man. Different from
the Moses Garoeb who
lived during the libera-
tion movement. On the
occasion of his death,
may I convey, through
this newspaper, my con-
dolences to’ those who
loved and appreciated
him as father and hus-
band.

May the “unusual” re-
action to his death make
them an exception. At
this ume of sorrow I do
not want to add insult to
injury of Mr Garoeb’s
family.

Moses Garoceb dies as
a man with guilt on his

mind. He has totally
failed to openly admit
that he was, together with
others, responsible for
murdering many inno-
cent sons and daughters
of the country. Although
he died a troubled death,
he is in his motherland.
He was buried as a
“hero” in disguise.

I am bitter. Moses

Garocb has left his po-
litical successors to in-
herit blood stained

“files”.

In that sense his death
is untimely. They are left
with unanswered ques-
tions about the Lubango
genocide.

I have always urged
Swapo leaders to clear
this dark part of our re-
cent history, but with no
success.

Will we have to wait
until the last butcher dies
and been afforded a he-
ro's funeral before we
find answers to this ques-
tion?

Today many families
are crying for their loved

governments tum into one-party
states. This ts the breeding ground
for cormuption and mismanagement.
The principle of succession 1s not
adthered to and we find government

Laurent Kabila

officials clinging onto their poss.
tons, not allowing for new wWeas
and the resultant progress of the
Nation

Hence, we are faced with the ques.
bon of our nextstep .. how are we to
nd our continent of this bloodshed?
Firstly, the perception of govern-
ance on the part of our current lead-
ers has to be amended. It 1s sad to
note that there are only a few of
our current leaders who show genu-
Ine intentions of making a positive

improvement tw the Irving condi-
bons of their own people. Because
instead of changing the traditional
tunes of politics in Afinca, they are
seemingly happy to continue with
the status quo,

When considering the new age of
leaders one 1. continuously reminded
of Kabila of the Democratic Repub-
Ix of Congo. Shortly after over-
throwing Mobuto Sese Seko. Kabila
was seen as the man of polucal
change and modemisation im the
former Zarre but | had great reserve
about his capabilities.

Kabila has shown that my con-
cems were not without foundabon
since his current refusal to allow the
United Natons invesugation into
the mass killings of Rwandan refu-
gees makes one question his claim
of innocence. When caung such ex-
amples I maantain my stance that the
role of leaders in Afnca needs to be
redefined at all cost.

Furthermore, we are faced with
people such as Arap Moi of Kenya
and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe
who have made it clear thet they will

not easily hand over power to some -
one ebe. This is absard after bow:
these men have nun ther respectrve
countnes for more than s.atecn years.

San: Abacha of Nigena, despite
hav ing overthrown a legaimate gov-
ernment, and taking power through
mulitary coup, 1s apparently try mg to
install ademocraticalty elected gov-
ernment in Srerra Leone. Is that not
what we call double standards of the
highest order? On top of that we
have the OAU and United Nations -
two bodies that continue to play
double standards.

Based on thts analysis Africa can
only be saved by the democratic
elecuon imo power of people with
integrity, vision, Cammutment and
dedication to the cause.

As Africans we musi to look for
what we do not have, Le. peace,
tranquillity and economic empow-
erment, and then continue to stnve
for these admirable qualities in our
society.

I CAN restate that peace is the ultimate gift one can
expect from those to whom were entrusted the powers

to govem, fo oversee the people's wellbeing.

Peace isdefined in the Webstcr dictionary as ... “the
state of freedom from social disturbance, a state of
order or security in a community”. People may be nch
but if there is no peace, this nation Is doomed.

The government and the people of this country must
work hand-in-hand for acommon goal: rebuilding and
development of the land - and put their social, reli-
gious and cultural differences aside. The government
which was elected by the people and which has armies,
bombs and other killing materials should not abuse the
national patriotism to oppress, harrass and persecute

those holding different political opinions.

People must help the government and pay their taxes
and, as the recipient of these taxes, the government
must construct roads and allow loans for agricultural
development

As a woman, I see peace as a birthday cake. It takes
a lot of ingredients: patience and love. Peace is not
created by one person. A refugee woman is the target
of rape, violence, harassment, prejudice and mostly
the offenders go free, unpunished and ready to repeat
their offences. There is no tangible ‘piece’ of peacc.
Peace must be whole and enjoyed by all the people of
the country. Peace is a woman who needs to be taken

care of. Welcome Peace.

Have Rights As Well

AFTER reading the article by Albert Kawana (‘ Nujoma
- Best Insurance Policy’, October 23, pp 6-7), | asked
myself why he mentioned the fact that people such as
he with only one passport would “burn to ashes within
Namibia” in case of war and instability, if he believed
SO strongly that his party was taking the correct course.

And he mentions that there are those with more than
One passport. I assume that he means the white Na-
mibians. Who is he to accuse them of being cowardly
and Predicting they will flec their country and “look at
Namibia through DSTV from abroad”? (By the way,
DSTV is a South African company.)

You did mention this in your column (Political
Perspective), and 1 wantto support what you said: even
the white Namibians who were born and grew up in
Namibia have a right to see Namibia as their home.
They also develop a feeling of belonging to Namibia,
just like everybody else claiming that Namibia is
“theirs”. Isn't it their right to defend “their” country’s
peace and stability as well? Do they have to belong to
Swapo to classify as “freedom fighters”?

In this lightitis your and my rightto Speak out against
the Third Term, because we believe that it may threaten

Namibia's peace and stability in the future. And itis our

right to convince others of our opinion by laying open

the consequences that the amendment of the Consutu-
tion might have one day. [also ask myself if supporters
of the Third Term have ever studied history, because
there we find many examples of what an amendment to
the Constitution can lead to.

To give one person more power has very seldom
resulted in what it was meant to achieve. And the
argument of Mr Kawana, that the historic record of
President Nujoma proves his selfless loyalty to the
country, is based on a very naive belief. The president
is no saint, he is also only a human. Power is a very
dangerous thing when given to one human.

T would like toend with an appeal to you: please carry
on with your effort to bring people to their senses. Tcan
only hope that people like you will always be assured
freedom of expression, and that our parliamentdoes not

wish to change chapter 3 of the Constitution in the near
future.

this country during the
years of the !9608 and
19708, Swapo symbolised
the mage of cquality. jus-
uuce and freedom for all
the people of Namibia.
The prevailing sttuauion
then was one of oppres-
sion, denial of justice and
human rights for the
greater magority of the
black and coloured popu-
lation of our land. ‘There
were laws instituted such
as yob reser ations, Bantu

tain categorics of Jobs, no
matter how qualified you
were. One could not pur-
chase of own property or
land no matter how much
money you had. One
could not attend any
school or academic inst-
tution, This circum-
stances were degrading,
humiliating and restrict-
ing the human spirit of
our people for generation
upon generauon. The pot

was boiling and an explo-

s10n Wak Inevitable. That
is why the message of
Swapo found much sup-
port and sympathy among
a broad strala or our op-
pressed population.
Swapo's vision of a ust
pohiucal, social and eco-
homuc society for all eth-
nic groups in the land was
hailed country wide.

Many of us, parucu-
larly in the Baster and
coloured communities,
were ostracised because
we openly proclaimed our
adherence to the Swapo
Siston for Namibia. In
many instances we were
denied basic privileges
that were normal in our
socieues. But we perse-
vered because we were
convinced that Swapo’s
vision was the nght one
for Namibia.

For it was a vision
where people of all col-
ours, tribes and origins
would take hands aod
build a new Namibta, free
of sunfe. oppression and
dental of basic nghts. It
was a vision where we
thought the play-field

would be levelled in terms

ments in all government
institutions would be done
fairly. It was a vision
where no one tnbe would
again try to dominate over
the others. It was also a
vision where all
Namibians live in peace
and tranquillity, where no
Namibian would again be
a political refugee or flee
their homeland because of
political intimidation and
fear,

It was because of this
common vision that the
support for Swapo was so
broad among the Nami-
bian people. It was be-
cause of this common vi-
ston that the support for
Swapo was unwavering.
For many it was a vision
for which they were pre-
pared to sacrifice their
friends, famity and posses-
sions.

For many others it was
a vision for which they
were prepared to lay
down their lives. For
many today, however, the

shining vision of Swapo
has become a great disap-

Ppotetncnt. Por many thin
vision lies shattered.

Why?

In simple terms. Swapo
has for the past cight years
that it has been in politcal
power in Namibia, done
nothing but emulate all the
evils of the past apartheid
regimes. It has instituted
one of the most corrupt
sysicms of self cnnichment
by political leaders and
their close friends and
relauves. It had created an
clite system whereby a
small clique derives all the
benefits at the detriment of
the deprived. poverty
stncken population. It has
instituted tbalism of the
most naked kind in the
civil service and
parastatals.

The Swapo-govern-
ment has squandered our
resources by the mishan-
dling of the national
budget as was again re-
cently pointed out by the
Auditor General. It is ap-
parent that the Swapo
government is just not in-
terested in maintaining

Independence Soul Searching

ON March 21 1990 a new
nation was born. Citizens
in this new nation stood
tall with pnde at the low-
ering of the flag of the
Republic of South Afnea
and when this new na-
tion’s flag was hoisted
They said to one an-
other the old saytng of the
Negroes in America, “We
have overcome”. They
said to one another, “We
are victorious” and then
they made a pledge:
“Never shall we allow
Apastheid and discrimi-
nation to take place in this
country again’, and eve-
tybody then joined in
unity and said, “Let free-
dom reign, let peace
reign, let unity reign.”
This country ts Namibia.
However, something
then went tembly wrong
and the aspirations of
many and their dreams
have become only illusion
and myth instead of real-
ity
As we go back and look
back at Namibia's nine
years of independence I
cannot do otherwise than
feel a sense of being a
failure as a Namibian.
This is because at our in-
dependence we said to
one another that we have
everything under conuol,
indeed, we were told by
our leaders, “We have
been in the intemational

community long enough
notto repeat the mistakes
made by others.”

Laudubly our leaders

introduced the policy of
national reconciliation.
Yes, we adopted aconst-
tution that has become a
role model not only in
Afnea but indeed in the
world at large, However,
something just went
wrong and nine years
later Namibia has lost its
idenufy as a nation.

I know that speech af-
ter speech will be given
by our leaders during our
independence celebra-
tions over the weekend
and we will be told that
everything is just fine.
This is like’ Chinuva
Achebe, the Nigerian
wnier, woting in the early
days of Nigerian inde-
pendence. He said “we all
have been in the rain to-
gether unul yesterday, we
have not been indoors
enough but when our
Masters left we barri-
caded ourselves and from
within we sought to pur-
sue everyone so that all
arguments must cease and
that all people must speak
with one voice.”

Fellow Namibians, itis
a sad reality that the
Swapo government that

who were in exile have
barricaded themselves
woth all the wealth that
Namibia has and today
while the mayority of
Namubtans are faced with
poverty, many of them
have become million-
aires. Yes, there will be
those of you who, while
reading this letter will say,
can this guy not be happy
for once on Independence
Day?

Brothers and sisters.
my conscience dictates to
me that I cannot be happy
and celebrate our inde-
pendence while:

* The majority of our peo-
ple are suffering under
severe poverty.

* The Government has
failed in addressing the
ever increasing rate of un-
employment.

* The Swapo Party has be-
wayed history by amending
the constitution for a third
term for Nujoma. The
Swapo Party has shown that

they are not fit to govern this

country.

* The Swapo government
despite the search for na-
tional reconciliation is

promoting one tribe
above the others.
How then, brothers and

sisters, can one celebrate
independence if this re-
mains the status quo? .

feady as a nation to take
stock of the mistakes of
the past, so that we can
enter the future with con-
fidence. This is so be-
cause those of us who
spearheaded the hbera-
uon struggle to this logt-
cal conclusion are nol
necessarily the heroes.
but I believe those who
laid the foundation are
real heroes.

Namibians and the cur-
rent Swapo government
have not yet mamied one
another. The truth is this
lies in the fact that what
Namibians want and what
Swapo can offer are two
different things. At the 9th
independence celebra-
tions Namibians must
start with a soul searching
exercise. Indeed we must
ask ourselves whether
Swapo is sull fit to rule
this country and if not
what is the alternative?

It is sad, however, that
many of us remain igno-
rant of what is really hap-
pening in this country. As
long as we benefit from
the system we are per-
suading everybody to say
that everything is okay.

However, the reality is

that everything is not

Where Are

We Headed?

TAKING a close look at whatis happening tn our
region and in Namibia in particular as far as lead-
ership and politics are concermed, Fw ould like to
pont out two things that are increasingly becom-
ing a threat to our democracy

TOLERANCE - Namibians have seen a growing
number of cases where poliucians, especially in the
ruling party, have exhibited intolerance This hap-
pened after the launch of the new party and there
was namecalling, especially about Ben Ulenga.

Launching a political party is in line with the

Namibian Constitution and does not infninge on any

person or other party’s nght of existence.
CENSORSHIP - The fact that State-owned me-

dia are always reporting in favour of Government
and the ruling party ts a clear indication that there
is a great deal of censorship in the media. The state
is footing their bill, but as a taxpayer I want to be
fed with real, correct and factual information and

News.

Hearing lines like ‘the legitimate government of
President Kabila’ on NBC makes me laugh. What
makes Kabila’s government a legitimate one? Is it
because it was brought to power through the barrel
of a gun? [s it because Kabila overthrew a long time
dictator with the help of foreign. troops? Is it be-
cause Kabila happens to be a personal friend of
some of our regional leaders? Would someone

please tell me how Kabila’s government got its le-
gitimacy? °
In conclusion, I hope that our democracy, peace
and stability, that we chensh and-enjoy, does not
go down the drain. Of course we can only accom-
plish this if we are all tolerant-of one another as
countrymen and women irrespective of our politi-
cal differences and affiliation. colour, creed and

religion.

in Caprivi. The people from Caprivi, I take it,
understand the situation better than other Na-
mibians. Onlookers see the situation in many dif-
ferent ways including Chief Riruako, the NHSR
and the Opposition’s views.

Butall these are partially right or wrong and the
truth of the matter is that tf you harbour bad
feelings about others you end up getting hated
yourself!

The tribal animosity that the Linyant: tribal
authority has been nurturing.

The amalgamation of tribes into a single Mafwe
tribe, the conflict that raged on between the
Masubia and the Mafwe which later spilled over to
the Mayeyi and saw a spat of roadblocks, beatings.
shooungs and the killings of two teachers, one at
Sachona and one at Linyanti, the resistance against
the government, threats of death and finally the
flight to Botswana are all signs of the times and a
bad outcome.

The security forces were prompt otherwise we
would have seen worse. The whole source of the
matter is power, both tribal and political, with
empty promises made by Muyongo to his cohorts.

He thought fighting for it would be the easiest
way, but he underestimated the government, and
the poor followers out of despair just followed
blindly. Who is then to blame? Of course not the
security forces nor the government, but Muyongo

Both the dying and living have nghts that need
to be recognised equally. We know lawyers are
making money out of the situation, but this should
not undermine the rights of others Ttis interesting
to hear from a certain lawyer that he condemns the
activines of the rebels but at the same time hes the
one pocketing money from the same people for
their defence - what a double standard Would ut
therefore not be interesting to find out how those °
photos got to the media if there was money
involved and if this 1s so to what degree 1s this
professional? Namibians should put the blame
where it 1s due

This was a very unfortunate self-sought situa-
tion, the security forces therefore performed their
national duties as expected of them One wonders
what national role rebels were fulfilling apart
from committing abominations.

If you put your hand 1n a hole where a snake ts
you should face the consequences of the outcome.
Let the government carry out its constitutional

IN a democracy such aS Ours, peo-
ple are generally allowed to ex-
themselves freely on issues
of the day. Conversely, others are
normally expected to be tolerant of
those views provided such views
are expressed within the limits of
the right of freedom of
expression. That is tte.
However, after having read
Frederick B Philander’s letterin The
Namibian of 23 December 1999
(Ulenga’s Faux Pas), ] had the feel-
ing that Mr. Philander abused this
basic fundamental right. In fact, his
sentiments would have gone unno-
ticed had he not resorted to antics

Philander’s Faux Pas

wards the wishes of the people and
a total disregard for the democratic
process in Namibia.

Philander claims that the major-
ity of the Oshiwambo-speaking
people voted Swapo back into
power. Ido not think it is necessary
to go into the modalities of such a
wayward claim. It would be more
appropriate to say however, that
Swapo scored eleven out of the
thirteen regions of Namibia. That
means from north to south, east to
west. Some of us in the analytic
community read this to mean that
development under a Swapo gov-
ernment has taken place
countrywide and the people thus
voted for a continuance of this de-
velopment. invaluable pesce and

tranquilsty. Ics quite obvious that
cither Philander tums ablindcyeto

rhese realities or he has difficulty in

reconciling with these facts.
Philander further goes on to fc-
veal his ignorance and confusion
with the term one-party state and
the constitutional amendment im
favour of the presidential third term.
Let me enlighten him. A one-party
state is characterised by the consu-
tutional provision that only one
political party 1s recognised by the
state. Namibia being a democratic
country, this is highly inconceiv-
able. Philander expressing Ppesst-
mistic views obviously does not
have faith in the Namibian democ-
racy. As for the amendment to the

constitution, the constauuion has

been legally and democratically
amended to allow for a third term
Nothing more than that.

Like 1 said earher, Philander’ s

views would have gone unnoticed
had he not resorted to insulting the Namibians ine

electorate who voted Swapo into
power. In his failure to understand
why people have spoken the way
they did, he suggests that the masses
“mustreally have their heads ¢xam-

nation” and suggests grass 1eno-

For Our People’s Safety

IN recent months, much has been said
about Namibia's involvementin the war
in Angola. Opposition parties, in par-
ucular, have been questioning the legal-
ity of providing logistical support to the
Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) in its
offensive against Unita.

It is common knowledge that since
gaining independence in 1990,
Namibians living along the Angolan
border have been subjected to Unita’s
banditry activities. Their cattle and per-
sonal belongings have been and con-
tinue to be destroyed by Unita bandits.

Itis because of the suffering inflicted
on Namibian civilians near the Angolan
border that the Namibian Government
decided to provide logistical support to
the FAA, in its offensive against Unita.

Whatare the opposition leaders worried
about? The defeat of their long-stand-
ing ally Unita? Aren't the lives of inno-
cent Namibians worth such Protection?
Opposition leaders in this country
should learn that while they where busy
destroying the Katutura Compound and
eating boerewors behind the central
shops in Katutura, the Angolan govem-
meat was offering its territory to Swapo
to fight for this country’s freedom, which
they (the opposition) are enjoying more
than the people who struggled for it.
Moreover, the Battle of Cuito

Cuanavale, which speeded up Namibia's

Don't we therefore owe it to the
Angolan government and its people, to
Assist them in their quest for peace?

- V's _y = -

There are of course many ways of achiev-
ing peace. Our Prime Minister on Febru-
ary 22 2000 addressed the nation in the
National Assembly and listed all efforts
by the Namibian Government and the
intemational community in achieving
peace in Angola. The role played by
Namibia was no secret. It was public
knowledge just as it currently 1s. Who
didn't know that Unita leader Jonas
Savimbi was invited to Namibia in Au-
gust 1996? All other mectings arranged
with Unita officials were also made pub-
lic.

The excuse that banditry activities are
as a result of the logistic support offered
to the FAA is rather musleading. Unita’s
banditry activities were reinforced by
the fact that Unita is on the run, cut off
from logistical and other supplies which
resulted in sheer desperation and
cnminality.

The Government has a responsibility
{0 protectits citizens, and maintain peace
and stability which is being threatened
as a result of Savimbi's unwillingness to
comply with intemationally brokered
peace agreements for his county.

I, therefore, think that we all owe it to
the Angolan people to assist them in

obtaining genuine Peace and stability in
their country, which otherwise we would
not enjoy as long as Unita continues to
be led by Jonas Savimbi. All We need at
this moment is unity, in order to achieve
Peace in this region. And the oaly solu-
Gon left to achieve peace and stability is
by offering Support where it is most

Let's give Credit where it is due. There
is ing wrong with the Namibian
Government Providing such support. In
fact, such support was long overdue.

some amusement your

Being a journalist my-

to point out to you the
dangers of assuming the

You quoted me as saying
that: “The future of the

once a full investigation
into the circumstances of

completed.” From this
you deduced and even

Ministry of Environment
and Tourism has already
confirmed, upon the out-
come of the investigation,
that the elephant cow that
was responsible for the
attack would not be killed.
It is, therefore, clear
that your assumed option
was incorrect. The other

Being aware of at least

I AM a Kavango student
_ beset in Windhoek and

crisis situation in the
Kavango is going from bad
to worse.

Government's reaction
| towards this problem is a
; complete riddle to me.
| What is the use of just sit-
| ng in luxurious offices,
peacefully and quietly,
while life is really a living
hell in the Kavango. The
Government should rather
find a solution to this mat-
ter, instead of just saying it
is the people of the
Kavango themselves who
are collaborating with
Unita.
. Let’s come to a reason-

criminations against each
other. This situation where
Kavangos cannot even
enjoy the basic pleasure of
peace, progress, prodper-
ity and stability should not
continue like this. I feel we
need the total deportation
of the MPLA from Nami-
bian soil. Zambia has done
it, why not Namibia too?
One thing the Govern-
ment should be aware of is
that Unita’s banditry ac-
tivities are always on CNN
and this will discourage
more tourists from com-
ing to Namibia. So we will
lose anyway, as our coun-
try’s economy depends on
tourism and this is reason
enough for foreign busi-
ness people not to invest
their shares in Namibia,
especially the Kavango.
Some of the schools in

the Kavango, like Max WINDHOEK

Makushe Secondary
School, Linus Shashipapo
and others won't have
physical science or math-

interested in coplyintt ;
these schools due to thea
unstable situation in the
Kavango. In this way the
economy and academic
issues will gradually be
affected.

So the Government
should not yust stand by. it
must do something - de-
mand the total withdrawal
of the MPLA from the

Kavango.

20010907,20010907,peace,Peace.20010907_page_1.txt,1,"Ten Reasons Why Caprivi Should Get A New Name

ALLOW me to clear up
and elaborate on what has
become a controversial
hot potato on the name
change for Caprivi.

Who was Caprivi to
start with? Caprivi was a
German Captain in the
German colonial army.
Shortly before they were
defeated by the British
and the South African
forces, Captain Caprivi
and his forces quickly
decided in that short ses-
sion held at their Head-
quarters Schuckmanns-
burg to name the region
Caprivi in addition of the
existing Itenge name.

This was decided to
have a two-fold connota-
tion. Firstly as a landmark
that clearly states that the
entire Namibia was colo-
nised by Germany. Sec-
ondly, with the name
Caprivi intact it was easy

for Germany to reclaim
the entire country back
after the war and review
all signed agreements with
Britain.

A name change for
Caprivi is long overdue;
it was supposed to change
subsequently after inde-
pendence in 1990.
Change is inevitable and
we cannot run away from
ut.

Why the name change?

1. The name Caprivi has
no cultural link with
Namibians residing inthe
region viz Masubias.
Mafwes, Mayeyis and the
San people.

2. Caprivicuts short the
history of Mafwes,
Masubias, Mayeyis and
the San people whose his-
tory goes as farasthe 15th
century.

3.The scrambling of
African history teaches us

that most Afncans come
from the Great Lakes
where the name Caprivi
Never existed, hence it
only came alive in 1915.
(Note: languages existed
before the name Caprivi.)

4.The name Caprivi dis-
criminates hence all
Namibians residing there
cannot be called
Caprivian, only those born
there.(note: Capnivi is not
a language but a German
name.)

5.The name Caprivi
promotes rebellion and
secessionism since it im-
plies

Namibians who hail
from that region are from
a country other than the
Land of the Brave.

6. Caprivi assumes the
status of a different coun-
try, hence it ts the only
Namubian region that sub-
jugates citizens, viz, we

don't have Omahekeans,

Ohangwenians nor
Khomasians, why
Caprivians?

7.Caprivi should not be
compared to cities and
towns like Windhoek and
Tsumeb which explicitly
teflect their origin by
name. It is subject to
change without vote or
referendum to suit the pre-
vailing changes and de-
velopment, so as to bring
about peace in the coun-
try. Remember it is one of
the most troublesome re-

gions in the country.

8. The name Caprivihas
nothing in common with
Namibian people.

9.The name Caprivi
could have been a con-
tributing factor to the past
and ongoing tribal con-
flict in the region. Nobody
really knows its real mean-
ing. I'm aware the new
Name may not make
Katima Mulilo clean.

10. Caprivi is the only
Namibian region, which
is not indigenous - it has
no historical background

with its people.

The name praises
Caprivi and his father
Zipfel and indeed the en-
tire German people as he-
roes and will continue to
haunt us as long as it ex-
ists.

Having said that, my
choice of name is Zam-
bezi Region. It is neutral,
impartial andis Namibia’s
major tourist attraction.
Nearly everyone drinks
water from (the river). We
all live from it either di-
rectly or indirectly

through its fish In this way
we will remain Namibians
and will never be
‘Zambezians’.

Note: Contrary to your
version of how Caprivi
got its name, the strip of
land was named after

Viva Ndaitwah For Snub At UN Launch

I] WOULD be extremely pleased if you could publish
my reaction. I am basically writing in response to an
article which appeared in the Friday (August 31, 2001)
edition of your newspaper titled “Minister snubs UN

taunch”.

I think the Minister did the nght thing by ignoring the
launch of the so-called human development report. This

Minister should not even agree to talk to them before
they publicly apologise to the nation or publicly ac-
knowledge that this report was a mistake.

If they have no respect for us, there is no reason why
we should show them respect. It must be reciprocal. Is
this how they justify paying themselves hefty salaries

‘Answer For Terrible Tragedy

THE attack ontwo Ameri-
can cies js a terrorist act
of such magnitude that a
few words of condolence
hardly seem appropnate.
Nevertheless, our hearts
go outto the families who
have lost loved ones, and
the American people as a
whole.

This terrible act of ter-
tor highlights a number
of issues, which are dits-
turbing forall ofus living
in the free world. Whilst
we can never justify ter-
ror as a way of solving
problems, the signs point-
ing to this tragedy have
been around for some
time, and this tragedy
could have been avoided.

The premature fingers
of suspicion are pointing
at Osama Bin Laden as
the perpetrating master-
mind, There are many
other proups around the
world who have no love
for the American admin-
istration, and these acts
could have been com-
mitted by any ofa number
of organisauions, and not
allofthem of Arabic ori-
gin.

It must not be forgat-
tenthat Osama Bin Laden

isa creation of American
foreign policy, if there is
such an animal. Bin
Laden was aided and
abetted by America when
he was a member of the
Mujehadin when they
were fighting the Soviet
forces in Afghanistan.
Atthe ume he was act-
ing in the tnterest of
America, and being sup-
plied with weaponry.
Saddam Hussein is an-
other American creation
(read Schwarzkopt's au-
toblography) who was
supplied with weapons
and the very biologtcal
gases that they now want
toconfiscate. These were
used by frag against lran
inthe eight year war be-
tween these (wo coun-
tries. The same guses
were used in Vietnam. It
must be remembered that
both Bin-Laden and
Saddam Hussein are Ar-
abs. and America has
made it patently clear
that it has no interest in
the Arab world. its peo-
ple. or its progress.
America acts only in its
own interest. hence the
military base in Qatar.
It is unashamedly pro-

Israel (read pro-Jew-
ish).

No country, which
postures as a world
power, can broker peace
in the Middle East if it
displays the kind of bias
that America does in the
that region. There was a
time when we merely
suspected that there was
this pro-Israeli bias, now
everyone on the street
knows it, and what does
that do for the integrity of
American diplomacy in
the world?

The Middle East con-
flict could have been re-
solved many years ago if
America had not been a
biased peace broker, but
the Jewish intluence in
Congress and American
society generally, made
that tmpossible. Also.
American foreign policy
is NOL something that 1s
clearly defined. It ts, in
fact, and ad hoc arrange-
ment, which flins with
the devil at the best of
times. The results are
now clear to see. Puni-
tive strikes against the
perpetrators wall also
achieve very litle.

Everything that has

tragically come to pass
over the last few days is
symptomatic of the man-
ner in which the Ameri-
can administration goes
about its business.

It ts sad and tragic that
Innocent Americans
have had to pay sodearly
for an administration,
which has let them and
the world down so badly.
Itis also indicative of the
fact that world powers
no longer stand on prin-
ciple when dealing with
issues. Instead compro-
mise ts the standard and
ethics and morality 1s
being so rapidly eroded
that we no longer stand
up for our rights as equal
occupants of the planet.
America would do well
to look at why it was
targeted in this terrible
act of terrorism. It can
ensure that this never
happens again. and I
hope that tts energies will
be used in the areas
where they matter most.
My condolences to all
atfected by this terrible
tragedy.

PLEASE allow me space

Paper to comment on

wake of fears of a possi-

Following the attacks
on Amenican interests in

ton it is not surprising
that the US propaganda
machinery made this the
worst-ever Story reported
so far in America. The US
media did not give acom-

ple where massacred by
US forces in Vietnam or
in the Gulf War to name
but a few.

It is sad that innocent
people died in this attacks
but I just wonder whether
the lives of Americans are

THE NAMIBIAN

America Must Not Wage War

worth more than the lives
of Afghans, Sudanese, Vi-
etnamese and other states
where people have been
attacked by US forces.
American presidents
should have remembered
that “what goes around
comes around”. Is it not
always innocent people
who die when “big” men
are fighting? Just like
those who are going to die
when Afghanistan is at-
tacked? The world should
wake up to the realities at
hand. The US itself was
labelled a terrorist state in
the past and it is exactly
what they are.
Remember what hap-
pened with Patrice
Lumumba and the war of
the Bay of Pigs in Cuba?

They are using Pakistan
and the sympathy of other
countries to launch a full-
scale attack on a sover-
eign country.

I just wonder where the
sympathy of the world
was when innocent peo-
ple died in missile attacks
by US forces on the order
of former US President
Bill Clinton in Sudan af-
ter the bombing of the US
embassy in Kenya and
elsewhere? It shows the
hypocrisy of these coun-
tnes that are supporting
the United States in this

look at the hypocnsy of
the Pakistan ruler who
came to power by over-
throwing the former gov-
ernment and its leader. He

is buying face with the
USA and its allies at the
expense of his own peo-
ple.

This new war is a rev-
elation that the United
States is an aggressive
state and retaliation will
not stop but intensify ter-
rorist activities against the
US.

How can there be peace
in the world if only a few
countries are living in
complete wealth at the
expense of the rest of the
world? I'm really ques-
tioning this new war idea.
What makes US intelli-
gence sure that these at-
tacks have been master-
minded by Saudi exile,
Osama Bin Laden? There
are many suspects in this

case, just to name a few
countries that showed an
anti US stance such as
Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Cuba,
Palestine and many oth-
ers.

The US has failed for
more than four years to
arrest Bin Laden, a clear
sign of the weakness of
the US security, intelli-
gence and defence organs
against international ter-
rorism. I really think that
they are abusing the sym-
pathy of the world to at-
tack a sovereign state if
Bin Laden is not handed
over.

The attacks on the Pen-
tagon and the twin tow-
ers of the World Trade
Center is a clear indica-
tion that the attacks were

aimed at what is repre-
sented by these buildings
rather than the innocent
victims. Itisa known fact
that the Pentagon repre-
sents the military power
of the US and that the
World Trade Center rep-
resents globalization,
capitalism, colonialism
and other negative vices
which is still repressing

Is a US attack on Af-
ghanistan really justifiable
if one considers the facts
above? [ think they want

1 AM sure that every peace-loving citizen of this planet
was horrified by the senseless loss of life when America
was altacked, but believe me some others were celebrat-
ing this massacre, just (o remind us that we are living in
hell on this planet.

To every Amencan who has lost a father, mother,

being who can console you in times like this and that is
the Lord our God. Take refuge in Him since there is no
cross too heavy for Him to carry.

The big and powerful US has a long history of
imperialism which has created an established array of
enemies, ie. fanatics, extremists, fundamentalists, mili-
tants of all types. The US had been assisting people like
Savimbi, the late Mobutu Seseko and many African
dictators and the former minority apartheid regime of
South Africa. Also through the 1960s the Vietnam war;
the steadfast support of Israel; and economic sanctions
and other steps against Iraq without stopping. All these
resulted in death of innocent civilians.

I do not support killing of innocent people whoever
commits such acts, whether they be fanatics or Ameri-
cans or whoever. However, the American people must
keep aneye on the foreign policy of their country. Ifthey
see that the policy ts wrong they must make it known to
their government that it is wrong. If they keep quiet than
they agree to what America Is doing in foreign countnes
or they will continue to perish in such attacks.

The US will investigate this attack and dispatch
missiles accordingly to those supposed to be responsi-
ble for this attack. That will be revenge and in turn the
extremists will react again.

Revenge is not for human beings to take, revenge ts
reserved for Gad. Since after every act of revenge more
innocent civilians will dic. After all this who will be the
good one and who will be the bad one? Both will be bad
since they kill innocent civilians.

If peace and Jove could be bought with money America
could have been the country of choice to five in. Love ts
to sit down and listen to the poorest person’s problems.
to try to solve them and assist to the best of your ability,
even those who hate you. Let God be with the Amencan
people especially those who lost dear ones, to have the
strength to gothrough this hell. Let the Lord also be with
those responsible for the attack before they fall into the
same hell they created tor others.

THE 11th September 2001 was not just a bad day for
America, but a very sad day for me, personally, and my
entire family. This is the day, we lost our dearest and
beloved father, Tate Joel Shikongo. May his soul rest in
peace and enter heaven. At any rate, this is what this very
terrible and fateful day also means to me.

Now, just what makes anybody decide to commit such
horrific deeds of terrorism against the mighty nation on
earth today or against anyone else for that matter? Was it
a revenge for the evil deeds that America has been doing all
over the world to others or was it just some act of mindless
terrorism by some mad dogs out of nowhere?. Either way,
what was clear ts that the acts of terronsm committed in
America recently are certainly so hard to justify ... let alone
to be condoned by any human being with a mind, soul and
heart!. I surely would like to join the rest of the sympathetic
world and give my sincere condolences to all the American
families and individuals who lost their innocent loved
ones. Any nght thinking human would do exactly that,
except those who feel! that America has been living in the
fool's paradise for far too long. By all means, my hearts
goes out to the victims of those human tragedies in America,
just like it does for the many poor victims of oppression,
diseases, wars, poverty and hunger, ete everywhere in
various parts of the world. [ would therefore like to urge
here for America to look into the mirror, and see the real
image of themselves. Terrorism is the same. whether
committed by an individual or a government. Amongst
others, the real problems which America will now have to
solve is their often racist. arrogant, hypocritical practices
and double standards in the world. This may just turn to be:
the real victors and durable solution to the problem of
terrorism, now and tn the future. As a Muslim, I know that
my God does not condone terrorism. My salaams to all.

ALLOW me to express my views in your esteemed
newspaper. They are in connection with the ongoing
confusion of the Angolan situation with the main news
topic in the intemational political arena, namely the fight
against terronsm.

I take this opportunity also to express my condolences
to the Amencan people for the loss of lives on the [1 of
September events.

It1s clear by now that the terms terronst and terronsm
have to be redefined and a consensus to be reached
amongstall that belong tothe human race. The way ahead
is challenging but also highly rewarding. Basic justice
and a dignified human lite for every inhabitant of the
earth are at stake here. The concems about state terrorism
should be given the necessary attention. For instance,
enforced disappearance and arbitrary Killings of citizens
committed by state authontes should be considered as
acts Of state lerronsm,. A typical example of such as state
in Africats Angola.

ignored contlictin Africa ts being staged in the beautiful
landscapes, hills and savannahs of Angola. Twill refrain
tromdis ing deep into the causes of the crv il war that rages
for decades now, for they have been exhaustively cov.
ered. Tam going to stick to crucial facts to refresh the
memory of those in oblivion. who stl] fantasise in giving
tothe Angolan niling party tree hand to continue deer
mauneg the Angolan population and plundering the natu-
ral resources. For those. a hittle piece of advice: forget it,
Or at least, think reasonably alf over again. Here are the
facts:

- The MPLA did start the civil war Tin 1975:

- The MPLA did cheat the veneral elections in 1993
and tnitiated the civil war Th

- The MPLA violated the peace accord of Lusaka 1994

by resuming military operations aimed at total destruc-
tion of Unita (its old sweet dream , by the way).

The MPLA leadership, who successfully metamor-
phosed from demagogic communism to venal capital-
ism, never had the guts, stomach and neither the slightest
desire in the distant past and now to face real opposition
parties. Why? The answer is quite simple: the Angolan
Cake is so awesome, astonishing and magical that it will
constitute a sacrilege to share it with someone else other
than the top few people of the ruling party. Thus the
current tragedy. In this regard the intemational conimu-
nity, especially the Wester countnes that continue to
milk the proverbial wealth of Angola has done very ttle.
As a result the majority of Angolan population live in
abject and sordid poverty contrasting. very painfully,
with the unashamed opulent life style of few ruling party
individuals and army generals.

Calling Unita and Dr Savimbi terrorists? And what
about the atrocities committed by the Angolan army
forces, security. the police. and many other paramilitary
orgamisations under the patronage and tmpheit support of
the unqualified and non-elected president JES? Is this not
considered state terrorisay?

Can you unagine the number of deaths caused by the
consututional, military, law and security enforcement
agencies lawlessness, of the so-called Angolan goverm-
ment? Do you have any tdea of the death toll caused by
hunger and starvation. lack of health services, uncontrol-
lable banditry and even lack of potable water including in
the capital Luanda itself, derived from the chronic eco-
nomic mismanagement. blatant incompetence, rampant
cormuption. nepotism, of the so-called Angolan govern-

here must be casualties in any war no matter the

ccautions taken to minimise collateral damage,

There is talk of a humanitarian catastrophe of
immense proportions because of the fallout from
hostilities combined with the ravages of a crip-
pling drought in Afghanistan. There are sugges-
tions that food drops will not adequately address
the situation. Women and children ure being
maimed in these punitive strtkes despite denials by
the US. and the western world seems united that
this 3s the way to fight terrorism,

The barbarity of the Middle Ages is with us right
now, except that death and destruction is being
dispensed at the press of a button in the clinical
surrounds of control-raoms thousands of nules
away. If Osama Bin Laden was the real target, then
real soldiers. with real courage should have been
sent to his lair, to seck him out. There would hardly
have been any collateral damage or civilian casu-
alties. But America has no longer got the nerve for
real combat. Instead it conducts war games with
*play-stations’.

Waging war is no way to fight terrorism! Bomb-
ing civilians and then trying to win their support
with food parcels is anything but civilized in
anyone's language! If the total cost of the hard-
ware, the munitions and the personne! committed
to the conflict were quantified, then much more
would have been achieved by spending that kind
of money on programmes to win the minds and
hearts of the Muslim world in a tangible and
meaningful way.

At the moment the Muslim world is being in-
censed to the point that the gains the US are hoping
to make, will be transformed into even more anti-
American sentiments. We have seen how these
simmering feelings of alienation have manifested
themselves on 11 September, 2001.

The world does not need more of the same, and
the present American campaign will merely re-
duce Afghanistan to rubble. The result will then
be that they (USA) will fund reconstruction un-
der a government of their liking, anul new feel-
ings of alienation fead to yet another generation
of hostilities. because the US fistens to no one but
itself.

Like the Roman Empire, the USA will, indeed.
must, implode us a world power. because of its
outward-looking tendencies. Finding faultoutside
its boundaries, tailing to engage i any introspec-
von, and gradually moving towards a society ham-
strung by curbs on the very freedoms that tts
claims to champion, will lead to its own destruc-
tion. The signs ure already there.

The problem is that America does not see itself
to blame for anything in the world to-day. Its
people. despite a reasonably powerful media, are
largely ignorant of what ts done in their name and
in their interests, and the administration, with is
bullying and arrogant attitude, sees itself as the
kings of the world, unchallenged by anyone since
the demise of the Soviet Union, as the balancing
power in the world.

I do not wish any harm to the American people,
despite their misguided attitudes to peaceful co-
existence in a world gradually falling under the
thrall of American power. but no one can avoid
what it brings upon itself, and therein lies the pity.

perception. Why is it that
the Taliban and Muslims in
Saud: Arabia, for instance,
interpret the Q'ran so dif-
ferently? Is it merely fun-
damentalism building uputs
own head of steam on the
one hand, and Arab hedon-
ism built upon oil wealth
on the other, of is there
more oul there that we
should be aware of ?

Why are some nations
invanably so predictable?

That question 1s now
being asked about Amenca.
Though there is a clearly
understood difference be-
tween the Amencan peo-
ple and their Administra-
tion, itis the psyche of the
nabion that gives cause for
concern. In discussion
many Americans will ad-
mit that their government
leaves much to be desired,
yet their use of the ballot-
box does little to change
the status quo. Many
Amencan friends and col-
leagues understand and
share the concerns of those
living outside the borders
of the USA. but are power-
less to do anything con-
strucuve. Big Brother is
invasive and insidious!!!

There ts a brutal streak in
the psyche of the Amen-
can people. The USA might
be the most powerful world
poweronthe planetto-day.
but lis not the most civi-
hsed! It sull practices capi-
tal pumishment and ex-

ecutes human beings in the
most horrendous and bi-
zarre ways devised by so-
called modem man. From
passing thousands of volts
of electneity through the
human body to lethal injec-
tions, and all in the name of
justice, must rank as the
crueflest indictment of civt-
lised norms and standards!
The Amencan people have
come to believe that this ts
how one exacts justice’
They tum itintoa spectacle
by watching 1¢ on closed
circult television in true
Hollywoodian fashion!
Can anything else be more
bizarre, or more brutalis-
ing? Yes, watching Afghan
women and children scat-
ter for their lives while
American bombs rain
down, is more bizarre and
brutal!!
Nottotalk of weapons of
mass destruction! America
1s the only country on the
planet to have dropped an
atomic bomb on another
country. The immediate
destruction was bad
enough, bul what about the
nuclear fallout, not just for
Japan but for the region?
Ord Amenca care? They
regarded thal as a major
achievement in the annals
of technology and modem
warfare! So much for car-
ing about the planet! And
the refusal of the Bush Ad-
ministration to sign the
Kyoto Accord, what does

that say about commitment
to the well-being of the
planet and the rest of us
mortals whoare not Amen-
cans? And the use of agent
orange in Vietnam, was
that humane?

It is my bebef that the
power and might of the
Amencan people ts par-
ually based on their dam-
aged psyche. Insttutional-
ised violence and brutality
desensitises them to the
feelings, aspirations and
sensitivities of the rest of
the world. A judicial sys-
tem based on brutality can-
Not create justice, Just as
war and destruction can
never bring about peace

After the hberation strug -
gle, both South Africa and
Namibiaremovedthe death
sentence from their legal
systems. None of our op-
pressors and persecutors
was condemned to death,
and no Nuremberg-type tn-
als were held to revenge
the deeds of the past, dur-
ing which thousands also
lost their lives over many
decades. Instead, we opted
for reconcihation, and we
are all the better for that
This self-same apartheid re-
gime in South Afnca was
supported by the USA as
was Unita in Angola. Bill
Clinton's administration
went as far as requesting
the De Klerk governinent
(o ensure thal no nuclear
technology fell into the

hands of the Mandela-Ied
ANC government, because
they could not trust the new
black leaders! They were
happy to throw their lotin
wath the white panah racist
regime, bul they would not
trust the new black govern-
ment.

No. we do not need any
form of moralising from
those who backed our erst-
while persecutors. We par-
Ucularly have no interest in
being on ‘their side!” Back-
ing ourselves cenainly does
not imply backing terror.
win and that is what the
Bush administration is so
clumsily trying tointer nits
statement that “we are et
ther with them or against
them!”

Amencans need to di-
vest themselves of the no-
tion of revenge as a means
of creating a peacctul
word. They can do so by
distancing themselves from
their own forms of institu-
tuonalised woltence, which
they mistakenly believe to
be justice. And they can
begin to show some regard
for the mithons of us who
are not Amencans, and who
do not share all of their
values. ethics and morals
notwithstanding

The restofthe world docs
NOT have to catch a cold
when Amenca sneezes!

AMERICA has always
presented herself notonly
as a superpower, what-
ever that means now, but
also a moral power of
some sort. However, any
critical observer of the
American governments
and administrations,
whether past or current,
knows that their moral
and ethical banks have
been chronically bank-
rupt!

These are the very
same people who are de-
ceptively against terror-
ism and the use of weap-
ons of mass destruction?
Really, for how long will
these people continue to
delude themselves into
believing that they can
fool all the people all the

time?

Whatare they doing to
Afghanistan and the in-
nocent Afghans ts surely
a crime against human-
ity!. But, who will pun-
ish this kind of modern
and technologically ad-
vanced type of terrorism,
when the whole world 1s
told to either be against
Bin Laden's alleged ter-
rorisin or tor American
terrorism!

This type of moral
sickness 1s at the very
heart of global instabil-
ity and a serious threat to
world peace. Incidentally
Islam means (universal)
peace.

If Muslims inthe world
get deceived by all the
sweet talk of Bush, Blair

and company that they
are not involved in a cru-
sade against Islam and
Muslims, then they may
wake up too late to real-
ise that the Afghans will
have been nuked to death,
right in broad daylight.
America has publicly
confirmed that they have
used the so-called tacti-
cal nuclear weapons.

In fact, what is meant
by carpet bombing? What
do you bomb for over a
month in a country like
Afghanistan? What else
1s left to bomb except ci-
vilian targets which they
fancifully call collateral
damage. Inthe meantime
terrorists like Ariel
Sharon continue to com-
mitacts of genocide, with

the generous assistance
of America in Palestine.
Isn’t this clearcut moral
bankruptcy and down-
righthypocnsy? America
must just learn to recog-
nise that that it has never
been innocent of global
terrorismitself. Terrorism
is just evil, even when
committed under the
guise of anti-terronsm and
under the American flag.

God Almighty tells us
in the Holy Quran, “Fear
them not, but fear Me”
and Stand out firmly for
Justice and truth, no mat-
ter. Down with global ter-
rorism!

This century has expen-
enced the most homfic and

bours. Evidence of ill-treat-
mentis not difficult to find:
for instance the suppression
of women in Afghanistan.
Womoenare forced under the
veil and are given noor little
freedom.

Most of the world seems
not to be showing any genu-
ine sympathy or taking joint,
firm action against viola-
tors of human nights. It is
mystifying to understand
how or why any human be-
ing can torture or show ag-

gression to especially the
most feeble and defenceless
of all.

Even babies as little as
only nine months are vic-
ums of these evil deeds.

Babies are greeted with
hatred and torture instead of
love and secunty. Citizens
are brutally murdered and
our elders depnved of the
respect and protection they
deserve.

It is confusing how our
leaders enthusiastically

preach about peace and hu-
man rights and at the same
time enjoy power and wealth
while the citizens are suffer-
ing. Some leaders are even
unfaltenngly proud of per-
seculing innocent people for
pretty cnmes .

I believe that itis our duty
to safeguard human dignity,
protect human nghts and
most of all, the importance
of life. It should be our
number one pnonty because
evil has no borders.

a female friend to lunch for a chat over some usually good
and fresh food. The order was compnsed of a salad and
toast for the lady. After having been helped promptly, the
waiting began. As the minutes ticked by one after the other,
I decided to enquire about the delay. One of the waiters told
me that the order was almost ready and that I should be
patient. | was amazed that a lukewarm pasta salad could
take over 25 minutes to make ... after all — to cook pasta
takes at most 10 minutes!

Eventually food was served at 13h40. After ealing as fast

ask for the bill to pay for food consumed. Amazingly, for
the next 10 minutes no waiters were to be seen anywhere in

asked for the bill, clearly stating that I was by this time in
a great hurry. It was 13h58 already, and my friend and |

rather hike to know how a person can go
so far, better: how can a young person
lose his human and social values to
such an extent? What do the neigh-

think that they (and us) can prevent
such gruesome crimes in future?

was in 1992 and 1997 respectively,
when President Moi won in both
instances, enduring a tight reign
on power that he has stretched to
24 years, two better than Mugabe.
Kenya goes to elections again this
year. What happened in these two
elections was worse than Zimba-
bwe. Presidents Mui and Mugabe
are two of akind; they are the most
unpopular leaders who rule agn-
cultural states that were formerly
British colonies. They are birds of
the same feather, with Moi presid-
ing over the most gross human
rights violations ever witnessed in
post-colonial Kenya, arming and
instigating the now infamous tnbal
clashes that pitted one tnbe against
the other (ethnic cleansing), caus-
ing massive family displacement,
loss of life and property.

he? He has been feted before and
feels personally betrayed, almost
cast into political oblivion before
clinging to the last saving grace,
the land issue. Like asnake hunter,
he now strikes the head and
sees the pain resonate beyond
Zimbabwe. He persists and he ts

When Headmen March On 4th Term

THE recent marching of Swapo kings and head-
men is a wrong move. It's a pity that our people,
when they are in numbers supporting the same
idea, think they are right. They think that means
“one Namibia, one nation”. What we must think
of is what the fourth term means for us as Namibian
nation, not to make one man bappy. What is the
extent of its advantages and disadvantages? The
fourth term is costly. It will lead to more hunger
and poverty. Peace can never be maintained by an
individual human being, unless it is deserved by
all.

The demanded referendum is an additional
election. Where will the millions of dollars come
from? Will the nation be sacrificed again for an
individual advantage and benefit? Are we really
serious? To change the constitution to allow a
fourth term means money (millions). This burden
will be put on the already suffering Namibian

and hence we have a very limited time, die to the
lack of funds, for the re-registration of élections.

The money will be misspent as we still have a
high unemployment rate in the country and those
in the recent youth service scheme from
Grootfontein could be employed. Or is it Swapo
party that will fund the referendum?

The extent of love within a human being is the
same as hatred. Chiluba in Zambia is an example
of the peoples’ turning point from love to hatred.
Next, the same people who are chanting. “We did
not sleep, we want Sem_.blah, blah”. They will
call for prosecution after they discovered the dis-
respect of our country’s constitution by him and
the misuse of our country’s limited resources for
individual benefit. Which reasons will they give
and what difference will they make between the
current President and his successor who will be
demanding a third and fourth term? He will also
be liked and supported by a majority like Neison
Mandela and Bill Clinton. It is the same type of
people who will march again then.

A Pain For The Youth

I WILL always be saluting the patron-
age of this widely read and informative
newspaper. The Namibian newspaper
still has the monopoly in terms of good
reporting both during the colonial and
post colonial period - itis still reporting
things as they are.

The aforementioned statement can-
not be defeated by any useful and re-
sponsible Namibian citizen. The gov-
emment does things without looking at
the implications associated with its ac-
tions. One would always wonder if the
top government officials, including the
President, have advisors at all. Being

unemployed, we the youth of this nation
learnt with dismay of the government
ban from advertising in the Namibian. It
is very expensive for us job seekers to
buy both the New Era and The Namibian
at the same time. If the government is
shameful to come back to The Namibian
it must establish a free of charge weekly
paper where we can get the government
job adverts. Otherwise there will be no
need to campaign for the next elections
nor bark about peace and stability.

Right Wing Afrikaners, Take Note!

Noval with shock and dismay in The Namibian of
; about the activities of the so called
Boer nation warriors’. I want to express my views.

I do not know whether the “boerevolk krygers”
elements are also present in Namibia, but if there are
such members or those who are aspiring to such
ideas, keep such ideas dormant infinitely. It is
friendly advice.

I am very concerned about this terrorist move-
ment causing havoc in South Africa with its result-
ant destruction and disregard for human life and
property. This movement, although it has been in
existence for years, has surely come at the wrong
time. Those conservative, radical boers:
that they do not live in Utopia whereby
promote the ideology of Aryan nationalism. They
must learn to live with diversity. We are all people
of different colours and that we have to live side by
side. No one is superior or inferior to the other. To
be bad is not an inherent character, it is a learned

habit due to the environment in which one is raised.
Anyone can be bad.

Criminality is not confined toa specific race. No!
Itis part of human existence and under certain social

potential cnminal.
This reminds me of what Mr Hannes Smith (edi-

tor of Windhoek Observer) once wrote. | quote: “No
man/woman is bom a criminal. Criminals are made
by conditions, environmental factors, to Say noth-
ing of social conditions”. How true are those words
from an open-minded person.

Those who are aiming to wipe out the black nation
(in case of Soweto) must know that the black man
can act io the same way. Does it sound inciteful or
a threat to you? Maybe, but not to me. Together we
can make or break this world.

Nine bombs in all were enough to take away many

lives.
n one’s livelihood is threatened, you invent

ways to counteract in order to protect yourself to
survive. Let us live in peace rather than war. War 1s
bad so let us avoid racial hatred since we did not
choose who we are. Let us find lasung pragmatic
solutions that would see us through to the next
development level. Life was meant to be lived by

all. No one has a patent on life.

THE lingering debate and pos-
turing by political Pundits, tra-
ditional leadership, the ordi-
nary citizens and ‘outsiders’
about the need or not for Presi-
dent Nujomatorun for another
term, the so called ‘Fourth
Term’ as Head of State, can be
likened to a rhinoceros, which
looks different depending on
where the observer is Standing
and what portion of its anatomy
he/she is concentrating on.
Each perspective has some par-
cular insights and each is only
a part of the whole!

As an ordinary Namibian
citizen from the Caprivi Re-
gion, I am therefore delighted
to hear of yet another concerted
and well-orchestrated cam-
Paign to convince and/or urge
our President to seek another
term.

There is an American Say-
ing, “if it ain't broken, don't fix
it’. My positon is simple and
goes something like this: the
inconclusive leadership transi-
tion (no domestic pun intended
since most of the senior leaders
tn the Party and Government
are seasoned, tested and com-
petent) that the fecently held
Swapo Congress Produced,
raises important questions
about who will really be in
command should President
Nujoma step down after the
expiry of his current term.

While I am a great believer
in ‘collective leadership’ (it’s
casy if you are one of the cho-
sen ones), I suppose I've be-
come disillusioned with poli-
tics - and I think most
Namibians have become disil-
lusioned with politicians too.

READERS’ Letrers

Happy About Fourth Term Cam

An intellectual friend of
mine once commented,
“Namuibians don't want to ac.
cept excuses any more - if
there's money tobe stolen, why
isn’t there money for the Ppeo-
ple?” It would appear we still
don't have our Priorities right.

Once upon a time I was al-
ways fixing everyone else's
problems, but not my own and
gucss where it landed me?
What has all this to do with the
Fourth Term, you may ask?

Despite a mosaic of tribula-
tions and misplaced Priorities,
every day I ask the question:
‘Can President Sam Nujoma
do no wrong?” The answer is
an emphatic NO.

Namibians love him above
all other Ministers and even
the feeble and weak Opposi-
ton grudgingly admires his

Political talent. At his age,
President Nujoma has lost none
of his charisma he had inexile
and is a man of all seasons
liked by all Namibians from
any comer of this great nation
of ours.

Perhaps the Breatest asset
credited to President Nujoma
1S good governance.

Since independence on 21
March 1990 delivered high lev-
els of security, Provided qual-
ity education and health serv-
ices, respected political

ms and human rights,
framed a strong rule of law,
bolstered an economic frame-
work conducive to growth and
has provided an environment
in which civil society can flour-
ish.

Hence, there is a direct cor-
relation between good national

BOvernance and economic
Prosperity.

Ordinary Namibians havea
right to expect a better life af-
ter all the sacrifices they en-
dured during the liberation
struggle. People do not fight
for ideas but for Peace, mate-
nal benefits and a better future
for their children.

The majority of Namibians’
expectations of independence,
namely, their sincere hope that
freedom from colonial rule
would usher in a new era of
basic rights and freedoms long
denied by settler rule. This is
what the liberation struggle
meant for ordinary Namibians.
President Sam Nujomaiis there-
fore an embodiment of the
aforementioned ideals.

The big question for Presi-
dent Nujoma, therefore, is not

Tuesoay Marcy 4 2003 9

paign

as much opposition from anm-
chair critics from the West,
amateur politicians or ‘

sition parties "" but the envy of
his own Colleagues, some of
whom have bowed out due to
their political naivete.

President Nujoma has one
rule: he says something each
day and in such a manners that
it becomes the talk of the aa-
ton. He is therefore in the Spot-
light most of the time - all of
which impresses the Namibian
voters and makes his fellow
politicians seethe with jeal-
ousy.

How debilitating then tocrit-
ics with hidden agendas, thas it
is President Nujoma who is
geting the good headlines.

people who believed the
Newspaper editorialists
when they said that the
best way to preserve de
mocracy would be to sup-
port “President” Bush
whether or not he had Ie-
gitimatcly gained control

of the government.

Of course, that doesn't
hold true for everyone in
the country. Some did pro-
test the bloodless coup that
brought the Bush regime
lo power and some have
been demonstrating
against Bush's attacks on
Afghanistan and Iraq.
Unfortunately, these pro-
tests cannot and will not
stop Bush. Remember,

How To Ta

FOR hope to have any meaning,
it must be founded on reality, on
truth. False hopes only blinds
people to reality. Therefore, we
need to ask: do we appreciate just
how big the problems are that
must be solved to bring genuine
Peace and security? Do we real-
ise how urgent the situation has
become? Is there any evidence
that human solutions would be
equal to the immensity of the
task? For thousands of years men
have sought lasting peace and
security on earth, without suc-
cess. Butnow the situation is most
urgent because of the threat of
war between nations, ethnic tribes,
religions and families. In addi-
ton, other threats imperil life on
earth. One is the world wide pol-

lution of land, air and water. An-
other is population explosion with

such as AIDS. Regarding the pro-
found crisis pervading almost all
spheres of human activity: eco-
nomic and social, political and
military, spiritual and moral, vio-
lence is on the increase and the use
of force as an instrument of policy
and diplomacy has become wide-
spread, the balance between peace
and war has become even more
precarious. Where is this leading?
The United Nations warmed: “We
are penlously near to a new inter-
national anarchy “.

Is there any reason to believe
that men can bring an end to war?
Histoncally, there have been only
a few scattered years when this

Sar Mor 28 208 15
Ckle Big Problems

carth was totally free from

war. In the 20th century alone,
about 100 million people have
been killed in war, neither yester-
day's League of Nations nor to-
day’s United Nations has been
able to stop this slaughter. But
won't the fear of nuclear weap-
ons change this? Wasn't suffi-
cient fear of nuclear weapons
aroused back in 1945 when atom
bombs annihilated two Japanese
cites? Since then stockpiles of
vastly more powerful nuclear
weapons have grown a thousand-
fold. And since 1945 many, many
people have been killed in wars
and rebelhons involving more
than 100 countnes.

In recent years more than 45
nations were involved in con-

flicts. no fear of nuclear weap.
ons has and will op the war.
Granted nations do and continoc
to sign disarmament pacts or trea-
es. Over the century literally
more then thousands of these
have been signed. Yet, when-
cver war sentiments become
strong enough. those treaties be-
come worthless scraps of paper
The United Nations has also
failed to stop war, because al-
though nearly all the counmes
today are part of the UN, they
ignore it at will So we hope that
future world leaders will keep
their word more than they have
done in the past.

MANY more young people are becom-
ing violent in their relationships. Some
of them brutally kill their partners. Is
that love? Love is not violent and vio-
lence is wrong. In Namibia there are
many cases of partners killing one an-
other, because one partner tned to ter-
minated the relationship.

I would like to express my condo-
lences to the three young women Minam
Ndakumininwa Haindongo, Susan
Nangula Ikela and Ipula Akwenye who
were brutally murdered by their part-
nets.

Women should be allowed freedom
of movement and speech and to do what
they want, think is the best and what
they need. Today we are enjoying peace
and stability under the spirit of national
reconciliation. Men should stop mur-
dering women and raping children on a
daily basis.

Women are our mothers and sisters.

They need to be given love. care and
protection against all form of viobence
and abuse. Violence against women and
children is widespread in Namibia Some
young men forced their parmers into
sexual slavery. Is that love? But love is
not pain or violence. The death of even
one woman in Namibia in this manner 1s
unacceptable.

Let us respect their quahty and dig-
nity. Let us show our comradeship and
solidanity as young people of Namibia to
oppose this villainous behavior.

\ would also appeal to the law enforce-
ment authonties to take drasnc actoa

Facing Up To Destructive Forces in Namibia

NAMIBIA is one of the few
countries in Africa that contin-
ues to enjoy peace, stability and
unily as a nation after the cruel
joke of colontalism was disman-
tled for more than a decade
Colonialism made us a united
nation, because all of us faced
one external enemy at that dark
time in our history. Unfortu-
nately, as independent people
we no longer umite as one. An
apparent external enemy no
longer threatens us. In the ab-
sence of this enemy it 1s much
easier for some people to mis-
take their fellow ciuzens as pos-
sible foes So these foes should
be confronted through tribal af-
filrauons.

Destrucave forces such as tnb-
alism, favouriosm and nepousm
have now taken root in our na-
tion. Tribalism will bring disre-

pute to the present anity of our

nation. The waity of
tioned by people

themselves increasingly pushed
aside to the edges or periphery
of society. So they have to sur-

vive on the crumbs which fall
from the table.

At the present momentif your
find yourself in this country you
are fortunate tn terms of political
stabrhty. Itis not good for many
counties in Africa. Disorder,
chaos and fratncidal war are con-
unuing to disruptorcut short the
life of many common fellow Af-
ncans in those countries.

Ordinary people or laymen do
not choose such an intolerable
muserable situation. The pohtu-
cal elite did indeed bring Cain's
curse on their counmes. All the

problems are not of their own
making Some problems might
be duc to external dependence
and external influence.
In Namibia we are not com-
pletely free from all types of
lems. We have problems of

nomic and political system and
makes it bleed internally that
can be difficult to see with a
naive eye.

Thirdly. crime and other so-
cialevils are making the lives of
innocent and law-abiding citi-
zens difficult. Despite all these
problems we are still relatuvely
at peace with one another politi-
cally. But this peace can be short-
lived as long as these problems
remain withus. Itcan be likened
to a bird flying in the air, anyone
can killit by shooung or stoning

if one wants to.
But let us not be like a nation
of ignoramuses about our reja-

tive stability, peace and unity.
As Africans on the African con-
tinent we are not completely
shielded neither are we immune

nationally positively as acountry
that promotes peace and unity,
which is sustainable amongst its
citizens. Additionally, Namibia
as a country should stnve to use
its diversity to enrich itself not to
kill itself. So the immortal words
uttered by one of the famous,
revered non-violent civil nghts
leaders. Dr Martin Luther King
yor that says. “Thave adream...”
sull speaks and its valid to our
CUITCNE situation as a nation strug-
gling with trbalism and other
evils. As anauon we should have

orher character, abthty and com-
petence and which will determine
the future of our country’s citl-
zens livelihood. If we take char-

ALL I can say is thank God The
Namibian didn’t accept Baffour
Ankomah's challenge to reprint
his entire lecture in full. I'm allin
favour of fantasy fiction but after
reading Baffour’s lengthy,
obscenely self satisfied and
patronisingly racist letter in The
Namibian (not to mention
watching him in person blathering
away on Talk of the Nation), I'd
have to say that Namibia has
suffered enough.

Begone, Baffour! Go back to
your cruel exile in your
comfortable London flat with its
potholed road (not to mention
fancy restaurants, political
security and snappy boutiques)!

Or better still, if you think that
potholes are a serious indictment

of Western values, cut the poor
British some slack, hop ona plane
and leave them in peace as well.

Take your mercenary little rag
of a magazine with you. Open a
newspaper office in Zimbabwe,
perhaps.

I hear there’s one currently
vacant in Harare and you've got
the Zanu-PF government line
down pat. I assume that Mugabe's
people pay you. Or at the very
least fly you around showering
you with free hotel rooms and
bodyguards. Baffy, my little
exiled buddy, tell me I’m wrong!
Can't. Can you?

One final suggestion.

How about returning to your
native Ghana? You can’t still be
in exile surely? Not after all these

years? Not when you love Africa
so much and know so much about
this great continent. Not after all
the political change that has taken
place in Ghana? And you, Baffy,
still in exile?

Or perhaps you are. Given your
morbidly turgid prose, your
depressing dictatorial arrogance,
your inability to write a simple
letter without giving a moderate
newspaper reader (me) dyspepsia,
and the sheer lunacy of your stance
onissues suchas HIV-AIDS, how
wonderful it is to live under
Mugabe, and the evils of press
freedom, perhaps you are.

Yes, perhaps you are.

‘Big Goats Don’t Sneeze Without Reason’

ALLOW me space in the people's
Paper to air my views on some issues
that are not right in our country. Iam
disheartened by the recentevents where
our commander in chief criucised one
section of our community, namely the
whites. Whatis happening? What went
wrong?

There is asaying, which goes: a big
goat does not sneeze without a rea-
son”. ff there is something going on
about the whites tn this country then
we as citizens also deserve the right to
know To blame people just out of the
blue is not a good thing, especially
when itis done by a person who 1s
supposed to unite the whole nation

What has happened to our policy of

dead? Of course it is the government
that broughtitinto being and ifitis dead

but T did not forget fam also fully
aware of the atroc ites that the Germans
and the South Afnean colonisers have
committed against our people but which
whites did this kindof thing? IsitGwen
Lister? Is tt Hannes Smith” Beheve
me these whites, Gwen and Hannes,
also sutfered but of course not the
same was the blacks did. Just like
today some blacks are driving beaut-
tul 4x4s because it suits their status
while some fellow blacks are going

hungry with no shelter, nothing.

I cannot understand that 13 years
after independence whites are still
causing divisions amongst the people.
Are we so stupid that we (blacks)
cannot think for ourselves? How can
we allow ourselves to be divided by
others? Maybe there is something
wrong with our systems, which in fact
might be causing divisions and not the
whites. How many white farmers are
ministers today? How many whites
are CEOs? Of course many are com-
mercial farmers and is it this which is
causing problems? We have the nght
to know.

Saying whites are causing division
while we have the full commanding
power to me is a joke. Fine, we have
the capacity todeal with them. Why do
we say this instead of just acung butof
course acung with reason? We must
alsoexamine ourselves before we start:
pointing fingers at others. I think peo-
ple that are causing division are the
ones that are stealing the public funds
so that the government will be unable
to provide for its citizens. Those are
the people who need to be deatt with
We must try to empower all of our
ciuzens. Let the whole nation enjoy
the fruits of independence. If we ig-
nore that we are just inviting more and
more trouble and then we will blame it
on the whites. Do not laugh at the
snake because it walks on its belly.

We must also understand that in a
country of beggars, stealing and not
begging is considered a crime. There

misfortune”. There are too many steal-
ing in government and no concrete
steps are taken. Al! one hears is pres-
idenual commissions.

They are becoming too many now
and their findings are just gathering
dust wherever they take place. Don’t
we have the capacity to deal with
cnminals

and thieves in this country? I sug-
gest if we have the capacity to deal
with whites we must also use the same
capacity to deal with thieves especial-
ly the ones that are embezzling the
public funds.

When ts the six milhon Namibian
dollars going to be retumed? And who
iS going to retum it and how? Do
whites cause these things? If yes, then
there is something wrong with us. I
mean the black people. We like “nice”
things but we hate working hard. We
are good af blaming others but we
never tum the finger on ourselves. Of
course whites are hard workers that is
why they have what they have today
Of course some of them have acquired
their niches by exploiting us but now
there are laws in place that are prevent-
ing thts kind of things from happen-
ing. It all depends on how committed
we are to such laws

I know that whoever reads this letter
mught say that I am an enemy of the
state but unfortunately 1 am just being
realistic. lam not aCoD, nora DTA or
a RP. I am just myself with my own
mind and brain. Of course those that
do not have their own brain will want
to shut me off Let's not blame the

whites but rather blame ourselves for
our own misfortune. These days the
comrade is not always right because
some comrades are hungry and they
are doing whatever they can do to be
like other comrades. What are the 17
farms for?

It must be clear to each and every
Namibian, whether you are black or
white, Herero or Ovambo, Damara or
Capnivi, Nama or Tswana, San or Ka-
vango, Himba or others that Namibia
is independent forever. Hans Dreyer,
Koevoet, SWATF, SADF and Bothas
are gone forever. If ever they will
come back we should blame it on
ourselves and not on the whites.

God created us with a brain to dis-
unguish beoween what is meght and
what is wrong. If you let yourself be
misled, blame it on yourself. The pol-
iticians should also stop working on
our emouons and feelings. We know
how hard it was dunng the liberation
struggle. We were there when our
homes were destroyed and bumed
down. We were there when our ma-
hangu fields were destroyed. We were
there when our own children were
killed. We were there at Numwandi.
We know all these things. To tell us
these days that whites are bad while
you are enjoying their company at
your farms and in your nerghbour-
hood 1s just a joke to us.

We know how dusty itisin Katutura
but we are sull there. We know all
those things and we also know that
Namibia is unfortunately a mother for
all of us. All we need to hear now is

economic development, peace and sta-
bility, employment opportuniues and
projects so that we can develop our
community.

We don’t want to hear hate speech-
es. We know how bad and terrible the
war was. We don’t want WAR, we
want PEACE.

Man Be Called To Order?

THIS ts my reply to the Namibia
Today article uted ‘It is high nme
for Phil ya Nangoloh to be called to
order’ published in the Swapo
mouthpiece on November 21 2003.

Asapeace loving Namibian I read
with concem the above mentioned
article which shows the intolerance
of some of the Swapo people towards
human nghts and democracy in this
country. In an attempt to silence
Namibia's only vibrant and fearless
human nghts organisation and its
executive director, Swapo through
its mouth piece Namibia Today urged
subordinates that “It is high time for
Phil ya Nangoloh to be called to
order”,

I ask myself why the NSHR
director should be “called to order’?
The article made some allegations
about what Swapo claims to be
“fabncated stories”.

Please allow me space in your
newspaper to respond to the said
claim directed at Phil ya Nangoloh,
in particular, and the NSHR, in
general. I want to correct these
misleading and misdirected
allegations.

Swapo claims that Ya Nangoloh
“fabricated” stones with the purpose
of “discrediting Namibian security
forces” because the NSHR made
several reports that Namibian and
Angolan security forces have killed
innocent Angotans during the recent
conflictin the Kavango and Caprivi.
Everybody knows by bow thateither
through eyewitness reports or
through the reports by Amnesty
International, Human Rights Watch
and the NSHR that there were several
killings committed by the Namibian
secunty forces both in Namibia and
Angola. Even recently a member of
the Namibian security forces, a
certain SFF commander, tesufied in
the High Court that he and other
Namibian security force members
were given orders and have carned
out such orders to shoot and kill
people during the night in the
Kavango region.

As forthe Swapo question or claim

thatthe government should not worry
about ineffective groups like Tagoma
referring to the recent morder of
Tagoma leader Shevanyenga, I
would like to say this to Swapo: the
late Mr Shevanyenga was a

Namibian citizen like everyone else”

and the government is held
responsible for the security of every
Namibian. Therefore I see no point
for several government and Swapo
leaders to issue death threats to an
ineffective group which finally ted
to Shevanyenga’s death.

Thirdly, Swapo accused Mr Phil
ya Nangoloh to have “fabricated a
story of people who were perceived
to be eliminated, apparently also by
goverment.”

Itis afact that Mr Phil ya Nangoloh
and other NSHR human rights
defenders received death threats on
several occasions. This makes it
difficult for them to carry out their
acuvities which is what Swapo
wants. However the NSHR and Mr
ya Nangoloh must be praised and
not condemned and threatened for
their courage to have shed light on
such incredible and cowardly
attempts to undermine the defence
of human nghts and democracy in
this country. By publicising the
names of persons likely to be
assassinated the NSHR most
probably has saved the lives of more
Namibians who might be facing
assassinations. In so doing, the
NSHR also strongly defended the
principles of democracy and good
govemance and respect for the rule
of law in this country as enshrined tn
our Namibian constitution.

Fourthly, Swapo goes on with its
accusations against Ya Nangoloh by
denying that there was or there is no
“cross border” trade with Angola on
the part of the NDF. However, there
is strong evidence that the NDF made
use of State vehicles and NDF
soldiers to carry out such border
trade in building materials apparently
for the enrichment of certain
individuals. The NDF themselves
have never denied the NSHR report.

Fifthly, Swapo further claims that
if Ya Nangoloh “do(es) not want to
live under Swapo government, he
should just pack and go instead of
indulging himself in dangerous
subversive activities.” This
misleading statement must be
suongly rejected and condemned
with the contempt it deserves. Ya
Nangoloh and the NSHR have both
the right and duty to accurately
informed the Namibian and other
peace loving peoples about human
rights violations by whoever and
whenever such violations occur.

Human nghts and democracy are
foreign to Swapo and Namibia Today
and this is why the NSHR activities
are called “dangerous subversive
activities.”

It is also not understandable how
the NSHR and Ya Nangoloh are
indulging in any “dangerous
subversive activines” by defending
human rights principles and
combating corruption which is so
tampant in this country. To me such
activities are duties of each andevery
tesponsible Namibian citizen.

Furthermore, it is imperative to
note that the dangerous threats
Swapo has made urging Ya
Nangoloh to “just (to) pack and go”
are actear indication that the list that
the NSHR recently produced after
polling the opinion of several citizens
is far away from being misleading.
Other people can now see for
themselves from the Swapo
intimidationas published in Namibia
Today. task myself what will happen
to Mr ya Nangoloh if he does not
“pack and go” as suggested by
Swapo, especially after being
accused of “indulging himself in
dangerous subversive activities.”
Will he not be assassinated like
Shevanyenga?

Swapo must know that they and
their government will be held fully
responsible for anything happening
to Ya Nangoloh and other human
tights defenders in this country

I AM wniting to you after spending almost a month in
your very beautiful country (over Christmas 2003 and
into January 2004).

I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to visit
both the south and north of the country as well as some
of the coast with an excellent guide and a small group
of other foreigners from various countries.

I also spent almost a week in Windhoek at the end
of my stay and visited the Katutura Victory Women's

Katrina Ganises, and her colleagues there and the
choir sang for a friend from New Zealand and myself
— we were both very impressed by their performance.

Incidentally, I also met a reporter from your paper
the second time I was there.

I sing ina church choir here in the north of Italy and
also with a small jazz band which generally makes ten
or twelve public appearances a year.

I sincerely feel that the Victory Choir should have
more opportunity to appear in public, both to let
people see how good they are and also as a way of
getting funds for their very important project.

I would suggest that they could sing at the airport to
welcome international delegates arriving for meet-
ings and congresses and at the larger hotels, like the
Kalahari Sands, the Safari Court and the Country
Club Resort and Casino, where I feel sure that foreign
visitors would enjoy their performance.

I know the choir would have transport problems to
get to the hotels, but I imagine that the hotels them-
selves would be able to arrange that aspect of things.

I would be most grateful if your newspaper could
print all or part of my letter and am also sending
copies of it to the above-named hotels for their
attention.

The Victory Women’s Movement deserves and
needs your help!

I] WOULD like to express my disappointment and
dismay through your newspaper regarding the
ruling for the Caprivi 13 accused by Judge Elton
Hoff.

Judge Hoff’s ruling for the 13 demonstrated to
the nation that the judiciary in Namibia is in the
wrong hands.

If we look at this issue critically, the judgement
was well orchestrated to be interpreted as if the
Government did not follow whatever rules or
procedures should be followed. But, in fact, Judge
Hoff formulated it (thé ruling) in such a way as to
allow the state to re-arrest them, creating room for
‘reactionary institutions’ (sic.) to cry foul about
the judiciary and painting Namibia as a country
which does not respect its own laws. This is not the
case at all.

The charges remain: the accused allegedly
planned and declared war against the Government
of the Republic of Namibia. Where we supposed to
sit back with our tails between our legs, while our
hard-earned peace is being disrupted and our
country being destabilised?

We all know the results of war - the disruption of
the well-earned peace, destruction of property.
loss of life, hunger, poverty and other setbacks.
Those who wanted to secede the Caprivi had
misguided objectives, were driven by selfishness
and hunger for political power and they — if found
guilty - should rot in jail.

The security forces should be commended for
swift action and a job well done. They have sent a

clear message to would-be terrorists that Namibia
isa well-protected democratic country and whoever
tampers with her sovereignty will feel the wrath of
the Namibian law.

Whose interest does the so-called court ruling
serve?

What made the 13 accused leave the country
under the cover of night? Who invited them to the
neighbouring countries were they were hiding? If
they had a genuine cause, why didn’t they hand
themselves over to the authorities of the countries
in which they were hiding?

But were Judge Hoff and his court blind and deaf
the day when he ruled that return of the 13 to
Namibia violated some international laws and
procedures guiding extradition.

Which procedures did the 13 follow when they
allegedly carried out their attack at Kama Multlo?
Why should we follow some procedures by bringing
misguided elements to be tried back home? Who ts
he (Judge Hotf) to determine the fate and the
interest of the Namibian nation?

NAMIBIAN voters have a right to be informed in order
to cast their votes with commitment and maturity as
far as their future is concerned. [t is in that context that
we - again - request “leaders” to stick to the rules of
democracy and free and fair elections.

Mr. Tjiriange, your previous position as Minister of
Justice should have instilled a respect for the Namibian
Constitution in you. That should at least reach as far as
knowing that it is NOT SWAPO that created the
Namibian Defence Force, Police, Civil Service etc. etc.
- that is an obligation every Government of a country
has.

Swapo is just another political party and not the
Government. Sir - we do not live in 1960 anymore - the
year 2004 is here and we have and want to move on.

We all have an understanding that you might still
feel bitter about your past - let us, however, look ahead
and rather work for a future that does not bring back
those years. Namibia has so many problems that need
tangible solutions. Solutions will not be found by clinging
on to the past and asking weird questions like: “What
did Ben Ulenga tell the Boers to be released?”

Absurd statements like “the CoD has been created
by colonialists”’.

By the way, Sir, the CoD is a legitimate political
party and not an organisation. You can condemn the
“colonisers” till eternity - as long as you, the Swapo
party, still depend on them for food assistance for
Namibians your statements boomerang.

Tell the voters why is it necessary to apply for N$37.7
million donor assistance to feed Namibians?

Tell the voters why only foreigners get major building
contracts these days?

Tell the voters why they - after 14 years of
independence - still live in shacks and shambles?

Why is almost every municipality bankrupt in
Namibia? .

Why is each and every parastatal costing the
Namibian taxpayers millions and millions?

Sir - youas former Minister of Justice - should cry out
loud: babies and toddlers are raped on a daily basis.
Criminals rule the country - Namibians get murdered
for a few dollars - corruption never gets punished.

The list, | am afraid, is endless! The Police force is ill
equipped, ill-trained - why would Windhoek otherwise
ask for a Municipal Police Force?

The Namibian Defence Force - who is insane enough
to want to attack Namibia - Namibia does not need that
Force. The moncy could be spent on housing/education/
health services etc. etc. All these and many more
pressing issues and what can be done about it.

That makes up election material for many months -
Sir - not your defamations and agitating hate speeches.

However - if your attacks on the CoD are an indicator
to go by - the CoD is doing a good job and giving you
ample reason to see an opposition in that party.

Mr. Tjiriange, please come up with solutions for
Namibians since we all know that the tax payers ~ and
that includes opposition party members - pay for Swapo
rallies.

Judge Hoff was not one of high

extradition. Even if itwas acase
of “alleged” high treason that
remains an “allegation” to be
tested in a competent court of

something!).

He says: “We all know the

And I say: So! There is still a

guilty - wait ull then!

He asks: “But were Judge

Which procedures did the 13

And I say: It seems we are
dealing with an arrogant misgui-

the State should not follow
proce-dures simply because
alleged terrorists did the same,

He asks: “Who is he (Judge

And I ask: Are you accusing
the Government of bringing
high treason suspects before an
“unknown Judge”, who has no

ALLOW me some space, please,
to remind some of your readers
that before they write about any
conflict around the globe and the
people involved in it, todo some
research first on particular mat-
ters and to have a more realistic
approach.

A letter to The Namibian
- ‘Condemn the Killers’ - is an
example where the writer shows
his total ignorance about the
situation in the Middle East and
it’s people.

The writer claims that Pales-
tinians are foreigners inthe Holy
Land and should be expelled by
the Israelis in order to achieve
everlasting peace. He also writes
that Palestinians are not men-
tioned in The Bible or recorded
by historians. In the letter he
criticised European Union gov-
ernments for condemning the
assassination of Hamas leader
Yassin by Israelis.

This isn’t the place for me
to write about the 10 000-year
long history of these two great
nations which contributed so
much to world cultures in terms
of many discoveries, writings

and science. My sole objective
is to correct misperceptions on
this particular issue.

The fact is that the Arabs
and the Jews believe that they
descend from the same father
- Abraham. No-one is sure who
came first tothe Holy Land. His-
tory only tells us that Palestine
was first peopled by wandering
Stone Age hunters and that per-
manent agricultural settlement
appeared at Jericho about 8000
B.C. According to historical
claims Hebrew (Jews) tribes
arrived from the desert in Pales-
tine between the 14th and 12th
century B.C.and that roughly
the same time the Philistines
invaded from the sea.

The name Palestine is in fact
anadaptation froma Greek word
“the land of Philistines” and the
name is mentioned many timesin
The Bible. First Book Gen 21:34:
“Abraham lived in Philestia for
a long time”.

Just for the record I would
like to mention that in 1918 the
Palestine population consisted
of 500 000 Muslim Arabs, 100
000 Arab Christians and 60 000

Jews.

At the time of the 1948 war,
more than 500 000 Palestinians
fled from their country to seek
refuge with Arab neighbours. In
every Arab country where they
landed, they were treated as
second-class citizens, confined
to ghettos specially created for
them.

Why EU governments con-
demn the killing of Hamas
leader Mr Yassinis because they
believe that the assassination of
political leaders promotes more
violence and does not provide
a solution for either sides. Not
long ago, Swapo was just like
Hamas, on American terrorist
lists, and everybody wouldagree
with me that assassination of its
President, Sam Nujoma, by the
former South African white re-
gime, wouldonly have destroyed
the relationship between blacks
and whites and caused more ha-
tred; but would ultimately never
have prevented Namibia from
becoming independent.

KINDLY allow me space
in your highly esteemed
newspaper to comment on
the opinion piece of Phil ya
Nangoloh which appeared
in the Namibian of April 16,
2004. fam of the opinion that
statements of that nature and
in that fashion should not be
leftunchallenged by patriotic
citizens.

Prophets of Doom have
always been there since time
memorial. but the opinion
Piece in question does not
only predict a bleak future
for the country but also mis-
lead the readers with regard
to the calibre of President
Sam Nujoma and that of the
Swapo Party of Namibia
lest we forget whys Swapo
emerged

Such statements should be
rejected with the contempt
it deserves by all patriotic
citizens and the international
friends of Namibia

The opinion piece created
an impression that our in-
cumbent President is power
hungry, and also misrepre-
sents the facts relating to the
so-called intighting among
the Swapo Party rank and file
with regard to succession and
a lack of democracy in the
structures of the party

Every movement or or-
ganisation has its power

dynamics and Swapo Party
should not be singled out for
criticism. The recent breaka-
way factions of the Official
Opposition are testimony
that power dynamics exist
in all organisations.

I would like to state that,
people of Ya Nangoloh’s
calibre should know better
about the political dynamics
in this country and should
lead the illiterate masses to
the truth and not make use
of public platforms and their
knowledge to mislead the
youth and future generations
of tomorrow, Its unfortunate
to note that right from the be-
ginning when he emerged as
the Director of the National
Society for Human Rights, he
has opposed the Swapo Pany
of Namibia, its government
and specifically its President
and policies.

When one reads between
the lines of what he said
with regard to the Swapo
Party Central Committee
decision to nominate three
candidates for President, not
only of the Swapo Party but
also of the country after Dr.
Sam Nujoma, one gets the
impression that Swapo does
nothave democracy and that
all decisions are dictatorially
taken by President Nujoma.

Thisisaclear misrepresen-

tation of what Swapo is all
about and is intended to sow
seeds of doubt and mistrust
in the people but also for
the much needed investors
intending to invest in the
country. One just wonders
who really pulls the strings
of Mr. Ya Nangoloh?

Democracy was brought
in Namibia by Swapo and
its leader President Sam
Nujoma. It has been proven
beyond reasonable doubt at
the formation of the Swapo
Party and recently by the
Swapo Pany Central Com-
mittee meeting of April 2
2004 that the interest of the
nation is far more important
than that of an individual.

| hereby submit that is
has also been proven by
the founding father of the
nation and tirst President of
the independent Republic of
Namibia in his last State of
the Nation's Address that he
will leave office by March 21
2005. with confidence that
the new head of state will
build on the foundation that
we have built collectively.
Let us give praise lo a great
leader comrade!

Ya Nangoloh also cites the
State House project tojustify
his claims, forgetting that the
project 1s for the nation and
not for an individual, and as

it was earlier said, “the State
House project should repre-
sent the nation’s pnde (Not
the current one thal represent
a fallen racist regime of the
former Apartheid South
African administration) and
should be a national monu-
ment for current and future
generations”.

It is only those who are
patriots, those who compre-
hend, those who are humble
thatcan appreciate the efforts
of the Swapo Party govern-
mentto builda national mon-
ument of that magnitude. |
am confident that if 1 go tothe
graves of Mr. Ya Nangoloh’s
parents. | will be able to find
atombstone. Why should all
citizens and a free nation not
have something to relate to,
to be proud of and toidentifs
themselves with?

I would like to focus on Ya
Nangoloh’s opinion piece in
particular but not limit my-
selfto mention thatin general
people are out there to mis-
lead the nation. In Swapo we
have learnt to tolerate this,
but Iam of the opinion that
they should be opposed and
excluded by all peace loving
and progressive citizens, by
all means possible!

Mr. Ya Nangoloh. the Pres-
ident is not so narcissistic to
fire the cadres that he has

led as you think and suggest
in your opinion piece. The
President will not dissolve
the Parliament to cling to
power, the President is not
Robert Mugabe and for that
matter Namibia is certainly
Rot going to take the Zim-
babwe route to resolve the
land issue.

A government should
make decisions that are in
the interest of the nation and
agovernmentis mandated by
the electorate to make deci-
sions on their behalf. The
decision to expropriate land
isin the national interest and
inline with the constitutional
provisions. As bona fida
members of the Party, we
expect our leaders to take
action and implement the
Swapo Party Manifestoof the
last elections. Please do not
try to score cheap political
points in this regard

I would like to thank the
President of the Republic of
Namibia on behalf of those
who argue like me for the
generous contribution he has
made to the future of the Land
of the Brave. Your dedicated
service during the struggle
and after independence will
never be forgotten. Your wise
philosophical saying that,
“a victim never forgets, but
the doer does”’ is true in the

circumstances.

Those who criticise the
people's movement Swapo,
and its founding leader today
was part and parcel of the
system that caused a lot of
inequities in all social struc-
tures of the black people.

Mr. Ya Nangoloh’s opin-
ion piece and those that are
similar in content are not
welcome in Namibia, par-
ticularly at a time that the
people are nominating their
next leader, Remember, we
shall forgive but(never forget
what happened in Namibia
prior to independence and
especially those who have
sacrificed their lives for this
nation. Today we are a free
people with only one aim, to
restore Our dignity and claim
back what was stolen and
what belongs to us.

I would like to conclude
by quoting his Excellency in
his last State of the Natton’s
address, “A untted people
striving to achieve a com-
mon goal for all members
of the society, will always
remain victorious” Let
these philosophical words
of wisdom be the building
blocks of our future endeav-
ours comrades

about people, land and wealth. (twas
about the inalienable nght of peopte to

This immediately calls on the
individual who has the right to be
ambitious to exercise transparency
and accountabiltty. Hence the adop-
ion of a system called democracy.
The adoption of democracy docs
nol imply the adoption of a westem
systent, but is rather the implementa.
hon of the best workable sy stem that

and exudes a sense of dational pride
anda sense df worthiness and dignity

can be customised to suit that par-
ucular nation’s needs.

The world has become a global
village mainly due to the strides man
has made in information technology
as well as the affordability and speed
with which people are able to travel
from conunent to continent. In my
own travels [ tind that people have
a keen interest in socio-economic
and politica] matters on the African
continent and the world at large

What | have observed is that the
populace of Afnca is no longer pre-
parcd to accept any sense of embar-
rassment because of corrupt political
leaders in their respecuis¢ countries
‘This gocs for the peopte’s intolerance
towards despotic tendencies from

their interest when at came to the

not be forgotten that it has been the

Hasingcome from the masses docs
hot necessarily essume that those
with power will not be corrupted by
hunger for such power Nevertheless,
these appetites are kept in check
by the fact that there are others to
compete with as well as the voice
of the masses to contend with. The
resultis that the best person wall then

The aim and art of both politics
and religions to unify people and to
ensure the sustainability of that unity
through service delivery. In any capi-
talist society, “service delivery” isa
popular buzzword because the society
isenticed, tempted and encouraged to
consume. Financial interactions are

mainly characterised by producers
and consumers and members of the
population interchanging these roles.
The danger here is that the majority of
the population will become consum-
ers instead of contributors.

Many umes thisleads toa situation
where a minority of the populauon
become very wealthy with the ach
gerung richer and the poor getting
poorer. The electronic media play
@ mgorous role in encouraging this
state of affairs even through their
soap operas whose emphasis 1s on
wealth and immoral living

The bottom line 1s that in order for
aAnauon toachvely engage in matters
that affect it’s existence, the elected
potiucal and church leaders together
with the bureaucrats and technocrats
in both the public and pnvate sector
huve to present the nauon with in-
novative cutting edge programs that

tained a powerful sense of political,

and tranquillity of the country. The
Swapa leadership has proven their
tenacity and political matunty over
and over again when tssues, which
could have got oul of hand, were
handled with great craftiness and
smartness as well, That is why ut
should not come asa surpnse to those
who understand the agenda of Swapo
that the president has announced his
decision to bring his tenure as head
of statc to a respectable, dignified
closure as would be expected of any
gicat African leader of our ime. We
can also rest assured that no longer
being the president of the Republic
does not automatically mean that il
is the end of our president's polit

In fact for me it is the continua-

now to take another form. That of

ELECTIONS would be fair if those who vote elected
their representatives freely without any pressure or
any form of intimidation or character assassination?
I strongly feel that (the Swapo Congress) elections
were not free and fair.

The sacking of our visionary, capable Hamutenya
just before elections and smear campaigns against
him by Nujoma on several occasions will never
make this election free and fair.

I would not expect any rational person to believe
what has been said about Hamutenya by those who
did so, including the President.

We expected the President to tell the nation and
the Congress in particular that these are tested
comrades and the everybody should make his/her
own choice accordingly.

He is now claiming that the Congress has voted
in the interest of the whole nation. This is totally
wrong. The congress has voted for Nujoma’s un-
known interests.

If the entire nation was afforded a chance to
elect, I think the results could have been different.
The fact that Pohamba came with a pre-prepared
speech for the victory shows us that the results
were predetermined and the transparency used in
the counting processes is questionable.

We considered Sam Nujomaas the great founding
father of our nation and indeed a visionary leader

of Africa but this was not so. .Nujoma is increas-
ingly becoming a hardcore despot. He thinks he can
turn things around, ceteris paribus. Firing senior
ministers and indecd cabinet members who served
for decades is a big embarrassment to him and to
the public.

Does this mean Swapo party does not have inter-
nal disciplinary procedures to deal with unfounded
defaming allegations? He keeps on referring to
others as imperialists and forgets that he went to
the same imperialists to negotiate for Namibia’s
independence.

His prerogative is being seriously misused. Some
ministers are so much preferred that firing them
would destabilise the country’s peace and stability
and dissolve the gains of our hard-won independ-
ence. This is also a sign that Swapo is slowly but
surely disintegrating.

I think this was the wrong decision at the wrong
time. All the peace loving Namibians (perhaps ex-
cluding despots, opportunists, presidential remote
controls, political armatures, and power-hungry
hereby sympathise with Hamutenyaand his deputy.
We are already missing his intellectual leadership
which we always admired.

quagmire into which the Combi
has dragged Air Namibia, they
would not think that it was the same
plane that brought the ‘feel- good
factor’ in some quarters upon tls
purchase. | trusted that those who
make decisions onour behalf would
be careful not to pour public money

down the drain by engaging in what
seems to bea not-well-thought
through purchase.

The reasons advanced for the
lack of viability of the Bocing
makes one wonder whether proper
procedures that purchases of that
magnitude require, had been fol-
lowed prior to the purchase. In my
book, there seems to be indications
of lack of sound economic think-
ing in the purchase of the Combi.
Consequently, to put my mind at
peace regarding the purchase of
the Bocing, Air Namibia should
answer the following questions:

Was any investigation conducted
to determine the viability of the
Boeing? If it was, why are we now
being told that the Combt's carry-
ing Capacity and its maintenance
make ita financial burden? Did not
the study address these and other
pertinent issues?

Comrades, let us admit that the
purchase of the Bocing 747 was a
squandering of government money,
money which could have been put
to use somewhere else. In my
view, this kind of practice will in
the long run undermine the govern-
ment and therefore to deter this

kind of spending of public funds
in future, somebody must be made
accountable for this shameful
blunder.

If you want me to believe other-
Wisc, convince me that the decision
to purchase the plane in question
was based on scientific invest pa-
tions the results of which were
positive. And therefore the current
financial crisis is nota result of poor
planning. The questionis: Have we
learnt any lessons?

DESPITEall the allegations and lessons learnt from
the past about the incumbent President, none holds
water until proven right, but it is acceptable for
people to speculatively express themselves.

Many people believe that Pohamba will keep the
status quo but experience just outside the border
(Zambia-Mwanawasa) teaches us otherwise. don’t
take charismatic theorists for granted, but I believe in
collective leadership. So long as Pohamba is tisten-
ing to intellectual advice and to the general public,
he will definitely deliver beyond expectation.

The party’s presidential elections are over and
there is nothing one can do to reverse the situation
and those who seemed the most preferred for the
position hold relatively less support within their
political abodes.

So, what else can a rational peace lover do? In
this state of affairs, | think it should be a wait and
see scenario from now on.

20040720,20040720,peace,Peace.20040720_page_1.txt,1,"Down With Hate Speech

PROMPTED by the publication of ...
“instances of hate speech” by the National
Society of Human Rights in our media
allow me to pass some comments, and
express my personal opinion on this very
serious issue.

I don't think it would be necessary to
write or explain more about the grave
consequences of hate speech. It’s all
well known and documented in places
like Bosnia (the country of my birth) and
Rwanda.

I have to mention that for many years |
used to live under two, which I would call
“evil systems”, being communism and
apartheid respectively.

However evil the two were, none of the
two allowed hate speech to be directed
towards other nationalities or races. Under

the communists, hate speech even heavily
punishable by the law.

Here in Namibia where the building of ;
“one Namibia one Nation” and reconcili-
ation should be the priorities for the sake
of peace and stability.

We have destructive elements among
the democratically elected public figures,
like some government officials and union
leaders, who are by their speeches finding
it very difficult to connect their mouths
with their brains.

What makes matters even worse, their
speeches are broadcasted, over and over,
in most of our spoken languages.

Even winning by 99% of votes, no
government can claim for itself to be
transparent and democratic if it allows
the rights of minorities to be disrespected

and violated.

However, NBC and other instigators of
racial hatred in our society didn’t achieve
anything so far and hopefully this will be
so in the future. 1, as a white Namibian,
can still walk freely in any of the “black
residential areas” without fear of racial
motivated attacks.

If Namibian fallen heroes, who died for
a multiracial society and justice in this
country, could now hear what comes out of
the mouths of Kapenda and Kapia, believe
me, they would turn in their graves.

My sincere congratulation goes to all
peace loving Namibians on their shown
maturity and tolerance.

1AM wnhiling in response to the
letter by Mr Alexactus T. Kaure
(How Namibta Supports Israel's
Palestine Occupation).

Mr Kaure has used the words
“blood diamonds” and “Methods
of Suppresston”.

He can make good use of the
term “blood for oil” since most
world leaders ure

so quick appease OIL RICH
Arab nations by condemning
any form of self defence by the
Isracli’s.

The same UN was very quick
to support the war in Afyhanistan
after only one dreadtul day of ter-
ror allacks on American soil.

The fsracli’s have bived with
people who send children with
suicide belts onto Jewish fands
for so many years, thal people
like Mr. Kaure, like many others
may have become used to Jews
being killed.

Very few people notice the fact
that the Israeli’s have tried to
make peace with the “Palestin-
rans” even though the “Palestin-
fan” organisations all have one
thing in common: The objective
of The Destruction of the State
of Isracl.

The Israclis’ have even called
these Arab migrants “Palestin-
ians”, knowing that there is no
such nation as “Palestinians”.
Any person(Chnstian, Muslim or
Jew ') who wishes to contradict
me on this can open his Bible
or Hadith and look for the word
Palestinian.

The closest word to this is the
Philistines, whom the Lord has
driven from His land to give to
the Jews.

I see that Mr. Kaure mentions
that Mr. Leviev is a “sponsor” of
Israel and “Jewish activities”.

So | guess that Mr. Kaure
does not like Jews or their tiny
state. [tis difficult to understand
why people, some who claim to
be Christians, don’t like Jews
since the Messiah has a Jewish
mother, and his first Apostles
were Jews.

The Muslims’ Hadith give
a good idea of what the Arabs
(Umaral Khatibin particular) did
to the Jews and how some of the
Arabs aka ‘Palestinians’ came to
live in Israel.

The last two wecks has shown
just how far the EU and UN will
take their

double standards with the prob-
lem of terrorism.

These leaders are quick to con-
demn Israel for retaliating when
they are attacked by “Palestinian”
militants.

The Israeli’s then choose to
build a wall to keep the suicide
bombers out.

Then the oil rich Arab world
is unhappy because the wall is
very effective in is purpose of
protecting Jews, Christians and
other non Muslim “infidels”.

Therefore they took to the UN
and EU, convinces them that the
“Palestinian” suffering weighs
heavier than Isracli lives.

The biased UN then condemns
Israel for building the secunty bar-
rier. In this case the Israeli’s can-
nol win No matter what they do.
From my Zionist Christian point
of view, the {sracli’s should first
seck their own secunty only then
the approval of Mr. Kaure, the
international courts, the UN’ the
EU and all others who approve
of oil rich Arab nations who are
OK with killing of Jews.

THOPE this time my letter will ap-
pear, unlike the other two or three
cases when you (unintentionally)
omitted them. I will copy it to the
other media, just in case.

I read the rather confusing, if
not uninformed, opinion of Nadia
Ihuhua, where she was dissatis-
fied with Uutoni Nujoma’s pres-
entation to the CHR in Geneva,
regarding the case of the Caprivi
secessionists.

Well, Nadia, like any other
Namibian, you have a right to air
your opinion as you did, so let me
do the same as follows:

How informed are you if you
label Cde. Paulus Kapia as one
of the “government officials”?
When last we checked Cde. Ka-
pia was a Party official. Nadia
rightly alluded to the need for us
to have “responsible and trans-
parent leaders who know what
is important and what constitutes

human-centred

development” She ts right but
which humans are being referred
to? Tome, only leaders tothe con-
trary will allow sucha vision to be
derailed by a few elements

such as Muyongo and his
cohorts.

After all when we talk of hu-
man-centered development don't
we mean the people with a sense
of purpose, that of sustainable de-
velopment, like the ones we have?
Or, Do we mean the detractors, Ms
Ihuhua? Surely we do not mean
to spend all the scant resources
on the rights of the detractors
rather than on the pensions of our
elderly or HIV-AIDs patients?
Do you really think if we spend
millions of $ this case, we will
elevate our human rights record
internationally?

What about the right to live in
peace, the right to food, the right

live without fear etc? What kind
of agenda do you want to set for
us, innocent citizens?

Then again, since you are invil-
ing people to go to the launching
of the NSHR Report, then | guess
I (and everyone else) know where
you are coming from. Good luck
with that event, but for the rest of
us, we prefer democracy, which
is the government by the people
(majority) for the people, and of
the people.

If you really have the future of
our country at heart, please stop
being phony and be a Namibian.
The few people you are talking
about want their own country,

They will have their fairchance
under our laws. The question is,
are they with Republic of Namibia
or with their dream Republic?

20040810,20040810,peace,Peace.20040810_page_1.txt,1,"Namibia Is A Gem

IAM anexpertenced worldwide traveller
and visited Namibia for the fourth time
this July together with my husband and
two children. My conclusion is simple
Namibiaisa gem....comparedeven with
South Africa - let me tell you why:

Upon arrival at the airport we meet
friendly immigration officials who
made us feel really welcome in Namibia
- rather then looking nasty as is the case
in many countries.

The small but cosy airport immedi-
ately gives a feeling of being at home.
Government officials, immigration
staff and customs alike all are very
professional and fnendly. 1 believe
these people should know this and be
encouraged to keep it that way!! To-
gether with our two children we found
travelling extremely easy and secure. All
the way | experienced proper Telecom
infrastructure, roads and nice people.
There are many criticisms of the park
staff of Etosha...sorry | didn’t find those
unfriendly people.

So Namibians be proud you have a
gem in your hands and make sure you
keep it and develop it with a smile.

Another example of where the public
administration does well is the Windhoek
general post office; the staff was most
helpful and friendly to help me with our
son's stamp collection.

Why I did write to your newspaper as
you probably know all this? First there
ismy concern that you are not aware that
vou are doing well.

Critics like to cite recent articles like

those published in Der Spiegel to warn
everyone that the country is in trouble...
Second there ts a warning: | am scared
that Namibia changes its lovely attitude
and becomes involved in issues like
those in Zimbabwe.

This would kill the atmosphere and
tourism with it. You need to ensure con-
unued safety: There is nothing you want
more on holiday than peace of mind.

always felt safe compared to Belgium
(whichis NOT the case in RSA and NOT
at all in Zimbabwe).

That feeling of safety is a result of
how people react in Windhoek up to the
remotest corners of Damaraland.

Something additional to mention ts
medical back up and police safety; you
have a medical evacuation system like
international SOS .

Make sure these people are well
known and can do their work atall times.
For tourists knowing that there is such
support in case the worst happens is a
must...to be a designated destination in
the world.

It doesn't stop with being evacuated
quickly you also need good medical fa-
cilities. | visited Mediclinic in Windhoek
and was impressed by the facilities and
proper care. If | was the government |
would ensure that private initiatives such
as Medictinic and SOS get all support
to be able to flourish andoffer medical
back |up tn case.

20040827,20040827,peace,Peace.20040827_page_1.txt,1,"‘Apartheid’ At Cheetah Festival

PLEASE allow me a
space in your newspaper
to air my concern over
Otjiwarongo Cheetah
Festival which was or-
ganised in June by the
Otjiwarongo Tourism
Forum.

Initially it was a con-
cept to attract potential
investors toOyiwarongo
and expose the opportu-
nities we can offer.

However the end result
of the so called Cheetah
Festival was just another
form of apartheid and
racism which was or-
chestrated toonly benefit
the minority (whites) on
the expense of the black
masses.

My rationale for call-
ing it this is based on
the fact that the black
participating cultural
groups received a dif-
ferent, discriminating,
inhuman and insulting
(treatment. The occasion
was organised so stra-
tegically that the black
groups were performing
at a separate location
at the ‘white elephant’
museum rather than at

the main venue (open
space next to the town
Municipality) where
the white groups were
performing. The main
venue was where most
of the activities and pco-
ple were concentrated.
This was indeed a local
investment centre forthe
festival.

Black groups on other
side were not even al-
tended by the organisers
and worst of all, no-one,
apart from the participat-
ing groups themselves
turned up at the socalled
museum. How did the
black community ben-
efit from the so-called
festival apart from be-
ing used to cyeblind
the local politicians and
waste their time and
energies? The level of
community involvement
from the initial stages

of the whole organisa-
ion is questionable if
the festival was indeed
aimed at benefitting
the entire Oyiwarongo.
After consultations with
the organisers, one of the
black groups was told
to perform at the main
venue, but when they
turned up at the main
venue they were again
told that there was no
place organised for them
to perform.

It must be clear that
We are raising this issue
forthe sake of protecting
national reconciliation
and for the peace and
stability to prevail in
Namibia. To this end,
1 call upon the local
politicians to look into
this matter.

THE other day while looking
through a row of shirts on sale in
a shop in the centre of town,

I heard a young female shop
assistant, obviously fecling very
uncomfortable, saying: “Just leave
me in peace”.

A man, also an employee of the
shop and probably her superior,
was following her around say-
ing:

“But you need to have fouror five
partners and you should be friendly
and nice with all of them.”

Obviously harassed, the young
woman walked off, the man stll
talking tn the same vein, trailing

along behind her.

Wonnen need to realise that this
sort of behaviour is sexual harass-
ment and that they need not put up
with this kind of treatment from
colleagues or superiors.

They should report these men
immediately to their supervisors.

Men should realise that this kind
of behaviour Is extremely uncom-
fortable and repressive for women.
When making any kind of compli-
ment they should pay attention to
the effect their words have on the
woman and stop when they see that
she is feeling uncomfortable.

In this ume of the HIV-pandemic

it is a serious threat to anybody's
health and life to have more than
one partner.

Also sexual harassment of this
kind may make life so uncom-
fortable for the woman involved
that she may quit her job, thus
contributing to unemployment,
poverty and in many cases to the
suffering of children.

Of course, sexual harassment
may also be perpetrated by women
upon men with equally negative
consequences.

AS a peace loving Na-
mibian, I would like to
give my opinion on our
democracy.

] would like to start
with giving my advice and
views to our democrati-
cally elected representa-
tives those are going to
be nominated and those
who are representing us
now, more especially
members of parliament
(National Assembly and
National Council). Some
of our representatives do
not truly represent us,
because we, citizens often

do not nominate them in
the first place. They are
representing their respec-
tive political party leader-
ship. Representatives who
have been so nominated by
their leaders, once elected
to office as parliamen-
tarians and councillors,
become subservient to
these leaders. Instead of
this representative being
accountable to the voters
they are only responsible
and accountable to their
political leaders who nom-
inated them, and who also
have the power to remove

them. Therefore such
representatives strive to
please their leaders often
in patron-client relation-
ships. Such relationships
are often maintained at the
expense of the voters and
the general public. This is
why once in their office,
most parliamentarians
and councillors may not
do what the public expects
them to do.

I know that these rep-
resentatives are not really
representing us because
citizens are not the ones
who nominate them.

What I want toemphasis
is that: I can see that the
top-down appointment
of candidates is not a
good way to go. Voters
have to nominate their
own representatives. Such
representatives nominated
by the voters themselves
know the needs of citi-
zens better than imposed
candidates do. Voters also
nominate a person who
they know and who they
trust. This system of the
top-down fashion of nomi-
nation must be stopped
and bottom- up fashion
must be introduced in the
political parties. I know
if we do this, our country

will be a good example to
other countries. Further-
more our representatives
will be accountable to all
citizens. The representa-
trves nominated by voters
themselves will work in
the interest of their voters
and not in interest of their
political leaders, because
they know that if they
do not work in the inter-
est of their voters in the
next election they will be
kicked out. I wrote this
letter because I know that
we as citizens really need
to be represented.
