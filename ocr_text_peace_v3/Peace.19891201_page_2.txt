- in and out of our country at will. In
_ order for Namibians to live in peace,
there musi be a sense of security.
Moreover, thote gains that we have
- made must be protected. We have to
protect our peace, democracy and
natural resources. Withoul a defence
_ force, our country 1s easy prey. The
concept of demilitarisation can only

be realistic if it encompasses all
neighbouring countries, especially

South Africa. There also must be

democracy and peace in South Af-

rica and Angola for this Utopia to be
realised.

Lastly, a defence force dots nol
necessarily have to be destructive. It
can be constructive especially if itis
defensive in nature rather than offen-
sive. While a deterrent force, ils

nel and infrastructure can be
employed in development projects.

Therefore a defence force should
not be perceived as an anli-develop-
ment force or # threat to Namibians

â€˜but rather as a source of pride and
security to our country and all its
citizens.
