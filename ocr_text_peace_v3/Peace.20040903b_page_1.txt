Stop The Harassment

THE other day while looking
through a row of shirts on sale in
a shop in the centre of town,

I heard a young female shop
assistant, obviously fecling very
uncomfortable, saying: “Just leave
me in peace”.

A man, also an employee of the
shop and probably her superior,
was following her around say-
ing:

“But you need to have fouror five
partners and you should be friendly
and nice with all of them.”

Obviously harassed, the young
woman walked off, the man stll
talking tn the same vein, trailing

along behind her.

Wonnen need to realise that this
sort of behaviour is sexual harass-
ment and that they need not put up
with this kind of treatment from
colleagues or superiors.

They should report these men
immediately to their supervisors.

Men should realise that this kind
of behaviour Is extremely uncom-
fortable and repressive for women.
When making any kind of compli-
ment they should pay attention to
the effect their words have on the
woman and stop when they see that
she is feeling uncomfortable.

In this ume of the HIV-pandemic

it is a serious threat to anybody's
health and life to have more than
one partner.

Also sexual harassment of this
kind may make life so uncom-
fortable for the woman involved
that she may quit her job, thus
contributing to unemployment,
poverty and in many cases to the
suffering of children.

Of course, sexual harassment
may also be perpetrated by women
upon men with equally negative
consequences.
