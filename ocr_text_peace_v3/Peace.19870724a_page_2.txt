Guerrilla War:

ye war, especially in Owambo, con-
‘tributestothe misery ofthe locals. As
a result of the political uncertainty and
lack of international recognition, in-
‘vestments are not readily made in
‘Namibia, with resultant meagre job
creation. The spill-over of the war in
Angola, streches our limited resources
with refugees.

E) Good Medica! Services:
As a result of good medical services
more people survive in an otherwise
often hostile environment. There is a
sense of fatalism and the beliefthat the
State will provide for all needs. This is
often demanded as a right which the
State has to satisfy. Unfortunately this
demand is not matched by responsibili-
ty or contribution. In order to try and
solve the problem, and to avoid an
ecological and biological disaster, the
problem must be tackled with political
will.

A) Population Planning:

Namibia isny arichcountry. Many of
its resourcis are transient e.g.
-diamonds(CDM), base minerals(TCL),
uranium (Rossing), gas (KUDU), and
gold(Karibib), When the mines close,
this source of income is gone. The
resources remaining will be farming,
fishing, tourism and human. If the
human resource is planned and nur-
tured it will be the most important. |
One just has to look at Japan, a coun-
try with virtually no natural
resources, but an incredible human
resource.

Due to the population explosion,
China has taken drastic steps aiming
at one child per family. Parents who
want more will have to pay and forfeit
free services and free schooling. This
may sound very radical but one hasto
be cruel to be kind. The alternative is
another Ethiopia. Here the initia!

Population planning can also not be
seen in the white/black political con-
text. Already blacks outnumber
whites by more than twelve to one.
