will to fight our brothers, while whites,
even in the army, were fence sittels.

We were ‘brainwashed’ to fight
Swapo, but thanks to Swapo and its
reconciliation programme, our cyes
are open at last.

We plead to the people to forgive
us. We have fought against only one
party, the mighty and feared Swapo,
SO we are going to vote for Swapo.

We have decided to join hands
with our fellow peaceloving com-
rades, striving for genuine peace,
freedom and prosperity.

We shall mobilise our fellow broth-
ers to join Swapo for final and Tand-
_slide viotory.

We also forgive the whites for
what they did to us.

To the future President of Namibia,
Comrade Sam Nujoma, long live.
We shall serve in your future army -
the peoples army!
