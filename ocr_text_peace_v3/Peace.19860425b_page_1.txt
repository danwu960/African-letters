Colonel Eimbeck reacts to opinions of Pastor Kameeta

YOU HAVE GIVEN Vice Bishop
Kameeta epace in your newspaper to
volce his opinion. I request thesame
opportunity since you call yourself
achampion for freedom of speech.
Mr Kameeta claims that the in-
dependence of Namibia is an in-
allenableright, and that it sdermand-
od without conditions altached, He
{a right, but why does he, and his par-
ty, Swapo, refuse to acknowledge any
other political opinion in this de-
mand for independence?

Why doesn't Mr Kameeta use his
high office to ensure justice, panos
and freedom for every Namibian?
He is aware of the fact that Swapo
does not tolerate opposition. He
knows that everybody opposing
Swapo will be subject to arbitrary
punishment or even execution
without a fair trial. Mr Kameete
should cupport the call made by The
Namibian on Swapoto ensure a fair

hearing for those who are accused of
being spies for South Africa.

Mr Kamecta should be aware of
the fact that many political parties in
Nadnibia have urged Swapo to bean
equal partner in their opposition to

. perrsabelieae He should also know

refuses to drop the adjec- |
: A wwmatence 7) ne Oe a: | ae

tive ‘sole and authentic represen. |

tative of the people of Namibia’. Ms
Lister should inform Mr Kameeta of
what her experiences are concerning
this imposed status on Swapo. Mr
Kameeta, who has vowed to preach
love, peace and righteousness,
should be in the front to ensure that
every Namibia be granted the right
and the opportunity to work towards
independence of this country.

Mr Kameeta knows that Swapo
regards violence as the only viable
means of attaining independence for
Namibia, but does he consider the
fact that the majority people in this
country are peaceloving Christians
and ‘thus prefer a negotiated
settlement?

Mr Kauriceta calls for boycotts and

disinvestment and calls the potential
suffering of the majority of people
‘empty phrases’. Simultaneously this
Vice Bishop demands that ‘al! peo-
ple must have the right to decent
housing, and bring up their families
incomfort and security. Free medical
care and hospitalisation must be pro-
vided for all, with special care for
tentor citizens, mothers and small
chikdren. The aged and disabled must
be fully cared for by the State’.

Has it occurred to Mr Kameeta
that foreign investment is vital to
achieve these aims? Mr Kameeta is
fully aware of the fact that Swapo
and the CCN regularly call on inter-
national financial support to
alleviate the plight of the people.
Why then should only his party and
its followers benefit from Mnancial
aid and not the majority of the
people?

Will Mr Kameeta care to tell the
public how much he earns and how
much he pays in taxes? Will Mr
Kamecta be prepared to inform the
people of this country about the
lifestyle of those who profess to fight
for independence and tiberation
about their contribution towards the
alleviation of the suffering peoplein
the form of financial contributions?
Can Mr Kameeta inform the publicof
what he proposes should be donc to
obtain sufficient funds toatlain what
all the people in Namibia desire?

Mr contention is that Swapo is
guilty of the most atrocious
discrimination against peaple. Mr
Kameeta is actively engaged in
Swapo's political activities, this
makes him guilty of discriminating
against his own people too. Accor-

ding to the Oxford dictionary,
discrimination means to ‘make a
distinction, to give unfair treatment,
especially because of prejudice’.
Swapo and Mr Kameeta call
everybody who does not comply with
their conditions and with their opi-
nions, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pets etc. Everybody who dares to
speak against Swapo is threatened
and intimidated. Every person who
does not support Swapo is being
discriminated against. This is
definitely not what the majority of
Namibdians will support; this is what
the majority ofthe Namibians want
eradicated,

Mr Kameeta claims his fame and
right to speak about political matters
on his arrest and detention. For any
law-abiding citizen, especially for
devoted Christians, defiance of the
law is detestable. if Mr Kameetaasa
Vice Bishop and even more as a
Swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
alienable right to self-detesmination,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not support an
Organisation which sees only
violence as a means of achleving

what they desire, namety, to takeover
power of this country.
Mr Nujoma has declared more
than once that Swapo {fs not in-
terested in powersharing, bux only tn
power itself. During his recent pro-
paganda tour for Swapo in West Ger-
many, Mr Kameeta has proven thal
heis against any form of opposition
to Swapo and that he disputes the
right of freedom of speech of a Ger-
man citizen in hisown country. With
this act added to his political atsties
against the people of this country, Mr
Kameeta has disqualified himself of
claiming to be a champion for
freedom, Justice and peace.
