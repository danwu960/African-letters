"of what I had to say, particu-

larly about the present state of

_ democracy in Namibia and a
possible onslaught on it, fromy
either the far nght or from
Swapo's traditional support-
ers.

My point about democracy,
which was addressed to a sec-
tion of the audience, had to do
with a linkage that certain major
Westem countries are now
insisting on, such as multi-party
democracy, human nghts and
market economy as anew type
of conditionality for giving
development aid, Elsewhere and
in our country, I have been
Saying that all these require-
ments are fully in place and
functioning in Namibia, yet the
consistency and levels of aid
to our country leave much to
be desired. So much on this
point. | |
