have their own homes which they can
afford and in which they can stay with
their families without any in-
terference. You will not regret a visit
to Hakahana and you will experience
something beautiful inthe joy of those
workers who are united with their
families. |

I am proud to have made a concrete
contribution, no matter how small it
was, to the destruction of the Katutura
compound and to allow my coun-
trymen to otcupy an own home
together with their families. I know
that these menand their families will
eventually have the peace they desired
andthatthey will graspthe opportunt-
ty to contribute to mutual respect and
understanding in our country.

I have never before experienced so
much affirmation for my beliefs as on
Friday afternoon when thousands of
my fellow countrymen witnessed the
destruction of the compound with joy
_and satisfaction. The small
demonstration by insecure people who
were deserted by the organisers,
helped toemphasise the majority ofthe
people who want positive changes
which contribute to a stable future for
our country and its people.

Please publish this letter. |

lam writing to youas an honest and

sincere citizen of this country.
