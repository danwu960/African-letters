d, | who fought in defence of
injustice and colonialism are
today the people enjoying
the fruits of braveness.
iot | Apart from those who have
sacrificed their lives for
national independence,
democracy and justice to
prevail, we have the limp-
w, *| ing injured ones who today,
Iks | because of the war for na-
ate | tional independence and
6. | democracy, have lost some

a | parts of their bodies.
of The obvious questions
on | which suggest themselves

on | include whose responsibil-
e- | ity it 1s to succour these
h- | brave sons and daughters
ne | and whether there is any
at | mechanism in place to en-
n- | able them to enjoy the fruits
of their bravery.
2S There are many answers
it | to these two questions: some
d | of today’s politicians are of
a | the opinion that it is Swapo's
is | duty to look after the brave

le | ‘sons and daughters and give

i- | them essential facilities.

a On the other side of the

al | coin, some intellectuals are
of the opinion that they

1- | should be looked after by

e | their families.

ir All in all, both answers

n | are baseless and do not suit

it | or fit into present political
r | reality.
The government has laid

r
1. | downa foundation of peace
- | and stability based on the
2 | concept of the policy of
f | national reconciliation. In
my view, we were or are
given these golden oppor-
tunities to reconcile our
differences politically, eco-
nomically and socially.

Since our constitution
guarantees job opportuni-
ties for those who served in
the then colonial admini-
stration, it would augur well
for progress if our
constitution writers would
have dealt with the future
plight of the Plan freedom
fighters in depth.

A distinctive law or act
should have been put in place
to differentiate between the
nationalist fighters, the he-

-roes who bravely fought, not

because of monetary gain
or any other promises, but
because of their political
| commitment and loyalty to
” he cause of bringing down
Bite evils of colonialism.
