Why Waste Time Voting For Swapo”

THE judgement on Ong-
wediva is uncalled for.
Our judges are still out
of order and democracy is
surely sinking. Itnolonger
makes sense for anyone to
stand in very long queues
to elect Swapo because
it is just a waste of time.
The person (s) you voted

will not be the person to
represent you. Weare very
shocked by this judge-
ment and particularly by
the intervention from top
authority. Let’s please all
maintain peace and stabil-
ity in our country by not
provoking the forces that
will destroy it. Those that

don’t know much about
politics should acknowl-
edge experience from
Africaand elsewhere that
such political conditions
cause civil conflicts and
dictatorial regimes.
