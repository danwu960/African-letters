ing lies to the mass of our
people.

Your observation that our
decision to disaffiliate from

Swapo was shortsighted,
immature and irresponsible, is
a dogmatic approach that is
accompanied by a security
phobia and a serious lack of
analysis on the role of mass
organisations in #@ post-colo-
nial ora. You seem not to be a
democrat at all.

Nanso is opting for a disci-
plined working alliance with
parties who share common
programmes, objectives and
campaigns. Nanso cannot be
gpolitical in a political envi-
roament

Hence the need for etriking a
balance between the need for
strengthereng the organisation's
independent base on the one
hand, and the role Nanso will
have to play in our country’s
frestructunng of the economy
and the formulation of policies
on the other hand. Our impact
on the situation will depend on
our representation, unity and
strength on the ground.

Our most immediate task is
to mobilise and unite our stu-
dents. Majonty of our students
are unorganised. White schools
remain a challenge and some
students are in undemocratic
student bodies.

We want a Nanso that is
independent, democratic, ac-
countable and under control of

‘its members, not a Nanso that

is aconveyor belt for positions
or decisions of other organisa-
tions. Lastly we want to de-
velop our leadership and
sirengthen our organisational
baso.

T WILL appreciate it if you
will allow me to share my
coacem in your newspaper
regarding housing and employ-
mem with my fellow Namibi-
ens who might have had the
, @ame experiences.
Everybody knows that
Nesubis is fro and yes, free-

dom is hero to stay, but some-
times it feels and looks as if we
are not free at all. There are
some sores circulation in our
town (Rundu) that houses for-
merly inhabited by whites only
will be handed over to the
Ministry of Works while those
houses in black arcas will re-
som under the control of the
Ministry of Local Government
and Housing. This meana that
black people wil! not be given
houses in the former white arca
and vice versa. Black families
currently living in this area are
subject to removal at any time
to look for their own housing
should the authority wish to do
so. If this is true, I think that
people are still boing treated
like trash in this region.

Benefits which were aimed
to help whites and other for-
cigners to ive a comfortable
life, such as the north package
for living in a war-torn area,
are stil! being received by whites
anly. This package covers utili-
ties like free water, free elec-
tncity, free gas, rent-free houses
and even pay just for being a
white person. Everyone in this
area knows about this, includ-
ing top govemment officials,
but they are not doing any-
thing about it.

Friends and relatives of the
housing commuttee, of which
the chaisperson is always white,
are enjoying prompt attention.
No white has ever becagivena
house in the not-so- well-built

j black reeidennal area and I have

never seen whiles suffer as
blacks do when i! comes to
housing.

Any white whocomesto the
region is given a house, while
blacks have to meet certain
requirements. Some single
whates live in big, rent-free
govemment houses while black
families are living in shanties
and caravans.

1 know that housing is a
national problem, but it is bad
tolet families live in the kitch-
ens of their relatives.

As far as employinent is
concemed, this goes hand-in-
land with uke availability of
houses, In Rundu houses are
reserved in case a person of
high rank is hired, while the
others do not have housing at
all. Whenover someone from

Windhock or elsewhere is
employed bere, capecially Lo
service of the government, a
house is sutomatically given
to that person, which is pot tho
case when someone from this
area is employed in Windhoek.

T know that this is done to
encourage people to accept
employmens in the sub-urban
and rural areas, but it looks
like people fram Windhoek are
deemed to be more important
than us. High-ranking jobe are
preferably given to those
coming from the capital, who
might not necessarily have
applied for them, instead of
people m the sub-urban and
rural areas who did apply. This
is an insult to our intelligence,
leadership qualities and our
ability to lead even on a re-
gional level. I am not saying
that we do not need people
from Windhoek, but we ahould
be considered on equal terms.
] know that Windhock is the
centre of everything, but let us
not undermmne, neglect or ig-
nore the potential and ability
of people living in the sub-
urban and rural arcas as was
done in the past.

My appeal to the govern-
ment is:

- to look seriously into the
matter of these unfair prac-
fces and cantinuous detumars-
sing treatment

- the government cannot, as
we know, build houses for
everyone, therefore it should
give low interest loans to the
people who build their own
houses. ] think this will alle vi-
ate the current housing prob-
lem while other altematives
are being explored.

- the Mimstry concemed with
hounng should spend time,
besides feeding street kids,
raising funds for building low
income houses all over Na-
mubia. These houses would
provide shelter and safe home
envirooment to street Inds once
adopted by the low income
families.

- the northem package should
stop with immediate effect
because there is no longer war
in this area and we should all
geta share. We fought to bring
justice and eradicate unfair
practicos in this country. A
quote from the late Martin
Luther King, saysitall: ‘Peace
does not mean the absence of
war, but the presence of jus-
tice’.
