J went for further studies in
India for one year. From there
I was sent to the Federal Re-
public of Germany for acourse

ing. It was difficult however,
to get work expenence in for-
eign countnes. In Zambia it
was not possible duc to finan.
cial problems, in India it was
due to the short time of the

was due to the fact that many

I would like to appeal to the
Minister to take this matter up.
Perhaps he could exert pree-
ore on the NBC to consider
already-trained retumees for
jobs at the Corporation, rather
than appoint new people.

Last year there were several
