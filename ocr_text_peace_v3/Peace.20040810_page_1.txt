Namibia Is A Gem

IAM anexpertenced worldwide traveller
and visited Namibia for the fourth time
this July together with my husband and
two children. My conclusion is simple
Namibiaisa gem....comparedeven with
South Africa - let me tell you why:

Upon arrival at the airport we meet
friendly immigration officials who
made us feel really welcome in Namibia
- rather then looking nasty as is the case
in many countries.

The small but cosy airport immedi-
ately gives a feeling of being at home.
Government officials, immigration
staff and customs alike all are very
professional and fnendly. 1 believe
these people should know this and be
encouraged to keep it that way!! To-
gether with our two children we found
travelling extremely easy and secure. All
the way | experienced proper Telecom
infrastructure, roads and nice people.
There are many criticisms of the park
staff of Etosha...sorry | didnâ€™t find those
unfriendly people.

So Namibians be proud you have a
gem in your hands and make sure you
keep it and develop it with a smile.

Another example of where the public
administration does well is the Windhoek
general post office; the staff was most
helpful and friendly to help me with our
son's stamp collection.

Why I did write to your newspaper as
you probably know all this? First there
ismy concern that you are not aware that
vou are doing well.

Critics like to cite recent articles like

those published in Der Spiegel to warn
everyone that the country is in trouble...
Second there ts a warning: | am scared
that Namibia changes its lovely attitude
and becomes involved in issues like
those in Zimbabwe.

This would kill the atmosphere and
tourism with it. You need to ensure con-
unued safety: There is nothing you want
more on holiday than peace of mind.

always felt safe compared to Belgium
(whichis NOT the case in RSA and NOT
at all in Zimbabwe).

That feeling of safety is a result of
how people react in Windhoek up to the
remotest corners of Damaraland.

Something additional to mention ts
medical back up and police safety; you
have a medical evacuation system like
international SOS .

Make sure these people are well
known and can do their work atall times.
For tourists knowing that there is such
support in case the worst happens is a
must...to be a designated destination in
the world.

It doesn't stop with being evacuated
quickly you also need good medical fa-
cilities. | visited Mediclinic in Windhoek
and was impressed by the facilities and
proper care. If | was the government |
would ensure that private initiatives such
as Medictinic and SOS get all support
to be able to flourish andoffer medical
back |up tn case.
