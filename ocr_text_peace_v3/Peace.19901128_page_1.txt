‘aick gpd tired of bloodshed and we
‘thank the Lord for the peace he has
‘brought to our country so far.

Moet ofus who fought against onc
‘another are now united as brothers
and sisters in one single and mighty
Defence Force. We thank the Presi-
dent of the Republic of Namibia,
Comrade Sam Shafishuna Nujonu,
fos his policy of reconciliation and
nation-building.

We as ex fighters are also commit-
tod to reconciliation and nation build-
ing. We respect this Government as
well as the constitution and laws of
the land.

‘We also want to contribute to-
wards nation-building, although cer-
tain problems have cropped up.

Some of our families and even ex-
fighters in the rural areas of the north
are threatened by certain undisci-
plined Swapo elements. Let me state
clearly that they are not Plan fight-
ers. There isa very good understand-
ing among us as former fighters.

We as ex-fighters can defend our-
selves if necessary bul we want peace.

This is the reason why many of our |

fellow fightors left for South Afnca

and harmony, and they believe they

can get it there. We could also join |

then: but we want to remain in Nanobu.
This is our country and we are proud
sons and daughters of Namibia. _

With the war in the past which was
mostly ran by the whites, there is
nobody pointing a finger at them.
While they live in peace in our be-
loved Namibia, we are being dis-
criminated against.

We do not want reconciliation to
collapse and we are fully aware of the
faults of the past, but we are appeal-
ing to responsible Namibians to take
this matter seriously.

We former soldiors also want to be
treated as human beings. Namibia is
etill e young country, 90 let us all join
hands nd build a new Namibia to
‘show the world what true democracy
aséns - end our children will be
proud of what has been achieved.

We are all hoping to celebration
