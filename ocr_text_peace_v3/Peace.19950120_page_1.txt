Museum’s Not ‘Tacky’
Says Local Historian

HAVE you been to the Alte Feste
lately? If you have, then there is no
need to convince you that the claim of
Carol Kotze made in The Windhoek
Advertiscrof January 13 about “empty
rooms’ isa product of ill imagination.
Ifthe colleague knew what a muscum
is all about, her capectations could
have been different.

According to the International
Council of Muscunis: “A museumis a
non-profit making, permanent inst-
tuvion in the service of society and its
development, and open to the public,
whichacquires, conserves, rescarches,
communicates and cahibits, for pur-
pose of study, education and enjoy -
ment, material evidence of people
and their environment’.

Therefore, a museum ts a cultural
institution of national significance
whose goals reach far beyond mere
the entertaining of tourists. And atter
all. Ms Carol Kotze has no mandate to
speak for the tourist, or does she feel
like a tourist in her own country?

The muscuni's visitors book of im-
pressions of what she Called ‘tacky’
cahibition (Our Namibian Heroes) at

Alte Feste, includes the opinion of
foreign tourists and Nanibians alike.
It speaks for itself, Just to mention a
few of the remarks most often used
over the last tour months: Eaxcellen’
Very Eaccllent/Superb/Fabulous.
These are comments of 38 visitors of
which 24 are Namibian, 6 from RSA,
3 from USA, 2 trom Norway, | from
Denmark and 2 from Germany.

Nice/Very Nice/Beauliful came
from 16 visitors: OK fron 10 visitors:
Interesting/Very Interesting came
from 31 visitors; Thank-you from 7
visitors: Informative/Very Informa-
tive/Educational came from 15 visi-
tors. [tis impossible to mention all the
different cncouraging words in the
book. but the positive remarks are
certainly a genuine indication of the
role of the muscum in nation-build-
ing and atruc reward for any muscum
professionals.

I would advise Ms Kotze, whose
blood pressure apparently rises atthe
sight of muscum eshibitions, to seek
imnmicdiate medical help before she
has aheart attack, for independence is
here to stay and so is the historical
efleciivn. of Che daberatian. struggle

which brought about this independ-
ence.

And if someone's head ‘drops in
shame’ in the light of the historical
facts revealed in the Alte Feste dis-
plays *sinee independence’, then obvi-
ously he/she is against the struggle.

The Alte Feste was visited recently

ctly went through the displays. I took

him around and showed him his own. ,

history has many facts and many tronic
Iwists too, An ancient Roman apho-
rism says: “When the facts speak, even
the gods keep quiet’.

As to Ms Kotze’s concem about
altracting tourists and ‘evestors to
Namibia. distortion and silence over
historical facts will not do the job. This
kind of approach transpired in “her

*the public at large.

Tourists are not a bunch of fools, to
whonrone can sell cheap colonial myths
like the one about Curt von Francois
being the founder of Windhoek or that
ofthe German Schutztruppe whocame
from Europe to “bring peace anvong
the rivalling Nama and Herero’ as all
the present monuments. in, Namibia

It ts evident, trom the litue unpro-
vised museum survey, that the tourists
are interested to know the truth about
Namibian history. Thus, they will be
able to appreciate the real dimensions
of national reconciliation today and
the moral and political generosity of
the Namibian people - a colourful co-
hesion of national characters who
emerged victorious as a nation froma
difficult past. As far as foreign inves-
tors are concerned, they are not invest-
ing in the history, but in the peaceful
and stable present of Namibia and in
the hope for a brighter future, and the
price for today’s peace and stability
was heavily paid in the past.

Thatis why there isa saying thata
Nation Without a past has no future
either.
