Ahtisaari has falled

Forces making for dividing the
UN Special Representative, Mr Marthi
Ahtissari, Magaret Thatcher, South
Africa, DTA, Koevoet and Action
Contra Res 435 have become forces
who want to divide the Namibians
for freedom, Jove, peace and unity.

Ahtisaari has failed in his mission,
like Dr Ercher, the Vice Sectetary
General of Kurt Waldheim in 1973.
Because the ends he served will take
him no further than himself.

It is SWAPO's deep conviction
that all the people wish to be free and
that their desire for freedom is rooted

in the soul of every one of us. A
people long subjectedto foreighh ”
domination, however, does not al-
ways find it casy to translate that
wish into action. Under arbitrary rule,
people are apt to become lethargic,
theis senses are dulled. Fear becomes
the dominant force in their lives; fear
of breaking the colonial and apart-
heid laws.

SWAPO, who led the struggle for
freedom, broke through this apathy
and fear. We gave active expression
to the universal longing to be free.

Our leaders strenghten the peoples’
faith in themselves, and cncourgac
them to take part in the freedom
struggle.

I am convinced the unity of the
Namibians outweigh those who di-
vide us.

Forward with the struggle.
