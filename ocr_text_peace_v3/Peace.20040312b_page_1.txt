Thanks To NBC

I WOULD like to publicly
thank NBC Radio in your
popular newspaper and
fearless news disseminator.
On Sunday morning, (7
March 2004) I was
surprised and excited to
hear an American Voice of
Islam, coming out of NBC
radio. That was between
8h30 to 9h30. The program
was basically focussed on
the “Importance of
Conscience” in bringing
about God-consciousness,
when adhered to properly
by any critical and right-
thinking human being.
The presenter, whospoke
with an Amenican accent,
was talking about the
similarities between certain
Biblical and Quranic
statements on the issue of
conscience and God-
consciousness. As a
Namibian Muslim, I was
naturally happy to hear our
national radio broadcasting

an Islamic message,
moderately, wisely and
scientifically presented. All
I want to say is: Thank you
very much NBC Radio!

On behalf of the Muslim
community in Namibia, |
would like tosay, you made
us feel athome and at peace
by broadcasting the etema!
Message of all God's
Prophets over our national!
airwaves. For me it was the
first time I listened to such
a program. It was, indeed,
enlightening, though, I was
already familiar with the
contents. Continue
educating and informing
the nation, without fear or
favour. Proud of you, NBC
Radio and I am happy to be
Namibian and Muslim!

Thank you once again!
Peace
