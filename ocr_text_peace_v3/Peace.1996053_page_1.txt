Naturally we all know that a
Chief must be from the Royal fam-

Just stand up and say “From now
onwards I will be a Chief of my
own village”. That is impossible.
Even the Minister will never be-
come a Chief if she is not from the
Royal family.

We have todifferentiate between

Politics and tradition, because when
we want a President, we have to
vote, but achiefwe choose, instead
of voting. Even though the Minis-
fer was out of the country, I think
She knows €verything about
chieftainships.

Shufu is not from the Royal fam-

also because of the Government.

She acted only on hearsay and rec-

about bloodahed in the region.

Let the Government not blame
the people but blame itself for what
will happen. 1 would like some
clarification from the Minister her-
self about from which Royal fam-
ily Shufu comes, because Chicf
Mamili is from the Mamili Royal

family.
