On ‘Bethacracy’
IN RESPONSE to Mr Veripi Mungun-
da'sidie talks in The Namibian of Ju-
ly 10 on the topic ‘Coward Lister’, !
would like to point out the following:
1. Lister - nationality and

3] feel it le Ms Lister ofl

tto herself in-
jibes and beatalities conducted
against the Namibian national, ir-
ve of where she was born. She

isa more credible Namibian than you,
who are selling out your nation, your
country and its natural resources. She
pays taxes asall Namibiansdo andin
addition, contributes actively to bring:
ing about of peace and stability to
Namibia, while you keep yourself
tribalistic and passive. Beloved Lister,
keep on, every good work deserves a

2.0P0O-SWAPO -an Ovambo par
ty: OPO has not existed for a long time.
It has been the South West Africa Peo-
ple’a Organisation, Swapoof Namibia,
for along time. How dare you call itan
Ovambo party, although it isa Nami-
bian national political movement?
3. CCN - priesta, puppets Shame on
you, Mungunda. These people repre.
sent the Namibian nation (the Coun.
cil of Churches in Namibia). They are
renowned for fighting for peace, justice
and liberty, and committing
themaelves to the spiritual care of all
Christians
4. Swapo generals - where are they?
Swapo has been willing to sign an ar-
mistice with the Pretoria regime and
latter has failed to agree to it. And now,
Mr Mungunda? Swapo did not glorify
war, but was forced to take up arms
against thoee you praise.
5. NCU - a truly Christian body
Could a truly Christian body request
‘the dismantling of its own nation’s
refugee camps? Campe where Chris.
tian Namibians reside? Who do they
think will house Namibians fleeing
from the racial laws in thiscountry? Do
they think itiseasy tostay outside the
country without proper supervision
and do they think it is easy to provide
such supervision there?
I finally wish to condemn Veripi and
his puppet structure for:
© claiming that apartheid Jaws are
dead in Namibia;
OO requesting pre-independence
t aid and recognition ofthe
interim government internationally;
al supporting the unelected,
unrepresentative socalled interim

t;
é affiliating toan ethnic-based party
mich as Nudo;
C legitimising SA's presence in
Namibia by being part of reactionary
forces such as Etango, Swapol, Swat!
T also condemn the interim govern-
ment for their ‘secret services’ and pro-
paganda of indoctrination and
discrediting Swapo with our tax
monies. They urge Pretoria’s forces to
‘exterminate Swapu' and ‘hit them
harder’ which automatically causes
le to leave the country.
have never been deceived by
Vorster’s regime nor will we be deceiv-
“. by Bothacracy. Remember that,
pi. |
