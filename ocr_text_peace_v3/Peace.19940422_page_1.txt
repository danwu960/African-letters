Falcon’s not a taxi

ALLOW me to answer DTA Presi-
dent Mishake Muyongo oa his two
questions as to whether Swapo has
fulfilled the promises it made in 1989
an how many people have used the
Falcon jet?

Of course Swapo fulfilled its prom-
ises. We are now living in better hous-
ing, have better communication fa-
cilities, better education, better
healthcare and Swapo has also re-
duced the unemployment rate. We are
now living in peace, no more
‘makakunyas’ destroying our maize
fields and beating up people and
Swapo has buried apartheid forever.

With regard the jet, how many peo-

ple does Mr Muyongo feel should
have used it? Does he went everyone
to use it? The Falcon is not a taxi but

transport for the President and his Min- _

isters. :

I strongly believe people will not
vote DTA. and that they will lose the
forthcoming elections with no single
seat in Parliament.

President Nujoma should not con-
cern himself about the DTA in the
coming elections. Swapo will make
sure he rules this country for the rest of
his life.
