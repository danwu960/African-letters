Transforming

be careful that we do not create
a situation where privilege by
virtue of colour is replaced by
privilege by virtue of wealth
and whereby only the ‘haves’

enjoy the luxuries or creature
comforts while the ‘have-nots’
are forced to accept poverty as
their final destiny.

We who are govemed com-
rades must bear in mind that
our new Namibian nation re-
quires of everyone of us to be
a new person, with a new mind,
a new heart and a new spirit. I
also believe that the hope for
Namubia does not just lie in a
political system or with a spe-
cific government. it lies with
us, the people, black and white,
who have come through the
crisis and have had to change.
We need new minds, new hearts
and new spints, hewn, as they
have been, from pain and
humiliation, from repentance
and forgiveness. Therefore we
must not expect our govern-
meat to perform miracles while
we ourselves have not begun
the process of attitudinal change.
