Anti-Conference

TAM against the conference planned for May
this year by the Secretary General of the
Council of Churches (CCN) the Reverend
Ngeno Nakhamela about the detainees dur-
ing the war.

I am also against the feedback given by the
so-called Executive Director of the Society for
Human Rights Mr Ya Nangolo.

These ideas must be Stopped before they
re-open the wounds which have just been
treated by national reconciliation.

If things go like this, let us put reconcilia-
tion aside and start to fight, because Mr Ya
Nangolo always fights people.

A psychological war is more painful than
a war with guns.

Why can’t we stay in peace rather than
fight each other.

Forgive and peace shall set us free.

* Note: It’s not Rev Nakaharnela’s personal
conference, but a gathering arranged by
sember churches of the Council of Churches
