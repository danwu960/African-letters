battle between capitalism and commmu-

teated and vet there an uneasy feel
ing that capitalism should not have
awon the day, because now we are left

at the mercies of robber capitalism, a

market-place dnven beast that has no

eyes and ears for the suffering of the
little people of the world.

Organised labour, in our own coun-

try, has been co-opted politically by
the ruling elite who have simply
swopped their cloaks of soctally-con-
scious respectability for tailor made
Mao suits, hiding their ever-tncreas-
ing wealth and just-arrived-on- the -
market cellphones from the poor be-
hind the tinted windows of their ar-
mour-plated Mercedes Benzes and
BMWs.

Right now, we have a government
in place which, after cight years of
ail the political support they could
wish for, have showed no other in-
clination than (o abuse the powers
granted to them to ensure that they
will remain in power. Yes, the great

And so thes have all become. their
feartul leader included, the unwiting
prostitutes of the “forces of intema-
tional imperialist capitalism”, to use
one ot their favourite phrases, What
sickening irony!

And yet, we are capected to believe
them when we are told that the war
in the Congo 1s tn the defence of in-
ternational solidarity: that we are
fighting a noble war against the dark
forces of American designs to have

us recolonised.
The truth is that the ruling clite
have dreams of becoming richer than

Croesus in “point ventures” with an
equally morally corrupt Zimbabwean
ruling elite in grabbing the precious
natural resources of the Congo for
themselves only (but in the name of
international solidarity).

Their Plan - seize control of the re-
sources, and then sell it to the high-
est bidder, which in any instance
would be those very forces they pro-
fess to oppose... Time will prove me
right here, I just know it

defeated politically and retire to
Etunda Farm? Or will you and your
minions seck to hang on to powcr.
change the Consttuuion to suit your
fear of political obsoletencss and in-

are very hard questions - but we. the
young generation of Namubia, de-
serve a future - and we want to know
if there is going to one.

Wake up, fellow Namibians - we
are living in very. very dangerous
umes. Speak up, of forever hold your
