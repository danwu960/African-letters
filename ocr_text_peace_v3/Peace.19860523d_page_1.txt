- Matjila and 435 |

MR ANDREW MATIILA show-_

‘in favouring the Odendaal system |

ed himself to be a puppet when he
addressed the socalled NDBP ral-
ly in Sauyemwa, Rundu. In his
one-hour speech, he accused the
white National Party of being racist

and AG 8. He atso said Resolution
435 was a United Nations product

which was not acceptable to the | |

Namibians. | He agitated his au-
dience to reject Resolution 435.
He said that member countries

of the UN had no right to say how

this country would become in-
dependent. The Namibians
themselves would decide. At the
same time he said he agreed with
the South African State President
who said Resolution 435 would be
implemented on August | provid-
ed the Cubans were withdrawn

from Angola.

How can he say that the Cubans
have to withdraw from Angolan
soil? He is confused. How can he
say in one breath that the Cubans

must leave Angola, and then in

another, say no other country can
tell you how to rule?

What did the Cubans do against
our people here in Namibia? Is it
not your puppet government which
js delaying our independence? Are

not the South Africans ©
manipulating you with big salaries?

‘What is the NDEP? It is a newly- |

established political party founded

by the DTA in Kavango, and it |

campaigns for the interim govern-
ment in Windhoek and for the
DTA in Kavango. The attendance
at the meeting was poor. In Mbun-
za the attendance was somewhat

better because the chief of the tribe i

threatened a fine of cattle to those |

who failed to attend, 7

: call upon the . peor of
| r

Kavango to ignore and eject Mr
Matjila’s speech and pray for the
implementation of Resolution 435

‘as the only peaceful way (0 gain |
