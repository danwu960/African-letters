Dear Mr Cleary _

YOU too have done some ‘remarkable’
pieces of writing, most recently in
Leadership (Volume $ 1986 Number 2),
in which you measure the success of the
interim government by means of the
vague generalisation of ‘inclusivity’.
This ‘government’, you say, seeks to in-
volve all parties and also to draw to
these same parties, the support
previously enjoyed by those outside it.

May we remind you (hat there are six
parties (some in name only) which en-
joy membership of the interim govern-
ment. Membership of ‘other parties’,
however minor their support, who have
shown interest in the interim govern-
ment, has been turned down, and I refer
in particular to the recent HNP request
for membership of the ‘Constituuional
Council’.

‘Inclusivity’, therefore, hardly seems
to be the goal of this interim
government.

You have not explained why the DTA
prefers to operate outside your ¢on-
sultancy service, and it has been wide-
ly reported (not only in The Namibian)
that there has been a breakdown in
communication between yourself and
Mr Dirk Mudge, an interim government
minitter you claim Lo represent,
What is perhaps of note, is your
f reference to the 'Transitional Govern.
; : he nt’, rather than the ‘Government of

feilpea Unity’. Rainy vyou can no.

ranks, any more than you can claim that
