On Heroes Day

A FEW days from now, *
Namibians from all w
of life will commemorate
Heroes Day on August 26.
Significantly this 1s 4
remarkable day, because of
the nature of the liberation
activities which occurred on
that day between the indige-
nous brave sons and dau gh-
ters of this country and the
then colonial forces al
Ongulumbashe in the north-
ern part of the country.
Those liberation activities
germinated or brought about
national independence and
democracy. It has been a
_ bitter struggle as it was
| depicted by the Honourable .
Minister and veteran politi-
cian Andimba Toivo ya
Toivo during his political
trial.

It was a life or death situ-
ation but despite that, the
Namibian people under their
then vanguard liberation
movement Swapo fought
heroically and pledged or
vowed not to stop their
struggle until all colonial
evils were buried and genu-
ine national independence
based on the concept of
democracy was achieved.

“On 21 March 1990, the
+ pledge of the Namibian
mi people became areality and

4 the nation was crowned with
: the shining star which even-
etually placed our country
fad nation on the world map.
