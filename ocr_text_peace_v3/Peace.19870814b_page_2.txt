[- onething that really surprised me
isthat there are more than a thousand

old houses. Some of them are in the pre-
cess of falling down. The local
authorities have plastered and painted
only 70 ofthem, and have provided the
materials for 40 hirers to do the job
themselves. The rest of the people have
been told thereis not enough money for
the project and that the rent would
then increase by R5 or more. Present
rentals are R25 for a four-roomed
house: R20 for three rooms; and two Â©
rooms, R15 a month. Many of the
renters are jobless men and women
and pensioners.

The local authorities mention in
their most recent report this year that
everything is going well in Otavi.
What they should know is that
everything is going well with the
whites there.
