The important thing to
remember is that many,
perhaps most. of the peo-
ple really do beheve the
propaganda: really do fear

that we are going to “lib-
erate” the people of Iraq:
and really do beheve that
those who oppose the war
are idiots, cowards. or
sycophants of tyranny.

They truly do not see that

Bush is the more danger-

realise that ther own civil

circumscribed by this ty-
rant. and truly donotcom-
prehend that their own
country has been the ag-
Gressor again and again
and is about to become
the aggressor yet again.
Our esteemed “free
press” is of litte use, be-
ing almost wholly contro!-
led by the corporate inter-
ests Bush serves. The
Newspapers and news pro-
grams play along with the
Bush regime, allowing
reports of alleged terorist
threats lo supersede news

Amencans lack the ana-

propaganda to which they
are subjected Many can't
distinguish between ad-
vertisements and news or
between fact and opinion.
Remember, these are the
people who believed the
Newspaper editorialists
when they said that the
best way to preserve de
mocracy would be to sup-
port “President” Bush
whether or not he had Ie-
gitimatcly gained control

of the government.

Of course, that doesn't
hold true for everyone in
the country. Some did pro-
test the bloodless coup that
brought the Bush regime
lo power and some have
been demonstrating
against Bush's attacks on
Afghanistan and Iraq.
Unfortunately, these pro-
tests cannot and will not
stop Bush. Remember,

If all was night with the
