ALLOW me to com-
ment briefly on the re-
port ued ‘Kenyan re-
porter arrested’ which
appeared in The
Namibian issue of April
13.

Incidents of tribal
clashes in Kenya were
first reported in 1991.
Since then, the Govern-
meat has mobilised ail
its resources to address
the problem. Asaresult,
peace has been restored
in nearty all areas which
were affected.

The clashes which
threatened to erase the
traditional Kenyan love
for one another had as al
March 31 1994 killed
383 people and not |
500 as reported in your
paper. An estimated 250

000 people had been dis-
hbmes. Despite the sen-

ia this respect, there are
sections of the print
media who have often

forgotten that the con-
