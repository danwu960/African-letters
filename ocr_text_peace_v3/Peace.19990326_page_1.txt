Independence Soul Searching

ON March 21 1990 a new
nation was born. Citizens
in this new nation stood
tall with pnde at the low-
ering of the flag of the
Republic of South Afnea
and when this new na-
tion’s flag was hoisted
They said to one an-
other the old saytng of the
Negroes in America, “We
have overcome”. They
said to one another, “We
are victorious” and then
they made a pledge:
“Never shall we allow
Apastheid and discrimi-
nation to take place in this
country again’, and eve-
tybody then joined in
unity and said, “Let free-
dom reign, let peace
reign, let unity reign.”
This country ts Namibia.
However, something
then went tembly wrong
and the aspirations of
many and their dreams
have become only illusion
and myth instead of real-
ity
As we go back and look
back at Namibia's nine
years of independence I
cannot do otherwise than
feel a sense of being a
failure as a Namibian.
This is because at our in-
dependence we said to
one another that we have
everything under conuol,
indeed, we were told by
our leaders, “We have
been in the intemational

community long enough
notto repeat the mistakes
made by others.”

Laudubly our leaders

introduced the policy of
national reconciliation.
Yes, we adopted aconst-
tution that has become a
role model not only in
Afnea but indeed in the
world at large, However,
something just went
wrong and nine years
later Namibia has lost its
idenufy as a nation.

I know that speech af-
ter speech will be given
by our leaders during our
independence celebra-
tions over the weekend
and we will be told that
everything is just fine.
This is like’ Chinuva
Achebe, the Nigerian
wnier, woting in the early
days of Nigerian inde-
pendence. He said “we all
have been in the rain to-
gether unul yesterday, we
have not been indoors
enough but when our
Masters left we barri-
caded ourselves and from
within we sought to pur-
sue everyone so that all
arguments must cease and
that all people must speak
with one voice.”

Fellow Namibians, itis
a sad reality that the
Swapo government that

who were in exile have
barricaded themselves
woth all the wealth that
Namibia has and today
while the mayority of
Namubtans are faced with
poverty, many of them
have become million-
aires. Yes, there will be
those of you who, while
reading this letter will say,
can this guy not be happy
for once on Independence
Day?

Brothers and sisters.
my conscience dictates to
me that I cannot be happy
and celebrate our inde-
pendence while:

* The majority of our peo-
ple are suffering under
severe poverty.

* The Government has
failed in addressing the
ever increasing rate of un-
employment.

* The Swapo Party has be-
wayed history by amending
the constitution for a third
term for Nujoma. The
Swapo Party has shown that

they are not fit to govern this

country.

* The Swapo government
despite the search for na-
tional reconciliation is

promoting one tribe
above the others.
How then, brothers and

sisters, can one celebrate
independence if this re-
mains the status quo? .

feady as a nation to take
stock of the mistakes of
the past, so that we can
enter the future with con-
fidence. This is so be-
cause those of us who
spearheaded the hbera-
uon struggle to this logt-
cal conclusion are nol
necessarily the heroes.
but I believe those who
laid the foundation are
real heroes.

Namibians and the cur-
rent Swapo government
have not yet mamied one
another. The truth is this
lies in the fact that what
Namibians want and what
Swapo can offer are two
different things. At the 9th
independence celebra-
tions Namibians must
start with a soul searching
exercise. Indeed we must
ask ourselves whether
Swapo is sull fit to rule
this country and if not
what is the alternative?

It is sad, however, that
many of us remain igno-
rant of what is really hap-
pening in this country. As
long as we benefit from
the system we are per-
suading everybody to say
that everything is okay.

However, the reality is

that everything is not

nghe.
