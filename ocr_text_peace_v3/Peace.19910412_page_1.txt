Services of Swawec, has al-
logedily refused to disclose either
the sum of money, said to be
millions of Rands, or the name
of the tenderer to remove
numerous anti-personnel mines
planted on the Ruacana-Om-
buru powerline.

These mines, which were
allegedly planted there to
**protect the powerline from
sabotage by Plan’’ guernilas,
has already inflicted casual-
ties in terms of lives and prop-

erty ofthe innocent local civil- |

ian population for several years.
Having intimate knowledge
of the discriminatory practices

of Swawec, I am not at all ,

surprised about the reported

wide discrepancies in the pnce

for removing such deadly anti-
mines.

But since Swawec is a par-
astatal corporation, | would
recommend that the Minister
of Mines and Energy, Andimba
Tetvo ya Toivo, institute a

into the

alleged discrepancies concerm-
ing the mine-removing tender-

Hooggenhout, should have
designed an electronic surveil-
lance system (o protect the
powerline. Altematively, if be,
for some reason, was unable to
design euch a system, only then
should he have asked the SADF
or Koevoet to regularly patrol
such powerline.

The steel pylons are ex-
tremely expensive and each
power pylon costs at least R10
000. And 400 would cost R4-
million. Also it is extremely

expensive and dangerous to |

remove those moves. Can you,
as an engineer, guarantee thal
no human life or pylon will be
destroyed in the process of
removing the mines, Mr
Hooggenhout? How much did

Swawec pay the SADF to
remove such mines?

If they had not been your ,

mines, Sir, then such R3 400
00 could have been used 1n the
trauning and re-traimng of ‘non-
white’ Namubians in order to
meet the letter and spint of
Article 23 (1) of the constitution.
