Ten Reasons Why Caprivi Should Get A New Name

ALLOW me to clear up
and elaborate on what has
become a controversial
hot potato on the name
change for Caprivi.

Who was Caprivi to
start with? Caprivi was a
German Captain in the
German colonial army.
Shortly before they were
defeated by the British
and the South African
forces, Captain Caprivi
and his forces quickly
decided in that short ses-
sion held at their Head-
quarters Schuckmanns-
burg to name the region
Caprivi in addition of the
existing Itenge name.

This was decided to
have a two-fold connota-
tion. Firstly as a landmark
that clearly states that the
entire Namibia was colo-
nised by Germany. Sec-
ondly, with the name
Caprivi intact it was easy

for Germany to reclaim
the entire country back
after the war and review
all signed agreements with
Britain.

A name change for
Caprivi is long overdue;
it was supposed to change
subsequently after inde-
pendence in 1990.
Change is inevitable and
we cannot run away from
ut.

Why the name change?

1. The name Caprivi has
no cultural link with
Namibians residing inthe
region viz Masubias.
Mafwes, Mayeyis and the
San people.

2. Caprivicuts short the
history of Mafwes,
Masubias, Mayeyis and
the San people whose his-
tory goes as farasthe 15th
century.

3.The scrambling of
African history teaches us

that most Afncans come
from the Great Lakes
where the name Caprivi
Never existed, hence it
only came alive in 1915.
(Note: languages existed
before the name Caprivi.)

4.The name Caprivi dis-
criminates hence all
Namibians residing there
cannot be called
Caprivian, only those born
there.(note: Capnivi is not
a language but a German
name.)

5.The name Caprivi
promotes rebellion and
secessionism since it im-
plies

Namibians who hail
from that region are from
a country other than the
Land of the Brave.

6. Caprivi assumes the
status of a different coun-
try, hence it ts the only
Namubian region that sub-
jugates citizens, viz, we

don't have Omahekeans,

Ohangwenians nor
Khomasians, why
Caprivians?

7.Caprivi should not be
compared to cities and
towns like Windhoek and
Tsumeb which explicitly
teflect their origin by
name. It is subject to
change without vote or
referendum to suit the pre-
vailing changes and de-
velopment, so as to bring
about peace in the coun-
try. Remember it is one of
the most troublesome re-

gions in the country.

8. The name Caprivihas
nothing in common with
Namibian people.

9.The name Caprivi
could have been a con-
tributing factor to the past
and ongoing tribal con-
flict in the region. Nobody
really knows its real mean-
ing. I'm aware the new
Name may not make
Katima Mulilo clean.

10. Caprivi is the only
Namibian region, which
is not indigenous - it has
no historical background

with its people.

The name praises
Caprivi and his father
Zipfel and indeed the en-
tire German people as he-
roes and will continue to
haunt us as long as it ex-
ists.

Having said that, my
choice of name is Zam-
bezi Region. It is neutral,
impartial andis Namibia’s
major tourist attraction.
Nearly everyone drinks
water from (the river). We
all live from it either di-
rectly or indirectly

through its fish In this way
we will remain Namibians
and will never be
‘Zambezians’.

Note: Contrary to your
version of how Caprivi
got its name, the strip of
land was named after
German Chancellor
Count von Caprivi. Let-

Viva Ndaitwah For Snub At UN Launch

I] WOULD be extremely pleased if you could publish
my reaction. I am basically writing in response to an
article which appeared in the Friday (August 31, 2001)
edition of your newspaper titled “Minister snubs UN

taunch”.

I think the Minister did the nght thing by ignoring the
launch of the so-called human development report. This

Minister should not even agree to talk to them before
they publicly apologise to the nation or publicly ac-
knowledge that this report was a mistake.

If they have no respect for us, there is no reason why
we should show them respect. It must be reciprocal. Is
this how they justify paying themselves hefty salaries

at

for doing nothing in Namibia? They are redundant in
