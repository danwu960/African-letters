whether the Minister knows
what is happening in the police
force and among the public as
well. I can assure him that the
accusations of the public are
not only aimed at the police
themselves, but against him as
well. °

The public is unhappy about
certain actions of the police
and feel there is room for lots
of improvement. As to your
repeated answer that you have
to report to the Cabinet, the
public knows that you are
accountable to them, but that
cannot stop you from improv-
ing the police.

The behaviour of the police
is Causing serious concern
among the public and reminds
them of the old colonial days.

Honourable Minister, your
answers on the Face to Face
programme were not satisfac-
tory tous, and the message we

would like to convey is that we

are looking forward to you
informing us about your find-
ings and whether our media
and the public at large would
like to live in a state of fear of
police suppression for ever.

On Walvis Bay

An open letter to
UN Secretary General
Dr Boutros Boutros Gali

IN VIEW of Namibia’s sec-
ond anniversary of independ-
ence, I would like to express
my deservedly deep concer
about parts of our country still
under foreign domination.

Writing straight to you proba-

bly reveals my ignorance re-
garding the ‘correct method’
of communicating with you.
However, deliberate depriva-
tion and annihilation during
the tragic colonial era would
justify my shortcomings. No
wonder, Namibia’s current
more than 50 per cent illiter-
acy rate. 7

Nowhere in the world, at
of Nations and subsequently
the United Nations’ existence,
were more resolutions passed,
defied, overlooked and/or for-
gotten than in the world body’s
former ‘baby’ for which it had

responsibility,

The long colonial years di-
lapidated both Namibia’s un-
renewable natural and human

Kher parts of the world are

still paying reparations to each
other after the two world wars.
Regardless of her plunder at
the expense of growth, pro-
duction, literacy and self-suf-
ficiency, Namibia has her sec-
ond anniversary of sovereignty
in debt and heavily dependent
upon imports.

Worse still, more than 90
per cent of her imported com-
modities are handled in Walvis
Bay, her only deepwater port.
Unfortunately, to our detriment,
Walvis Bay is apparently still
considered as part of South
Africa. Twelve, if not more of
Namibia’s offshore islands are
also still under South African
control, thus effectively reduc-
ing the area covered by the
country’s offshore rights by
about one-fifth.

If part of the world body’s _
responsibilities is to safeguard
peace, security, self-determi-
nation of member states: and
observation of good faith and
overwhelming justice towards
all nations, then Namibia de-
serves its long-violated rights
and national integrity honoured.
I therefore, on behalf of the
Namibian people, request your
organistion to ensure that jus-
tice prevails and that Walvis
Bay and the offshore islands
are retumed to the authentic
control of the indigenous popu-
lation - the Namibian people. I
should be grateful to see the
new world order incorporating
all parts of this fragile world.

| On police action

EVERYBODY seems to con-
demn the actions of the task _
force on March 3 at the Brew-
eries. To be honest, I cannot
condemn their actions in total

because of the involved inter-

ests that have to be balanced
equally. ot
On the one hand we have the
constitution that guarantees the
freedom to demonstrate peace-
fully and on the other we have
the duty of the police to main-
tain law and order (for example,
to prevent demonstrators bar-
ricading entrances).

Let us be honest with our- -
selves - it was clearly depicted
on TV that the demonstrators
were barricading the entrance
to the Breweries (and an inte]-
ligent person knows what the
consequences of this could be)
and the boulders used to barri-
cade the entrance couldalsobe
