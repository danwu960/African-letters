and therefore not their leader.

A wibal leader cannot be a national
leader at the same time. And Riruako
is being made to wither away as
Preaident of the DTA. Muyongo, using
the small amount of credibility he
gained as a result of being Vice Presi-
dent of Swapo, appears to have taken
over, but of course not beyond the
powers of Dirk Mudge who is the
long-sustained and indispensable
South African umbilical cord, with-
out which DTA cannot stand on its
own.

It is noexaggeration to say that the
DTA is essentially a mixture of
unmixable opposites. Most leaders
in the DTA - Mudge, Riruako,
Muyongo, Africa, Kashe - are not
Namibian leaders, but mba! ones.

Can the DTA therefore even talk
about a united Namibia, or one
Namibia one Nation?

Botha’s threat

I PERCEIVED with dismay the
threatening statement made by South
African Foreign Affairs Minister,
Roelof Botha, on his recent visit to
Windhock to the effoct that *‘if any-
thing unforescen happens between

| pew and Namibian independence,
piah violatcs any of the agreed

1 would like to remind the colonisers
that we did not invite South Africa to
invade our beloved Namibia and
subject it to colonialism and ql] that
gocs with it, and their presence
has always been illegal, nor did we
consent to the German fascism of
von Trotha.

We fought back tooth and nail
against these forces until today when
the deeply yearned-for freedom and
independence is about to be born.

We know South Afnca is not
committed to genuine implementa-
tion of 435; and if it was not for the
heavy burden of war, which the oc-
cupier could not sustain, then the
future of this country would still be
locked in chains.

If any ‘unforeseen’ happens in this
country, as Mr Botha fears, then it
will undoubtedly be the fault of Pre-
toria. Namibians are peace loving
people who have no intention of
invading other nations or neighbours.

Mr Botha should restrain his forces
and cease their clandestine activi-
ues. South Africa must not attempt
to create a pretext to invade this
country to perpetuate colonialism or
institute neo-colonialism.

It is unacceptable for the SADF or
SAP to returm to our soil under any
circumstances.

They should be restrained and
disciplined. This nation docs not want
the smell of blood while striving for
peace, stability and the right to na-

Uonhood.
