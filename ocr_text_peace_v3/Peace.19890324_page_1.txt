An open letter to

Mr Dirk Mudge

TO inwoduce myself, I am ¢
“Boartge’. bor in the south of Namibia
where the majority of super-duper

Mr Mudge, is what the people say,
true: namely, thal you as the crown
prince of the SWA National Party's
apertheid regime at che time of the
Tamhalle, was called upon by Preto-
Tia to form the super-aparthcid-alli-
ance, called the DTA, and then to do
away with petty apartheid so as to
prevent a total o1] embargo on South
Africa; then to form your all-white
perty, called the Republican Party?
(At that time all this was done in the
interest of South Africa). The people
say that you served Pretoria well -
ther wish was (and is) your com.
mand. They say thal, at the ume,
nobody except Swapo and the United
Nations were really serous re the
independence of Namibia, and they
say that only Swapo was prepared to
fight for the independence of Na-
mibia.

Is it truc, Mr Mudge, that up to this
day, you kept your Republican Paty a
super-duper spartheid-party by clos-
img the party's doors to other than
whites, and that this was the reason
why Mr Kalangula left the DTA?

Is it not true that the DTA, similar
to AG 8, is super-aparthcid in accor-
dance with the wishes of the masters
across the Orange River?

Am | wrong in saying that, in
1948, the Nats, of which you were at

happy”

Is st not ue that 90 percent of the
votes which the DTA will draw, will
come from ow non-white fellow.
countrymen? Do you think that they
wl then, after they gave your Alli
ance the majonty vote, take a back
scat, like in the past, when the Preto
na regime gave the DTA and the
Puppets the dnver and the front scats
on the puppet tain? No, Mr Mudge.
unless | am wrong. you won't even
be in the guard's van! If the DTA
should win, we shall sull have anon-
white government which, if the DTA's
lies re Swapo were truc, will still
land us in the same boat.

Am I wrong, Mr Mudge, in belicv-
ing that the DTA will not lift a finger
to get Walvis Bay as OUR harbur,
even be it only for the sake of justice
and fairness (because Pretoria won't
like it, as they will then not be under
our blanket from where they could
pracucally contro! our economy and
easily start disinvesting against a
regime in Namibia which do not favour
their pleasure - did not the State
President of South Africa already
threaten to do 907)

Am | wrong if I say that you will
not lift a finger to introduce our own
currency and rid us of the valucless
rand, which was born out of hatred of
the English and to please the apart-
heid-syndrome at the time of the
visions?

Am I wrong, Mr Mudge, If | aay
that Sowh A ia financing the
DTA in the coming election and that,
If the DTA should win the election,

South Afnca will tell you and the
DTA that you owe them, that you
must now brush your teeth and sing
(which means back to square one -
Serve the masters faithfully)?

Mr Mudge, I beg of you, don't let
the DTA try and ghost us with thumb-
sucking stones and by doing 80, also
uy to frighten the hell out of us. Let
us rather have the facts re the DTA's
pnnciples and policy on how the
DTA intends ruling Namibia and
guiding us to peace and stability in
order to take our nightful place in the
world. Please, I ask this of you and
the DTA for the well-being of the
chilren of Namibia, and to help us
make the night decision.

Mr Mudge, if it pleases you, I still
have questions to ask, bocause I want
clanty before 1 decide for whom to
vote - Swapo or the.DTA.

Therefore, do me the honour to
answer my questions through The
Namibian, because 1 prefers to com-
municate in our future official len-
guage (or will it bo Afrikaans if the
DTA wins?)
