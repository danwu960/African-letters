‘Land
conference

i WOULD like to publish this
noble request in the name of
| the fallen owners, heroes and
currently living heirs. May I
also have the privilege to shortly
dwell on the sad history of
Namibia. .

Numerous volumes have
been written on the treachery,
robbery, murder and ulti:
the total colonisation of my
country. The Germans, some
boasting generations here, were
the first, followed by the South
Africans. In the Present-day
independent Namibia the South |
African and German colonial- |
ists here, misusing the
constitution and its contents,
inter alia the socalled racon-
ciliation, are of the intent to |
manipulate the Land Confer-
ence in their favour.
Sight should never be lost
«that amibia historically, cul-

rurally and politically belongs |
| to the San, Ovambos, Hereros, |
| Nantes, Darmaras, Caprivians, |
