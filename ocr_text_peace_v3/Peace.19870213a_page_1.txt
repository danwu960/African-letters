7 Year of unity
| anbkly-a th and faded away as
the rainbow and 1967 has
ratte For us, the struggling
masses of Namibia, it is now time to
reflect on the happenings of the past
year. Was it a successful year as far
_ as the struggle is concerned? Did we
achieve what we set out to achieve,
and if not why?

First of all we must find answers
to these questions before we can plan
for the new year. The aim of our plan-

should be to make a success out
of failures of the past and to
achieve our independence. It is aleo
now time for us to state our aims and
purpose as clearly as never before.
We should state our views without
fear or favour.

Our aim was and is and always
shall be the independence of our
country. It must be every Namibianâ€™s
wish and desire to be free ... and |
mean free in the real sense of the
word. -

Our independence is not
negotiable. We have negotiated for
too long hence the long delay in ob-
taining our desired independence.
Our direction should be very clear ...
independence now and at all coats.
We should stop these half-hearted ef.
forts. We should go all out to liberate
our country. |

The call and onus is on us to unite
the divided people of Namibia into
one cohesive liberation front or
movement.

The unity I am talking about is not
unity for the sake of shouting that we
are united ... 1 mean unity of purpose
and action ... the purpose being our
liberation. We must have the purpose
of fighting the common enemy and
even more ... to defeat the enemy. We
have nothing to lose but our chains.

We must learn from our mistakes
and those of our forefathers and rec-
tify them before it is too late. We
should also learn from other African
countries.

The time for talk about unity is
long overdue. It is now time to act
unity. It is time to involve all the
Namibians in the unity of purpose
process,

The masses must ask their leaders
to unite them for the sake of our in.
