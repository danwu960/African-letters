The things mentioned in that
report are occurrences at schools
resorting under Nationa] Education.
Many of them are undernourished,
and they are also locked up, like at
the Augustineum, where students
are afraid of the Koevoet security

When I look at what happens at
State schools, I do not feel bad about
the situation in which myself and my
colleagues at church schools find
ourselves. What happened at the
Augustineum, Mr Matjila? There
they are locked up and are forbidden
from participating in student
organisations, such as Nanso.

This is a sign that their rights have
been taken away. We are happy to be
at church schools, because our minds
are free, and we have the opportuni.
ty to air our political views.

Mr Matjila, think before you speak.
Leave the church schools in peace.

Myself and fellow Namibian
students dream of the day when
equal and fair education will be
granted to all. Education without
liberation is worthless.
