peace, stability and a decent shot at
economic prosperity and national
reconstruction can be’ achieved in
Namibia.

The simple fact is that negotiations
between Swapo and South Africa or
between other Namibian parties and
South Africa, will not achieve this. It
can only be achieved in negotiations
between Namibians espousing dif.
fereint views.

We understand why Swapo wishes to
sign a ceasefire agreement with South
Africa and why it does not wish to
negotiate with other Namibian par.
ties. By signing a ceasfire with South
Africa, Swapo wil! gain prestige and
will be seen as the winner.

In struggle

I WOULD like to refer to an announce-
ment in a recent radio programme
stating that churchleaders should not
be involved in politics. Why is this the
case?

Obviously churchleaders are our
guides in the struggle. They are the
ones who can truly solve problems,
especially regarding the “beatings
and torture” by Koevoet in northern

Namibia.

Churchleaders must be involved in
politics because they are true
peacelovers of Namibia who are strug-
gling for peace and freedom; because
they love their people and country, they
must try to defend their people by tell-
ing Koevoet members to stop their
intimidation.

Churchleaders, keep it up! Do not be
intimidated.

AN OPEN LETTER TO
DR JORDAAN

TAKE note that the people of Otimb-

noted critically the undesirable
medical care service that your health
department offers to our people here,
and demanded drastic changes (nee at-
tached petition).

However, after almost a month your
department seems Virtually incon.
siderate towards the rotten medical
service and the lives of the people your
government claims to protect and
govern. To be sure, your department
has not moved even an inch torespond
to the demands of the people. Dr
Wagner continues still, and the State
clinic is not yet properly equipped.

So, if theee conditions remain, we
