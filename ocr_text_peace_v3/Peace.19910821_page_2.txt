in Namibia against
the will of the inhabitants. If
the socalled revelation came
from Chief Mamili directly,
then he should apologise to the
Namibian nation for the in-
converences provoked by the
violent. demonstration and the
subsequent damage to peace
and nation-building.

The prefabricated allegation
that the recently appointed
people in the Ministry of Edu-
cation are unqualified, is a case
of character assassination and
if | were them, ! would take
you to court.

If Chief Mamili is a real
cluef as he claims, he should
stop listening to Mishake
Muyongo who wants to ac-
complish his political ambi-
uions of divide and rule.

In this patriotic process of
moulding a nation, the concept
of championing tribalism should
be looked at as a political lia-
bility that is detrimental to
nation-building. Caprivi as an
integral part of Namibia be-
longsto all Namibiansand still
knows no boundary.
