Saluting Ponhofi

I WOULD like to air my views on the
socalled leaders of Uukwanyama’sre-
centcal for army reinforcement inthe
region.

In the first place, I would like to
salute my comrades, fellow students of
Ponhofi Secondary School, who called
upon the SADF to withdraw from the
region, in particular the Ovambo Ad.
ministration and many other victims
of the racist Pretoria regime.

Inthe second place I would like to in.
form Messrs Kwautima, Dan and
Nghihulifwa and their disciples in the
region that we want freedom and not
AD extension and intensification of op-
‘pression and victimisation as is the
case in the north presently. [f Mr

Kwautima genuinely wants freedom
and security then he should fight for
the implementation of Resolution 435.

Itseemsthat the men in question do
not know what Resolution 435 is. They
simply believe that Koevoet wil! bring
stability in the region.

IfKwautima, Nghihulifwa and their
followers cannot exist without the ar-
my and Koevoet, then they should go
together with them, and leave Nami-
bians in peace,

Kwautima claimed over Radio
Owambo that even Chief Mandume
had soldiers. This may be, but Man-
dume did not fight his fellow Nami-
bians but fought the same colonialism
which we Namibians are fighting
against today. How can Kwautima
compare himself with a man like
Mandume?

Whatever Kwautima does, he and
his followers will never win the people's
hearts and minds. Students of Ponhofi,
you must not be intimidated by these
people. You must not surrender your
attitude of resistance tothe SADF We
are all with you and behind you.

We shall not be intimidated by South
African surrogates and their puppets.
The army and Koevoet must pack up
and go.
