Put some flesh on the bone.

I hail from Kenya, an African
Commonwealth member that had
had the nascent occasion of hold-
marred and fraught with all de-
generacy that may sccompany
elections gone haywire, making
the Zimbabwean experience look
like an act from the Vatican. This
was in 1992 and 1997 respectively,
when President Moi won in both
instances, enduring a tight reign
on power that he has stretched to
24 years, two better than Mugabe.
Kenya goes to elections again this
year. What happened in these two
elections was worse than Zimba-
bwe. Presidents Mui and Mugabe
are two of akind; they are the most
unpopular leaders who rule agn-
cultural states that were formerly
British colonies. They are birds of
the same feather, with Moi presid-
ing over the most gross human
rights violations ever witnessed in
post-colonial Kenya, arming and

Mugabe forthwith renounces un-

fete him as a visionary who has
come in from the cold. But will
he? He has been feted before and
feels personally betrayed, almost
cast into political oblivion before
clinging to the last saving grace,
the land issue. Like asnake hunter,
he now strikes the head and
sees the pain resonate beyond
Zimbabwe. He persists and he ts
not about to let go.

If the elections are anything to
go by. Mugabe, like any other
despotic leader, has followers. al-

his clique are not unduly disqui-
