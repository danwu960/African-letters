A confused man

THERE IS a considerable number of
Namibians who really do not unders-
tand the historical process through
which we are going, particularly with
regard to the armed struggle against
the colonial occupation of this country
by the SA regime. The socalled Veripi
Mungunda is one of them.

In his letter dated July 17, he made
serious, irresponsible and reactionary
statements. In the first one, he alleges
that Swapo has no popular supporter.
I, the writer of this letter, would like to
challenge him to travel through the
country and test the popular support
of Swapo by questioning the masses on
the credibility of Swapoasa liberation
movement. If he did this, he would
definitely clear out his brainwashed
mind.

As far as his second statement iscon-
cerned; which implies that Swapo
makes use of the Council of Churches
and Namibian facilities in order to
carry out its political activities, my
question is: is their anything wrong
with it? Is it wrong for peace loving peo-
ple and genuine Namibians to gather
together, to thrash out the good from
the bad? No; Mr Mungunda. Once
again, you're confused. In the Nami-

‘bian context the CCN and The Nami-

bian’s Editor forms the good, while the

alliance between the Namibia Chur-

ches Union(NCU) and Nudo, form the
ad.

The latter is a grouping on tribal
lines to delay the process to freedom.
Andatill you deliberately come out in
support of those people who are in-
directly responsible for the atrocities
co against innocent people in
this country.
