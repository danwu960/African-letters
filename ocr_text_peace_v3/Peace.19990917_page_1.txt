ALLOW me to say something about the situation
in Caprivi. The people from Caprivi, I take it,
understand the situation better than other Na-
mibians. Onlookers see the situation in many dif-
ferent ways including Chief Riruako, the NHSR
and the Opposition’s views.

Butall these are partially right or wrong and the
truth of the matter is that tf you harbour bad
feelings about others you end up getting hated
yourself!

The tribal animosity that the Linyant: tribal
authority has been nurturing.

The amalgamation of tribes into a single Mafwe
tribe, the conflict that raged on between the
Masubia and the Mafwe which later spilled over to
the Mayeyi and saw a spat of roadblocks, beatings.
shooungs and the killings of two teachers, one at
Sachona and one at Linyanti, the resistance against
the government, threats of death and finally the
flight to Botswana are all signs of the times and a
bad outcome.

The security forces were prompt otherwise we
would have seen worse. The whole source of the
matter is power, both tribal and political, with
empty promises made by Muyongo to his cohorts.

He thought fighting for it would be the easiest
way, but he underestimated the government, and
the poor followers out of despair just followed
blindly. Who is then to blame? Of course not the
security forces nor the government, but Muyongo

himself. [have strong beliefs that human rights are
universal

Both the dying and living have nghts that need
to be recognised equally. We know lawyers are
making money out of the situation, but this should
not undermine the rights of others Ttis interesting
to hear from a certain lawyer that he condemns the
activines of the rebels but at the same time hes the
one pocketing money from the same people for
their defence - what a double standard Would ut
therefore not be interesting to find out how those °
photos got to the media if there was money
involved and if this 1s so to what degree 1s this
professional? Namibians should put the blame
where it 1s due

This was a very unfortunate self-sought situa-
tion, the security forces therefore performed their
national duties as expected of them One wonders
what national role rebels were fulfilling apart
from committing abominations.

If you put your hand 1n a hole where a snake ts
you should face the consequences of the outcome.
Let the government carry out its constitutional
responsibility which 1s the protection of the Ssov-
ereignty and democracy of this country.

Peace 1s a precious commodity and cannot be
allowed to be messed up by those who think they
can take out their frustrations on innocent citizens
T call on all peace loving Namibians to stand wih
government to defend the peace this country has
dearly earned.

of any truth whatsoever. F; urther, the lawyer
