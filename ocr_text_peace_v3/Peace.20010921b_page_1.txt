Living In Hell

1 AM sure that every peace-loving citizen of this planet
was horrified by the senseless loss of life when America
was altacked, but believe me some others were celebrat-
ing this massacre, just (o remind us that we are living in
hell on this planet.

To every Amencan who has lost a father, mother,
sister, brother, son, daughter and friend there is only one
being who can console you in times like this and that is
the Lord our God. Take refuge in Him since there is no
cross too heavy for Him to carry.

The big and powerful US has a long history of
imperialism which has created an established array of
enemies, ie. fanatics, extremists, fundamentalists, mili-
tants of all types. The US had been assisting people like
Savimbi, the late Mobutu Seseko and many African
dictators and the former minority apartheid regime of
South Africa. Also through the 1960s the Vietnam war;
the steadfast support of Israel; and economic sanctions
and other steps against Iraq without stopping. All these
resulted in death of innocent civilians.

I do not support killing of innocent people whoever
commits such acts, whether they be fanatics or Ameri-
cans or whoever. However, the American people must
keep aneye on the foreign policy of their country. Ifthey
see that the policy ts wrong they must make it known to
their government that it is wrong. If they keep quiet than
they agree to what America Is doing in foreign countnes
or they will continue to perish in such attacks.

The US will investigate this attack and dispatch
missiles accordingly to those supposed to be responsi-
ble for this attack. That will be revenge and in turn the
extremists will react again.

Revenge is not for human beings to take, revenge ts
reserved for Gad. Since after every act of revenge more
innocent civilians will dic. After all this who will be the
good one and who will be the bad one? Both will be bad
since they kill innocent civilians.

If peace and Jove could be bought with money America
could have been the country of choice to five in. Love ts
to sit down and listen to the poorest personâ€™s problems.
to try to solve them and assist to the best of your ability,
even those who hate you. Let God be with the Amencan
people especially those who lost dear ones, to have the
strength to gothrough this hell. Let the Lord also be with
those responsible for the attack before they fall into the
same hell they created tor others.
