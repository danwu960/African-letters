one who dealt with me at the

Tribe after tribe

{ AM an Ovambo-speaking man
who is very disappointed with his
fellow countrymen.

1 was told I could get a job in the
building construction industry’ in
Tsumeb, and had to see a man at
the Tsumeb Municipality. He told
me to come back the following
morning at 07h00, which I did, and
he made me wait all day. I was
eventually told I could not get the
job, and then after a friend of mine
again requested, I was told to go
to the Municipality once again.

When J did so, the man told me
there were no jobs for Ovambo-
speaking people, but only
Damaras, Namas and Coloureds.

Some of our brothers in govern-
ment offices treat others on a tribal
and discriminatory basis. While the
Ovambo-speaking people are those
who are suffering the most, one has
to hear that they are ‘thieves and
terrorists’, and they are
discriminated against in job
situations.

| had used my own money to go
to Tsumeb for that job, and had no
place to sleep and nothing to eat.

Blacks alwavs blame the whites
for discrimination and racism, but
some of our own people, like the

Municipality, are oppressing their
own people.

We should learn from these
mistakes so we should not make the
same mistakes tn the future.

Our country is torn by war and
this situation will only be resolved
if the people of the country can
work hand in hand for peace. This
peace will only come through love,
and an understanding of our duty
to the nation, and if we forget the
differences among ourselves and
see one another as brothers and

, sisters who are equal before God.
