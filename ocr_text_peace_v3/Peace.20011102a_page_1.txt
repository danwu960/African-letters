Why Do Certain Nations Behave The Way They Do?

VIOLENCE and terronsm
are no way for creating
peaceful and stable socie-
ties, which embrace norms
and standards that are gen-
crally seen to be univer-
sally acceptable. Differ-
ences in ethnicity, culture

and religion will occasion-
ally present sigmificant
problems, but we are re-
quired to dead with these
and to find solutions that
are meaningful and sustain-
able - not go to war.

We have recently come

to recognise the gulf of
understanding between the
Muslim and non-Muslim
world. From an ethical and
moral perspective, there are
very few differences re-
garding principle, but there
1s a very big difference in

perception. Why is it that
the Taliban and Muslims in
Saud: Arabia, for instance,
interpret the Q'ran so dif-
ferently? Is it merely fun-
damentalism building uputs
own head of steam on the
one hand, and Arab hedon-
ism built upon oil wealth
on the other, of is there
more oul there that we
should be aware of ?

Why are some nations
invanably so predictable?

That question 1s now
being asked about Amenca.
Though there is a clearly
understood difference be-
tween the Amencan peo-
ple and their Administra-
tion, itis the psyche of the
nabion that gives cause for
concern. In discussion
many Americans will ad-
mit that their government
leaves much to be desired,
yet their use of the ballot-
box does little to change
the status quo. Many
Amencan friends and col-
leagues understand and
share the concerns of those
living outside the borders
of the USA. but are power-
less to do anything con-
strucuve. Big Brother is
invasive and insidious!!!

There ts a brutal streak in
the psyche of the Amen-
can people. The USA might
be the most powerful world
poweronthe planetto-day.
but lis not the most civi-
hsed! It sull practices capi-
tal pumishment and ex-

ecutes human beings in the
most horrendous and bi-
zarre ways devised by so-
called modem man. From
passing thousands of volts
of electneity through the
human body to lethal injec-
tions, and all in the name of
justice, must rank as the
crueflest indictment of civt-
lised norms and standards!
The Amencan people have
come to believe that this ts
how one exacts justice’
They tum itintoa spectacle
by watching 1¢ on closed
circult television in true
Hollywoodian fashion!
Can anything else be more
bizarre, or more brutalis-
ing? Yes, watching Afghan
women and children scat-
ter for their lives while
American bombs rain
down, is more bizarre and
brutal!!
Nottotalk of weapons of
mass destruction! America
1s the only country on the
planet to have dropped an
atomic bomb on another
country. The immediate
destruction was bad
enough, bul what about the
nuclear fallout, not just for
Japan but for the region?
Ord Amenca care? They
regarded thal as a major
achievement in the annals
of technology and modem
warfare! So much for car-
ing about the planet! And
the refusal of the Bush Ad-
ministration to sign the
Kyoto Accord, what does

that say about commitment
to the well-being of the
planet and the rest of us
mortals whoare not Amen-
cans? And the use of agent
orange in Vietnam, was
that humane?

It is my bebef that the
power and might of the
Amencan people ts par-
ually based on their dam-
aged psyche. Insttutional-
ised violence and brutality
desensitises them to the
feelings, aspirations and
sensitivities of the rest of
the world. A judicial sys-
tem based on brutality can-
Not create justice, Just as
war and destruction can
never bring about peace

After the hberation strug -
gle, both South Africa and
Namibiaremovedthe death
sentence from their legal
systems. None of our op-
pressors and persecutors
was condemned to death,
and no Nuremberg-type tn-
als were held to revenge
the deeds of the past, dur-
ing which thousands also
lost their lives over many
decades. Instead, we opted
for reconcihation, and we
are all the better for that
This self-same apartheid re-
gime in South Afnca was
supported by the USA as
was Unita in Angola. Bill
Clinton's administration
went as far as requesting
the De Klerk governinent
(o ensure thal no nuclear
technology fell into the

hands of the Mandela-Ied
ANC government, because
they could not trust the new
black leaders! They were
happy to throw their lotin
wath the white panah racist
regime, bul they would not
trust the new black govern-
ment.

No. we do not need any
form of moralising from
those who backed our erst-
while persecutors. We par-
Ucularly have no interest in
being on ‘their side!” Back-
ing ourselves cenainly does
not imply backing terror.
win and that is what the
Bush administration is so
clumsily trying tointer nits
statement that “we are et
ther with them or against
them!”

Amencans need to di-
vest themselves of the no-
tion of revenge as a means
of creating a peacctul
word. They can do so by
distancing themselves from
their own forms of institu-
tuonalised woltence, which
they mistakenly believe to
be justice. And they can
begin to show some regard
for the mithons of us who
are not Amencans, and who
do not share all of their
values. ethics and morals
notwithstanding

The restofthe world docs
NOT have to catch a cold
when Amenca sneezes!
