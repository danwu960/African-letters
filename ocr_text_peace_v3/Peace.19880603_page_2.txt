lam very worried about the colonial
behaviour of some of the so-called
tribal chiefs in Owambo known as
Gabriel Kautwima and Mr Gottlieb
Dan. These two men are some of the
leaders of the colonial organisation
known as ‘“‘Etango”’ inOwambo. They
are still refusing the removal of the
racist military-base at Ponhofi Secon-

dary School which caused the the loss

of many lives in the surrounding areas.
especially of the Ponhofi-students.
They are ncw encouraged by the
Administrator-General, Louis
Pienaar, who hasrecently announced
that the military base at Ponhofi will
not be removed.

Please you two chiefs, are you 80
blinded by P W Botha that youcan't see
how your nation is suffering under the
Botha-regime who is using you as his
protectors? Do you know who Mr Louis
Pienaar is? Do you know who he
represents here? He is not and wil
never represent the Namibian people!
He is there for the benefit of the racist
South Africa, to protect and promote
the crucial laws and policies of South
Africa.

Louis Pienaar has nothing todo with
the demands of the majority of the
Namibian people.

You, Kautwima and Dan have recent-
ly said that your lives are worth more
than those hundreds of young suffer-
ing Namibian students. This only
shows that you lack patriotic feelings
and instead represent the racist-
Botha-government.

It seems as if you are not far from tak-
ing an oath of allegiance in the South
African Government, like Mr. Moses
Katjiongua have done, who is ignoring
his own people and instead protecting
South Africa’s racist policies and laws.

The Namibian people are demanding
peace, justice, self-detemination and
independence brought by the im-
plementation of Resolution 435. ] am
challenging you to personally attend
a Swapo-rally one day, to see how the
majority of the Namibian people ex-
press their willingness for the in-
dependence brought about by Swapo
and Resolution 435.
