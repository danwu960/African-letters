WE read with shock and dismay the
artcle by the “brave” but nameless
“Editorial staff members’ of Namibia
Today. This article is an unambiguous
declaranon of war by this newsletter
and 1 am ready tw enter the battle
whatever the consequences.

The so-called wrong platform: The
memonal service took place in the
Epbesians congregaton of the Evan-
gelical Lutheran Church in the Repub-
be of Namibia and for the information
of the ‘Editorial staff members’ I am
the Bishop of that Church. Thus, |
used my own platform.

The late comrade Hilukilwa
Kandanga was a member of my
Church. She was not only a heroine,
but also a wue Namibian who did not
only condemn tibalism with her words

was correct, and within the right con-
text. It is also obvious that I would not
ask permission from Namibia Today,
or anyone clse, for what I said on my
own platform!

My so-called attack on Swapo: At
no Stage during my sermon did I men-
ton the Swapo party or any tribe. | was
also not exclusive in what I said, but
very inclusive. I called on alll of us, the
former oppressed Namibians, to also
book at ourselves and to correct what is
wrong with us. The ‘editorial staff
members" accuse me of lies but they
are shameless when they fabricate what
I did not say.

I thank the Right Honourable Prime
Minister and his Excellency the Presi-

said and what the Prime Minister said?
All three of us condemned tribalism
and corruption in public and not be-
hind closed doors “at the right place,
and had it handled in line with the
culture and long established practice
of debate and mature discussions that
prevails in the Swapo party”.

Does this by implication mean that
the statements of the President and
Prime Minister on these issues are
outbursts and tribal antics and are also
regarded by Namibia Today as outra-
geous, despicable, and wild? This is
indeed the conc husion of all nght-think-

I believe firmly that derogstory
expressions, whether they are used by
whites or blacks, should be banned
from the face of the independent and

mise on this, for the sake of the unity,
