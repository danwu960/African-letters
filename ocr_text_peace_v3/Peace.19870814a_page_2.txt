_ Namibians have never invited the
presence of South Africa, nor protec-
tion of any kind for that matter. None
of our real elected leaders did (lipum-
bu, Maharero, Witbooi, Kutako etc).

Andsoit continues that thecry ofthe
Namibian masses still vanishes into
the annalsof boguscommunist/marn.
ist threats and makeshift supremacy
ofthe minority.

For how long is innocent Nanubian
blood going tooverflow the arid and dry
riverbeds of this place? For how long
now have the presidents and prime
ministers of Trans-Oranje preached
that the inhabitants of this country
will decide their own destiny?

But still the colonial master is rul-
ing with an iron fist; their companies
still rummaging the distant hills for
our natural resources; their police still
brutally assaulting our innocent peo-
ple, not because of what they say, but
because of their black skins.

Still our children are deprived of
basic education - they are not - unlike
the whites, forced legally to attend
school up toa certain age; the creation
of a semi-skilled black society to
hamper the revolution of the skilled
majority; the stealing of our fish under
the pretext of development; the legalis-
ed system of plundering and assault of
unarmed civilians; the lies of many of
those engaged in the system, the im-
position of an unelected puppet govern-
ment. These and others, are the order

of the day. . .
But still the ‘Capi du tut Capi’ of

racism speaks, 1n contradiction to

what he does, of reconciliation and

peace. Pretoria ignores, with pro-

vocative contempt, thecry of the Nam)-

bian people: implement Resolution
