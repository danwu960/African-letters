“THERE is another sfde tothe story of I-
the socalled “Ten years of peace in East
Caprivi’ (The Windhoek Advertiser,
August 26). It has not had ten years of
peace as Brigadier Gert Nel suggests:
it HAS been ten years of humiliation
and intimidation.

Iregard this report as an attempt to
invalidate the very succeasful Swapo
rally held in the region on August 20,
as well as to discredit Caprivians in the
eyes of fellow Namibians. Brigadier
Nel’s long report on the socalled ‘peace’
is mere propaganda.

Leaders have been intimidated and
harassed by the SADF and its counter-
part, Swapol, formerly SAP. The socall-
ed ‘leaders’, as claimed by Brigadier
Nel, are instruments used to further
the prevailing status quo. The tradi-
tional leaders are merely the
equivalents of the Katjiuonguas and
Matyilas of Namibia.

As regards what Brigadier Nel calls
‘cooperation’ between the army and
civilians, I have the following to say:

* intense psychological war is at work
in the region; :
* the people do not admire the SADF
or SWATYF, because it is not their army,
but South Africa's, The civilians may
‘cooperate’ with the army because they
need to survive; but it is not out of their
own will. Their fear is legitimate.

The bitter irony behind the creation
of 701 Battalion is that most young
men have joined the army as a last
resort. The rate of unemployment in
Caprivi is so high that people are left [
with two major options: to join the ar-
my, undesirable as that is, or become
a teacher. |

The SADF and Swapol have repress-
ed any sign of protest so that may give
an illusion of ‘peace’ in the region.

Regarding Enok/FNDC, this com-
pany may be credited with
monopolistic and exploitative prac-
tices in the region. It is notorious for
paying low wages; and they are cer-
tainly not contributing to any develop-
ment worth mentioning. |

The SWABC is nothing other thana
mouth piece of the interim government
and ita masters in Pretoria. It is also
used to disseminate the kind of pro-
paganda which Brigadier Nel
 Brigadios Na

gadier Nel should not am
