your newspaper to express
my sincere thanks to those
teachers who taught me
throughout my life. Now
that we are completing our

Grade 12 it’s time for us
to become both produc-

of our country. [owe my
sincere thanks to our lead-
ers who liberated our

Note To Readers —

country and made it safe
for us to study in a peace-
ful atmosphere.
