| THE DTA-MPC newspaper seems 10

No-one in Namibia can believe MPC supports Resoluaaey 3

‘be trying once again to destroy any
attempts by the blacks in this coun-
try to get together and do something
for their country. I am referring to its
recent paternalistic reporting on the
attempt by Dr A Shejavali, General
Secretary of the Council of Chur-
ches, to get together all parties which
- are honestly supporting Resolution
435.
~ Onlya fool would expect this Party
Newspaper to show any support for
amove to unite the oppressed Nami-
bians, but the arrogance of its Editor
can no Jonger be ignored. In the edi-
_ tion of February 3 the ‘wise guy’ of
Namibian ‘journalism’ takes up issue
with what he refers to as the ‘cienaar-
dige inisiatief of Dr Shejavali.
Firstly he decides on what grounds
this initiative will enjoy the support
of all of them. Namely if the aim is

to get the parties outside the ‘puppet
show’ more approachable. The ques-
tion is: approachable for whom? His

group?

He actually has the cheek to
assume that these parties want to be
approachable to the surrogates of
South Africa, when all one has iodo
1s to deal with South Africa itself. He
then advises Dr Shejavali which par-
ties he should have approached if he
were interested in reconciliation -
namely the litle groups inthe MPC.

The poor man is such a victim of
his own propaganda that he actual-
ly believes they want ‘reconciliation’
while they are beating up people at-
tending a peace raily and detaining
people under AG 9 and 26.

The writer of the editorial is upset
because Dr Shejavali ignored the
people in the puppet show. If he had
read the invitation he would have

realised that it is not Dr Shejavali, but
the agenda of the planned meeting,
which excludes those in the MPC. It
is clearty stated in the invitation that
parties will discuss Resolution 435 as
n stands. Nobody in Namibia can
still believe the MPC supports
Resolution 435. They have proven
their opposition so often.

Who remains for Dr Shejavali to
speak to, he asks: | would like to in-
form him a littl. Net to Justus
Garoeb, but tothe Damara Council,
which has openly stated its support
of Resolution 435 and which has
more support than Shipanga, Kat-
yluongua, Mudge and the rest of the
Bevryders, Arbeiders and NP put
together. Not to Peter Kalangula, but
to the CDA whose legitimacy has
been adequately proven by the
dismal failure of elements in the ar-
my and government to topple him,

and which supports Resolution 435.

Not the Swanu ‘dissidents’, but
Swanu under the leadership of
Kuzeeko Kangueehi, Swanu which
never dissented from its constitution
and policy, Swanu which supports
the implementation of Resolution
435,

Other parties of which this ‘jour-
nalist’ is unaware are the Mbanderu
Council, the NIP, Nudo Pro-
gressives, Nanso and Namibia
Women’s Voice.

The soothsayer of Namibian
political journalism predicts that it
will be impossible to get these parties
together. He obviously already has
information about this. Is it Koevoet
or the security police who will stop
the meeting?

He predicts that in the event of uni-
ty being formed, it. will Be unity in
dissension. Surely this is the business

cota

is united on AG 8, the nat - oa
Teport, or a policy for. deWloping

give concrete evidence of It: :
Why are the whlsesyerried whien
the CCN wants todo for the opprese-
ed what the NG Kerk hasbeendoing =
for the whites for years? Whyisthis.
‘journalist’ worried whenthe CCN
starts a unifying process but not —~
when Mr Cleary, working for South

Africa, started the MPC? Mustany

initiative start with whites, mustitbe
pro South African?
