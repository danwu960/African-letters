Namibians are not
brainwashed

| WEEP FOR MY COUNTRY,
which has been conquered by
force, and in which oppression and
immorality reigns supreme. The
country in which people have lost
their human dignity, the country
where we are nov treated like
foreigners ...

if anyone enjoys a bit of luck or
finds himself a little better off, im-
mediately his heart grows hard. In
our time people who think only of
themselves are wicked.

No one knows my despair, save
He who knows all, but my heart is
in a perpetual state of anguish.

Our oppressors should know
that Namibians are not brain-
washed and we will never be blind-
folded. Justbecause wesmile and
smile, and happiness is our coat,
they think we are gateposts, numb
to the stab of pain.

Just because of the laughter on-

our lips and our eyes lowered in
respect, you think we are like

stones.

This is our fatherland which has
been pillaged by foreign con-
querors who have exploited and
grown rich on the spoils of our
nation.

Itis time to abolish apartheid. Let
our brothers in South Africa enjoy
peace, equality, freedom and
justice.

Let the world know our problems,
and let us share our problems with
them. Let us demand the im-
plementation of Resolution 435, so
that victory for Namibia will be
achieved.
