fact that rugby matches are well-

monitored by the police (Last week-
end's match against Wales for ex-
ample). You can make your own
companisons in this regard. Purther,
itisnot the job of a reporter to initiate
meetings between the police and soccer
administrators. That's your job. His
is to report on events as they occur.
The Namibian supports the idea of a
police force to maintain and uphold
public order. Its a new concept for
most Namibians who have in the past
seen the police as their enemy (in
most cases, quite rightly so) since the
latter have acted against political
opponents in most cases. So its up to
the police to prove the ms¢lves to the
public in order to cam their trust and
confidence.

Lastly, Brigadier, don’t make such
laughable statements such as ‘‘why
you and some of your staff seck
opportunities to discredit the gov-
emment of the Republic of Namibia”’.
You know quite well that this is not
the issue here. - Gwen Lister.

On forgiveness

TRY forgiving a friend who betrays
a confidence, or a co-worker who
telJs lies about you. When the real
effort of forgiveness takes place, there
is nothing easy about it. Instinct urges
us to pay back in kind.
Some people are capable of heroic
effort in reconciling: others not. There
is usually a pause between the hurt
and the time when trust and love can
take root again. Forgiveness is part
of a process that begins with hurt and
ends, inits final goal, with reconcili-
atjon.
It works only when we become aware
of the depths and causes of the ange:
burning in us so that we can forgive
wholeheartedly and ensure anendur-
ing peace.
Too often, we bypass forgivencss
entirely. We race from our hurtto an
arent reconciliation without tak-
ing stock of what must truly be for-
given before lasting healing can take
place. We try to get past the difficult
part too quickly,“for we havo been
since childhood to keep

whether deliberate or accidental.
The ability to reconcile cannot be
tushed. We owe it to one another to
offer time to confront our hurts, to
face our wounds head-on, to vent our
emotions. Only then can the real
healing begin.

When Jesus said ‘love your enemy’,
he meant every word of it. We never
get rid of an enemy by meeting hate
with hate; wo get nd of an enemy by
getting rid of enmity.
Reconciliation depends on the situ-
alion and the people involved. In the
end, all forgivers do the same thing:
they restore self-worth to the of-
fender; they cancel a debt; they expe-
rience such peace that they lose the
urge to retaliate and live as freer
persons unshackled by the weight of
a hurt.
