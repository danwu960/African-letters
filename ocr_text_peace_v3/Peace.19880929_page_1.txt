acknowledgement of the Rai that
Swapo is the leader of the liberation
movement, let alone being the only
liberation movement. Kavari, in fact
should show cause why Nanso must
not acknowledge Swapo leadershipof
the national liberationstruggle. I feel
strongly thattoaccept the unavoidable
reality that Swapo leads the nation
liberation struggle does not make us
politically affiliated to Swapo.

What is surprising for Kavari's let-
ter and all others who seem to be con-
cerned with Nanso’s secalled pro-
Swapo stand, isthat noneofthem men-
tioned the current crisis in education.
An impression is given that Nanso’s
recognition that Swapo leads the
liberation struggle is more evil and
criminal than the current crisis in
education. Meetings after meetings
are called and proposed not to address
the crisis, but Nanso. Nanso now has
become the crisis. Kavari talks of
another national student movement
as a possibility, simply because Nan-
so has recognized Swapo leadership of
our struggle. IfNanso had recognized
or named the HNP as a progressive
party, than one would understand and
conceptualize the cry of Kavari et al.
If Nanso had failed to address the cur-
rent crisis properly and Kavari et al
talk of another student movement
which shall address the crisis in a bet-
ter way, one would understand their
cry. But thecry issimply because Nan-
so says Swapo leadsour nation at war
with SA colonizers. Swapo, the pro-
greasive movement, the organizer of
victories of our people in their heroic
anti-colonial and anti- i Imperiale
