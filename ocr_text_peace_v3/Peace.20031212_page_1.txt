Why Should Human Rights
Man Be Called To Order?

THIS ts my reply to the Namibia
Today article uted ‘It is high nme
for Phil ya Nangoloh to be called to
order’ published in the Swapo
mouthpiece on November 21 2003.

Asapeace loving Namibian I read
with concem the above mentioned
article which shows the intolerance
of some of the Swapo people towards
human nghts and democracy in this
country. In an attempt to silence
Namibia's only vibrant and fearless
human nghts organisation and its
executive director, Swapo through
its mouth piece Namibia Today urged
subordinates that “It is high time for
Phil ya Nangoloh to be called to
order”,

I ask myself why the NSHR
director should be “called to order’?
The article made some allegations
about what Swapo claims to be
“fabncated stories”.

Please allow me space in your
newspaper to respond to the said
claim directed at Phil ya Nangoloh,
in particular, and the NSHR, in
general. I want to correct these
misleading and misdirected
allegations.

Swapo claims that Ya Nangoloh
“fabricated” stones with the purpose
of “discrediting Namibian security
forces” because the NSHR made
several reports that Namibian and
Angolan security forces have killed
innocent Angotans during the recent
conflictin the Kavango and Caprivi.
Everybody knows by bow thateither
through eyewitness reports or
through the reports by Amnesty
International, Human Rights Watch
and the NSHR that there were several
killings committed by the Namibian
secunty forces both in Namibia and
Angola. Even recently a member of
the Namibian security forces, a
certain SFF commander, tesufied in
the High Court that he and other
Namibian security force members
were given orders and have carned
out such orders to shoot and kill
people during the night in the
Kavango region.

As forthe Swapo question or claim

thatthe government should not worry
about ineffective groups like Tagoma
referring to the recent morder of
Tagoma leader Shevanyenga, I
would like to say this to Swapo: the
late Mr Shevanyenga was a

Namibian citizen like everyone else”

and the government is held
responsible for the security of every
Namibian. Therefore I see no point
for several government and Swapo
leaders to issue death threats to an
ineffective group which finally ted
to Shevanyenga’s death.

Thirdly, Swapo accused Mr Phil
ya Nangoloh to have “fabricated a
story of people who were perceived
to be eliminated, apparently also by
goverment.”

Itis afact that Mr Phil ya Nangoloh
and other NSHR human rights
defenders received death threats on
several occasions. This makes it
difficult for them to carry out their
acuvities which is what Swapo
wants. However the NSHR and Mr
ya Nangoloh must be praised and
not condemned and threatened for
their courage to have shed light on
such incredible and cowardly
attempts to undermine the defence
of human nghts and democracy in
this country. By publicising the
names of persons likely to be
assassinated the NSHR most
probably has saved the lives of more
Namibians who might be facing
assassinations. In so doing, the
NSHR also strongly defended the
principles of democracy and good
govemance and respect for the rule
of law in this country as enshrined tn
our Namibian constitution.

Fourthly, Swapo goes on with its
accusations against Ya Nangoloh by
denying that there was or there is no
“cross border” trade with Angola on
the part of the NDF. However, there
is strong evidence that the NDF made
use of State vehicles and NDF
soldiers to carry out such border
trade in building materials apparently
for the enrichment of certain
individuals. The NDF themselves
have never denied the NSHR report.

Fifthly, Swapo further claims that
if Ya Nangoloh “do(es) not want to
live under Swapo government, he
should just pack and go instead of
indulging himself in dangerous
subversive activities.” This
misleading statement must be
suongly rejected and condemned
with the contempt it deserves. Ya
Nangoloh and the NSHR have both
the right and duty to accurately
informed the Namibian and other
peace loving peoples about human
rights violations by whoever and
whenever such violations occur.

Human nghts and democracy are
foreign to Swapo and Namibia Today
and this is why the NSHR activities
are called “dangerous subversive
activities.”

It is also not understandable how
the NSHR and Ya Nangoloh are
indulging in any “dangerous
subversive activines” by defending
human rights principles and
combating corruption which is so
tampant in this country. To me such
activities are duties of each andevery
tesponsible Namibian citizen.

Furthermore, it is imperative to
note that the dangerous threats
Swapo has made urging Ya
Nangoloh to “just (to) pack and go”
are actear indication that the list that
the NSHR recently produced after
polling the opinion of several citizens
is far away from being misleading.
Other people can now see for
themselves from the Swapo
intimidationas published in Namibia
Today. task myself what will happen
to Mr ya Nangoloh if he does not
“pack and go” as suggested by
Swapo, especially after being
accused of “indulging himself in
dangerous subversive activities.”
Will he not be assassinated like
Shevanyenga?

Swapo must know that they and
their government will be held fully
responsible for anything happening
to Ya Nangoloh and other human
tights defenders in this country
