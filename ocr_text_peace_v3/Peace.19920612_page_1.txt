NOt yet solved,

t is Surprising that th

e

Government and specially
the Office Of the Prime Min-
ister is Prepared to Mislead
Public opinion by appointing
someone tO investigate the
acquisition of land by only
three people and especially
in the communal!

areas. That
office being responsible for
the imp ion of the Land ”
Conference, recommenda-

tions could have started there
to solve the national issue of
land.

Itis also surprising that the
Government, whenever it talks
of the legal or rightful acqui-
sition of land, only concen-
trates on communal land. Let
it be stated here categorically
Clearly that we the Namibian
people, and especially those
of us who laboriously fought
to return back our stolen land,
did so for the whole of Na-
mibia including the socalled
commercial farmland.

Lasting peace and stability

in this country could only come
if equitable distribution of land
is done now and not later. The
question of senior officials
acquiring land only demon-
Strates to us that people are
hungry for land. If senior of-
ficials have the means of us-
ing their official positions to
acquire the land, the mass of
our people who on numerous
occasions have demonstrated
publicly to have the land ques-
tion settled, may one day take
up arms to revoke the present
status quo as far as land own-
ership is concerned.

It is hurtful to note that the
land price is artificially made
to be exhorbitantly high to
benefit those who forcefully
took control of our people
and ownership of our land.
Once cannot accept that in
Windhoek it is practically im-
possible to buy a piece of
land to build a dwelling.

So, Mr Prime Minister, we
the silent majority, who fought
for the liberation of this coun-
try and suffered imprisonment
and detention for the libera-
tion of this country, who dem-
onstrated fearlessly in the
streets of Windhoek, Katu-
tura, mines, schools, did so to
ensure that Namibia is free.
We who voted the Swapo gov-
emment to power want our
land NOW. We expect you
urgently to implement the Land
Conference recommenda-
tions. The more delays to the
solution of this probicm, the
‘more our patic:. - will run
out. Land is a fundamental
right of every citizen of our
country. Land is the source of
life, the key to development

If this Suggestion is not
workable, may I ask the Gov-
¢mment to put the question to
the electorate during regional
elections which are due be-

fore the end of the year. I
think that the verdict of the

majority of people is neces-
sary. My verdict is that we
are being held hostage by an
unpatriotic few who think of
Namibia in terms of their own
benefit alone and who through
their access are misleading
public opinion. Commercial
farms are not touched now,
butare they able torespond to
the urgent need for food in
this country? I am pretty sure
and convinced that if access —
to land was easy, the effect of
the present natural calamity
would not be the same. Be-
Cause more people could have
engaged in food production.

I want to point out that the
Namibian food market is rela-
tively stable because the pres-
sure is reduced by the com-
munal land which provided
71 per cent of the livelihood
of the inhabitants of those
areas. Now the population of
both animals and people is
increasing, and the ecology
has taken its toll because of
the way in which the land has
been over-utilised. The logi-
cal solution is therefore the
urgent need to solve this
question. We want our land
back.

On Earth Summit

THE Earth Summit presently
being held in Brazil once again
highlights the precarious po-
sition Planet Earth finds itself
in because of the short-sighted,
profit-oriented exploitation of
its natural resources.

It also shows that if man
has learned anything from
history, it is the fact that man
never seems to learn from
history. ,

Take, for instance, the av-
erage citizen's matter-of-fact

‘attitude towards the environ-
ment, especially in our still
developing, relatively non-
industrialised country.

We need just look at the
severe problems being expe-
rienced by the socalled de-
veloped, First World and in-
