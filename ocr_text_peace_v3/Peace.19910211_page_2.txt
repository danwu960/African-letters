To cancinde my letter I would
like to call upon the local people
to assist the police in getting
_ sid of these people and having
these elements arrestod. [hope
that the police will take the
matter one step further and
outlaw the carrying of knives
and pangas.

We are children of the new
Republic of Namibia and we
want to live in peace. I do not
agree that Namibians should
tolerate these cnmes and al- â€”
low them to continue.
