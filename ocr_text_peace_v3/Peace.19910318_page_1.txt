woll as the ballot box, adopted
the policy of national recon-
ciliation, the policy of forgive-
ness and focus on the future.

Firat of all, let us examine
the significance of March 21.
The date is and will remain an
iliumdnating day in the Na-
mibian calendar. Liluminating
in the sense thal it is the day on
which the yoke of colonialism,
which was imposed on us, was
buried for ever.

It was the day on which
dignitaries from all over the
world joined the brave sons
and daughters of this country
to witness the burial of coloni-
alism by replacing the South
African flag with that of the
now Republic of Namibia.

Tt was a wonderful and
moving occasion, which pres-
ont and future generations will
nevor forget. It was a day on
which the nationalist fighters
stood band in hand and said
“look, our sacrifices have not
been in vain’.

As tho freedom fighters were

is humane and suitable for
Nantibians.

The most striking aspect of
the policy is that it promotes
tho valuss of end buman
dignity. It intends to unite the
Namibian people irrespective
of colour, race, nationality or
origin. This policy deserves
our respect.

Many have complained about
the negative aspects of national
reconciliation but little has been
beard about its menits.

The success of the policy
depends on the performances
of those implementing it. The
menits of this policy are more
than its dements. This policy
if, in my view, meant to pro-
vide a breathing space for those
harbounng illusions about the
past colonial system to adjust
themselves to a new era of
national independence, pence,
stability and the humane ap-
proach.

As we rejoiced on March 21
last year, we were equally
worried about what we had
inherited from the then noton-
ous colonial regime in terms
of debt, unemployment and
poktical instability (the latter
with regard to tendencies of
tribalism and racial discnmi-
nation based on colour).

The problem is, how are we
going to pay the socalled debt
without economic prosperity,
and how are we going to com-
unsmpioy ment situation with-
out ecanomic growth?

The government's effortsto
combet the unemployment
situation will be meaningless
unless accompanied by the will
and voluntary participation of
the ‘haves’ of our society.

should be offering guidance to
our people to create for them
opportunities to rebuild their
self-respect, restore their faith
and rediscover for themselves
their human dignity. Regional
radio stations should be util-
ised for the benefit of people in
those regions.

One of the Government's
main priorities is education. It
is the finest foundation of all.
for the nation-building proc-
ess. It is also the comerstone
upon which to rest our surest
hopes to build our young Re-
public.

As we approach the first
anniversary of independence,
we need to be devoted to the
cause of national building
through the process of national
reconciliation.

Failure to implement this
positively will effect the con-
cept of democracy in this coun-
try.

We cannot achieve any of
these objectives unless we are
hardworking, disciplined, law-
abiding and implement the
policy of national reconcili-
alion in a positive light.
