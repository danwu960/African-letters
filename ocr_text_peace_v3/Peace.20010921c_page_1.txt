US Must Look
In The Mirror

THE 11th September 2001 was not just a bad day for
America, but a very sad day for me, personally, and my
entire family. This is the day, we lost our dearest and
beloved father, Tate Joel Shikongo. May his soul rest in
peace and enter heaven. At any rate, this is what this very
terrible and fateful day also means to me.

Now, just what makes anybody decide to commit such
horrific deeds of terrorism against the mighty nation on
earth today or against anyone else for that matter? Was it
a revenge for the evil deeds that America has been doing all
over the world to others or was it just some act of mindless
terrorism by some mad dogs out of nowhere?. Either way,
what was clear ts that the acts of terronsm committed in
America recently are certainly so hard to justify ... let alone
to be condoned by any human being with a mind, soul and
heart!. I surely would like to join the rest of the sympathetic
world and give my sincere condolences to all the American
families and individuals who lost their innocent loved
ones. Any nght thinking human would do exactly that,
except those who feel! that America has been living in the
fool's paradise for far too long. By all means, my hearts
goes out to the victims of those human tragedies in America,
just like it does for the many poor victims of oppression,
diseases, wars, poverty and hunger, ete everywhere in
various parts of the world. [ would therefore like to urge
here for America to look into the mirror, and see the real
image of themselves. Terrorism is the same. whether
committed by an individual or a government. Amongst
others, the real problems which America will now have to
solve is their often racist. arrogant, hypocritical practices
and double standards in the world. This may just turn to be:
the real victors and durable solution to the problem of
terrorism, now and tn the future. As a Muslim, I know that
my God does not condone terrorism. My salaams to all.
