Unite!

- DEAREST fellow couktrymen and
women, lurge you to unite and support
your movement Swapo to the fullest ex.
tent, no matter what the enemy ofour
people may think.

This moment isa threshold to the im-
plementation of Resolution 435 and
subsequently to the independence of
ourcountry. Namibiang, like any other
nation, must show their unity, to fight
hard inorder toeliminate colonialism °
and slavery as well as racial
discrimination and exploitation of |
man by man in our land. Our people
should be on the look-out for the
enemy s tactics of disuniting us.

We must stand firm on our way to
freedom without wavering, We do not’
have Lolet ourselves be stoopes where
the enemy of our people can use us to
fight against our own people and
freedom of our country.

The racist government has so many

plans and tricks for destabilisation,
We must be prepared to defend our
would be sovereignty and hard-won
independence. We must not allow
banditry to take place in our free
Namibia.
We must be prepared to develop our |
country in order to have enough food
for our people, enough shelters and
good communication systems
throughout the land. Peace must
prevail in our land after our
independence. :

We have to live together agchildran
of this beloved land Namibia. We must
also be prepared for hard moments
ahead of us. The racists in Pretoria
have never been honest and cannotbe |
trusted. We have seen the horrors they
are causing inourcountry until today.

Many lives have been lost, many peo-
ple have gone miasing without trace,
many families have become childless. |
and many children have become orf
phans. All such horrific and barbaric |
aot are committed by the raciats and! |
thet followere. | ah , , TI _
_. Beloved nation, wehave *IAngulahed .
