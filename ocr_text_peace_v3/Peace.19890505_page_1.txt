Untag understrength

THIS letter was drafted for Untag
attention by the residents of northern
Namibia. The following are points in
the letter:

1. Restrict all SA forces to base.
With Plan fighters beyond the 16th
parallel, Untag must sec to it that
SWATF and SADF are disbanded. If
Pian combatants are beyond the 16th
peralle], Untag must confine the SA
. faeces to Oshivelo and Grootfuntein
* Nan ines in 435. We may not be

ate gin presuming Uniag is tunder-
and there is an obious inreai

rs fair’ elections.
Hoan 435 asecict dea!

public. On April 30, security farses
came out of bases and intimidated —
peoplé, tearing down NUNW plac- .
ards. Letting the SADF from con-
finement doesn’t give peace a chance.

3. Residents are compelled to put
on DTA T-shirts and give DTA signs.
What about democracy?

4. Residents here are threatened if
they demonstrate the black power
salute.

5. We need more Untag offices in
the north to facilitate contact by ci-
vilians. In this way contact with Untag
could be made easier.

6. Untag lacks contact with resi-
dents - they should talk freely to
them and this would solve immedi-
ate problems.

We call upon Untag to improve
and fulfill its responsible task.
