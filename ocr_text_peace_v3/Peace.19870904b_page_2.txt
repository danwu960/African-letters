We have been praying for the SADF
to leave your country because we are
deeply concerned about the ive
role it is playing there. Some of us have
visited Namibia and seen for
ourselves, others of us have had the op-
portunity of meeting some of you and
hearing about your own experiences.

We have been praying and fasting
because we have wanted to show our
care, concern and support for you,
Namibians, in aconcrete and practical

way.
(J To the South African Government,
whose forces are illegally occupying
your country, we say, hear the cry of the
majority of Namibians. Show your
sincerity in wanting anend tothe war
and establishing a truly just peace by
lifting the curfew, withdrawing the oc-
cupying SADF forces and moving
towards a swift implementation of
Resolution 435. We all know that this
ig what will end this wasteful and un-
necessary war and that this isthe solu-
tion which most Namibians want, so
why are we waiting?
Clo you, Namibians, we say, we share
your longings and frustrations and
commit ourselves to continue to pray,
fast and work until the SADF is
withdrawn from your country and un-
til your inalienable right to be free has
been achieved.
