Now I don't know Mr Shipenga,
what your Cabinet has been discuss.
ing with the South African Govem-
ment in camera. But I do know that
| ‘Newniblans; home and: abroad, dagws
been calling for political and eco-
nomic pressure on South Africa, and
I know that such pressure has come
about.

Finally I am surprised that Mr
Shipanga only now sees it fittoinvite
me to join hands with other Namibi-
ans to build the sort of country of
which we can all be proud, while he
knows that it was my commitment

and his cabinet were campaigning
for ‘alternative’ models for Namibia's
independence because ‘UNSC Reso-
luuon 435 was dead’ I was among
those who were calling for the imme-

his cabinet's marnage to South Af-

| were al) along fast asleep and must
wake up to the tune of his ‘New
Year's Message’ of reconciliation,
when we were the aaron were
| telling him mar
sgn with South Africa will one day
| be over, and what would he do then?
