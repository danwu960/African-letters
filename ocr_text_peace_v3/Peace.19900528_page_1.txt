Fighting chiefs

THE time has come for Chief Moral-
iswami to see that the border dispute
case has not been solved by the
Supreme Court and that his ancestors
were not the first to settled in the
Eastern Caprivi. The Chief and his
elements should then be prepared for
Ins claim that he is the (Munitenge)
supreme ruler, custodian and para-
mount chief in the East Caprivi at the
expense of his counterpart.

Cinef Moraliswam has been the
plaintiff in the border/chieftamsiup
case for a long tirfe. It is time, now
that we are independent, to ask the
Honourable President, as a neutral
person, to help resolve the issue once
and for all so that both Chiefs respect
one another and restore peace in the
region. The Chief ahould face reality
now. He knows very well how ex-
pensive the court case has been for
both Masubia and Mafwe factions.
People were forced to contnbute
because of his actions.

He obviously thought that by tak-
ing the case to court he would be the
victor. It is for these reasons I want
him to sit down and account for what
he has done. He has sown hatred and
mistrust instead of uniting the people,
as the role of chief should be. I see the
Chief now gives a clenched fist sa-
lute; as far as | witnessed, he was a
UDF and later an NPF supporter in
the pacâ€™.

It is my wish that the President
should solve this problem to help the
two chiefs to know their tribal juris-
dictions. Caprivi will not be the first
region to be demarcated, but chiefs
in other regiona know their jurisdic-
tion and that is why there are no
senseless claims in other areas.

lonce again appegl to the govern-
ment of the day to come up here and
show each chief where he begins and
ends so that the one cannot claim
] supremacy over the other.
