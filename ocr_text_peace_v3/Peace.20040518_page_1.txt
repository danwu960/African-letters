The Struggle Has Served Namibia Well

TAM not new to the liberation strug-
gles of southem Afnca. In fact | was
born into the struggle waged by the
ANC in South Africa and married
into the struggle waged by Swapo
in Namibia. Now, when you are born
into something, itis part of you and
you are part of it, not by choice but
by bith The liberation struggle was
about people, land and wealth. (twas
about the inalienable nght of peopte to
freedom {twas about reclasming our
dignity as Afncans and indigenous
inhatatanis of the soil of Africa. In
fact the lnberanon struggle has been
about claiming the right to deciding
our ow ndesuny as nauons of Africa or
atthe least, having some inputinsuch
decisions Wwasulsaabouteverydas
“bread and butter” issues

(am sure that anthropological cx.
pers will testify to the fact that one
of the outstanding charactenstes of
populauons is that (hey are not stag
nant, butare constantly undergoing
Jynamee tainsformaton ‘The armas
lo casure that this mobility 1s upward
and fomvard instead of regressing,

For the masses the struggle has
been aboul basic human nights The
fight fo protection, the nght to food,
clothing, shelter, education, health
care und the nghtto free association
Whilst cach one has to take respon:
Mibility tor there own aghons: and
Ile. its the collective that has to
cstsure that the correct glmosphere
and environmental qulicu as well as
systems and structures are ia place
(o guaruntee o positive contnbution
by the individual for the betterment
of the society. Internationally ut ts
the Breton Woods Institutions that
countries adhere to and support for
the sake of having workable and
ofgunined sovretics

This immediately calls on the
individual who has the right to be
ambitious to exercise transparency
and accountabiltty. Hence the adop-
ion of a system called democracy.
The adoption of democracy docs
nol imply the adoption of a westem
systent, but is rather the implementa.
hon of the best workable sy stem that

contains an assemblance of faimess
and exudes a sense of dational pride
anda sense df worthiness and dignity
to the society it serves. Democracy
can be customised to suit that par-
ucular nation’s needs.

The world has become a global
village mainly due to the strides man
has made in information technology
as well as the affordability and speed
with which people are able to travel
from conunent to continent. In my
own travels [ tind that people have
a keen interest in socio-economic
and politica] matters on the African
continent and the world at large

What | have observed is that the
populace of Afnca is no longer pre-
parcd to accept any sense of embar-
rassment because of corrupt political
leaders in their respecuis¢ countries
‘This gocs for the peopte’s intolerance
towards despotic tendencies from
whatever quarter.

Thave mentioned the masses and
their interest when at came to the
liberation struggies. Howes critmust
not be forgotten that it has been the
saline masses that produced a robust
and solid res oluvonary intelligentsia
able to interpret and pracuice real
poliucs

Hasingcome from the masses docs
hot necessarily essume that those
with power will not be corrupted by
hunger for such power Nevertheless,
these appetites are kept in check
by the fact that there are others to
compete with as well as the voice
of the masses to contend with. The
resultis that the best person wall then
win. Owing lo the ever. changing
dynamucs of socicty, leadership will
also change because at the end of the
day, leadership is about the people,
the collective, the nation and not the
individual

The aim and art of both politics
and religions to unify people and to
ensure the sustainability of that unity
through service delivery. In any capi-
talist society, “service delivery” isa
popular buzzword because the society
isenticed, tempted and encouraged to
consume. Financial interactions are

mainly characterised by producers
and consumers and members of the
population interchanging these roles.
The danger here is that the majority of
the population will become consum-
ers instead of contributors.

Many umes thisleads toa situation
where a minority of the populauon
become very wealthy with the ach
gerung richer and the poor getting
poorer. The electronic media play
@ mgorous role in encouraging this
state of affairs even through their
soap operas whose emphasis 1s on
wealth and immoral living

The bottom line 1s that in order for
aAnauon toachvely engage in matters
that affect it’s existence, the elected
potiucal and church leaders together
with the bureaucrats and technocrats
in both the public and pnvate sector
huve to present the nauon with in-
novative cutting edge programs that
include all of society

The fast time ] counted, there were
forty-1wo counties holding elections
during the vear of 2004 globally. This
means that there ts a changing of the
guard taking pluce in many countries
including Nauti. Fnendandenemy
have toadmut that Namibia has main-
tained a powerful sense of political,
civil and economic stubihty, which
together have contnbuted to the peace
and tranquillity of the country. The
Swapa leadership has proven their
tenacity and political matunty over
and over again when tssues, which
could have got oul of hand, were
handled with great craftiness and
smartness as well, That is why ut
should not come asa surpnse to those
who understand the agenda of Swapo
that the president has announced his
decision to bring his tenure as head
of statc to a respectable, dignified
closure as would be expected of any
gicat African leader of our ime. We
can also rest assured that no longer
being the president of the Republic
does not automatically mean that il
is the end of our president's polit
cal career.

In fact for me it is the continua-
tion of a powerful career, which is

now to take another form. That of
African Statesman, especially with
the interesting evolution of the Af-
ncan Union and programs such as
Nepad. It is statesmen such as our
president and ex-president Nelson
Mandela together with others of their
generavon and calibre that make us.
the younger generauon proud of be-
ing African.

Tremain convinced that Swapolike
other mass based poliucal parues in
the sub-region definitely has the in-
terests of the nation and the country
at heart [ watch with amazement
how some of the media miss the
whole thing when they concentrate
on personaliues anddemonusing them
when the main issues go beyond the
individual. The thing 1s that no mat-
ter how much the prophets of doom
scream and shout, the people are not
prepared to trust anyone wath their
lives and their children’s future, but
rather those men and wonten who
unselfishly led the liberation struggle
Let us face st

Service delis ery for the masses and
the pres wously disadvantaged under a
Swapo government has taken place
and even reshaped the landscape of
the country It is u great achicve-
ment for a commututy that never
had cunning water conung out of
taps to have this supplied to it. This
uxcludes eloctncity and roads us well
as telephone lines.

The above have been the main
aspects of life that the community
has cned out for The minority are
concemed with tax breaks, micro and
Macro economic strategies and gov-
emment spending which 1s fine, but
many umes the mouve behind these
concerns is usually self-centred. Our
nation is in the process of i
a future generation where wealth will
no longer be the right of only one
colour, but our children, black and
white will be entitled to achieve and
possess wealth as Namubians.

Itis an achievement when people
who could never have expected
anything in the past can own a piece
of ground to build a house. It is an

achievement when all our children
are free to attend any school and play
anywhere and do not have to be sub-
jocted tocarly morning raidsio which
their parents are snatched from them
Ttis an achievement when the enure
nation does not have to be ynpped
by a demonic spsnt of fear because
of draconian apartheid laws

As a son of the liberauon strug-
gle and a citizen of Namibia as my
adopted country and as a minister of
the gospe! of Jesus Chast and anes
UN diplomat, | would like to inform
the segment of our society which has
never experienced the real brunt of
apartheid to desist from demonising
leaders who contnbuted immensely
to the freedom of the people of Na
mibka. | sense an uncomfortable ani
ety among some of my indigenous
Caucasian brethren. I would suggest
that we all embrace dus counts as
our collecuve responsibility and re-
spect the goverment of the day and
make a better contribution Ht aught
be wiser for all of us to direct our
cnergies andatilines towards shanng
land and skills to achieve ccononuc
independence and sabisfaction as we
compete with other states formarkets
Itmught be safer lo realise that should
one sink then we all sink

Tet us thank Atmightys God for
a country tit is the enes of inany
countnes in the world and let us
comnmut to IMprove Of Our previous
achievements. Allow me tu express
great respect and admiration for
President Sam Nuyoma and those
around him for sdently teaching us
a lesson and having the foresight to
unite the nation by having taken the
step he has taken. Mr President, no
one can deny that you arc a great son
of Africa, a founding father of this
nation with Its diversity. Your great
legacy of hard work and high mon
standards will always live on and
manifest itself in the generations to
come. Thank you sir for allowing a
new day to dawn.
