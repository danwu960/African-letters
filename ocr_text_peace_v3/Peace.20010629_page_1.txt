deny this fact, Aturnutala!

Our permancat interest
is a tly free Angola aod
you know well that An-
gola is not free. The Dos
Santos regime is the most
corrupt dictatorship in Af-
nica and Dos Santos of Sao
Tome is the richest man
on the conunent. He is
cracking down on the free
press and other civil soci-
cy groups even more than
the Swapo Government is
cracking down on The
Namibian newspaper.

towards Unita. Direct your
hatred to the MPLA and
Namibian soldsers who are
maiming and killing eth:

Bushmen under the dis-
guise of “suspected Unita

Have they ever capured
a single Unita soldier to
show him to you? There
needs to be positive proof
of Unita’s involvement 19
