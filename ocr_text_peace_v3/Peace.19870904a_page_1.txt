No to elections

MANY TIMES I have heard over the
radioand read in newspapersthat the
South African Government is calling
for ethnic elections in Namibia.

I want to use this opportunity tocall
on the people of Namibia not to accept

ethnic elections. We want the im-

ementation of UN Resolution 436
â€œind the chance for the people of
Namibia to choose their own leaders.
We wantequality for all andanend to
discrimination.

What will happen ifethnic elections
are held in Namibia? There wil! be no
change, apartheid will continue,
Koevoet will continue with their
activities.

People of Namibia: let use unite more
than ever to fight against the system
imposed by Pretoria and to stand
behind one leader, Sam Nujoma, to
fight for equality, peace and justice for
the people of Namibia.

Isalute those who have already said
no to ethnic elections.
