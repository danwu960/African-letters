Swapo and
Angola
IT is rather shameful and |

wing 1s simply silent on
the unfortunate situation

| unfolding in Angola.

The recent eruption of
war in Angola warrant
us, the youth of Swapo
i particular, to make 11
unequivocally clear
where we stand on the
cnsis. The Unita ban-
dats were clearly defeated
in the elections - the UN
cerufied that and any
chspute should be settled
peacefully.

Frankly, our silence
may be tantamount to a

_ | betrayal of our bond of

fmendship that ' Bxust
‘ between Swapo and the

MPLA. Angola, of all
countnies, deserves our
unreserved .

I do not need to re-

- the other hand, Jam fully |

a word of solidarity and
condemn the bandits for
resuming the civil war.

At least a token of
humanitarian aid (how-

of Angola would be a

. BOOd start. Swapo youth

should launch nation-
wide campaigns to

mobilise support for the |

Angolan people in what-
ever is feasible. I am
Pretty sure our youth will
respond posiuvely. One

' aware that the majonty

of Namibuans aren't well
off either, but neither do
I underestimate their
resolve whenever called
upon to act - after all,
we are the land of the
brave, aren't we?

So | am calling upon |

the Swapo youth to speak
out loud and clear. Per-
sonally, ] would like to
register my solidanty
with the people of An-
gola during this most

difficul period. My only
wish is for lasting peace
to prevail there.
