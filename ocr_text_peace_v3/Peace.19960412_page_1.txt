TAM SHOCKED by Mr Groth's book Namibia:
The Wall Of Silence. Why not ‘Namibia: The
Country Of Secrets as both sides did the same.

Mr Groth, you should have written two books
Opening up all sides of the Story.

Swapo was a party that fought for our freedom,
therefore it was supposed to be suspicious of
anyone coming to join Swapo.

You don't expect Swapo could have taken any-

Mr Groth, if people are saying that some of those
who tortured people in Angola and Zambia are in
parliament, what about those who were against
Swapo? Some of them commanded squads to kill
Swapo members, but they are also in the Partia-
ment, police, defence force and some even hold the
higher ranks.

Talking about spies.

Mr Groth, I, who am writing this letter, was a
Swapo member during the struggle. I was beaten
many times and shot at with rubber bullets. They
really did send spies to Swapo camps.

I was approached by a certain cop at that time a
lieutenant but now holding a higher rank. He
wanted me to betray my fellow members by pre-
tending that I also wanted to go into exile. I was to
fetch him the day the people would leave so that
they could capture them. I refused. I could not do
that to my fellow Namibians.

He came to me again and this time he wanted me
to goto Angola, gain information, escape and come
back to tell them the plans, where the camps were
and many things I can’t mention. I still refused and
after that 1 was watched like hell.

Mr Groth, there is a fot you don’t know. Start
writing a book about the other side, things mustn't
be seen from one side only. Only both sides can
clean the wounds.

Swapo won the war and they didn’t take revenge.

they asked for peace, fogiveness and to
Teconcile. Is that too much to ask?

When people came back from exile they were
full of bitterness and hatred and wanted revenge,
but the President told them not to go ahead but to
forgive even though we remember and will never
forget.

If you want toknow about those who disappeared
and were tortured by Swapo, why should the DTA
not do the same? Let both sides do the same. It is
ota one-sided story.
