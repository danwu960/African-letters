Reply to Shipanga
MR ANDREAS Shipanga said in
a recent letter published in two
Windhoek newspapers that ‘Many
of our members and thousands of
other Namibians were not so for-
tunate. They were imprisoned, tor-
tured, raped and murdered ...’

Was this what you were doing
when you were one of the Swapo
leaders? I ask this because you say
you ‘know’.

It is also not the first ime you
accuse Mr Sam Nujoma, our Presi-
dent, of being ‘stupid’. [ don’t need
to tell you just how dynamic our
President is; he who led our peo-
ple, Swapo, through very difficult
times, and because of Mr Nujoma,
South Africa has failed in her ob-
jective to destroy Swapo.

Victorian language was never 2

uisite for charismatic leader-
ship. President Nujoma speaks
good English, and | remember a
white woman once said: ‘I, 0 far,
have failed to understand Mr
Shipanga’s English’.

Do you remember that you

threatened to withdraw from the

circus by September 1986 if
i AG 8 were not by then?

won't do that.
Leave Professor Lombard in
peace. He is a person who wants

objectivity and he will not be im-

pressed or intimidated by you.
