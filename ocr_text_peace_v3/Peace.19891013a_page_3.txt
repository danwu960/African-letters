The former struggle should not
as a conflict between black
and white but should terminate as a
conflict between the South African
colonial power and the Namibian
population. Not only el the biggest
political rally in Namibia, on Sunday
September 24, has Nujoma offered
reconciliation and cooperation. This
gesture was not motivated byu the |
wish to gain the votes of the whites.
Swapo does not depend on these votes
to win the election. It is rather based
on the willingness to learn from the
experiences of other African coun-
tries and is guided by the aim of a
peaceful and stable future for all

Namibians.

Appeal: I would like to appeal to
all, to recognise and accept the reali-
ties, and not to be deceived by ide-
ologists, politicians and a one-sided
press. See, hear and think for your-
self.

Accept the offer of reconciliation
andi cooperation instead of sneering,
spreading false rumours or laughing
about distasteful pamphiets. Grab the

ty at this point of history
and regard the coming independence
oa , rather than a threat.
