in most of Swapo’s publications
which are circulated as widely as possi-
ble, this organisation lists the numbers
of landmines they have laid. Often the
‘names of people who were murdered
also appear on these documents. Swapo
also acknowledges abductions of young
men and women. These atrocities are
Jauded as acts in the struggle for in-
dependence. Mr Katjavivi says people
are not abducted, but only taken to be
re-educated.

Neither you, Dr Shejavali, nor any
of your colleagues have ever condemn-
ed these senseless atrocities against in-
nocent civilians. On numerous occa-
sions, internally and abroad, you have
publicly called for support for Swapo
in its struggle against the ‘oppressors’.
Not once have you called on Swapo to
cease the atrocities against civilians.
