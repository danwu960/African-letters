"Age comamies 90 bed?

IN THEE hast edition of The Namib-
ion and some other newspaper, | hed
the eppertanity to reed what some
sembers of the SADF were saying
about commmnina. Before I say
anything about the subject, I would
like to mfonm readers that | was born
and brought up im the communist
state of Yugosiavia. I might add that
while living and working im ary home
town I had always refused offers to
become a member of the Communist
Party.

According © what these army
members say, which can also be taken
as the general opmion of Namibian
whites, particularly farmers, com-
munism means dictatorship which
includes the alling pf poliucal oppo-

Many of them regard anyone who
opposes the apartheid system and
white mmonty rule as a communist
or even, terrorist. I belseve that these
that this socio-political system in
which we live, or have been forced to
live, 1s one of the best. One thing is
sure, it is some kind of capitalism.

It is as unwise to say: Chnstianity
is better than Islam or the other way
around, as it is to say or think that
capitalism is better than communism
Or vice versa.

Of course any socio-polincal struc-
ture benefits someone profitably. If
we compare communismos and capt-
talismos, let's say according to the
number of private-owned cars and
television seis, we will have the
impression that capitalism is much
better. But if you look at other things
m the capitalist society, hike the number
of suicides, drug addicts, kidnap-
pings and terrorist attacks, then we
have another picture. It seems to me
that people in the capitalist world are
not so free and happy. Life under
communism is safer and better.

We must also not fail to give atten-
tion to job security in communist
states where itis very difficult to fire
workers from their jobs. Here in
Namibia the firing of workers is

‘normal procedure".

If we wantto learn the facts we will
notice that communism by itself is
not some kind of poverty-maker. In
many communist-ruled states, living
standards are much higher than in
non-communist states; take for ox-
ample Latin America or the Phillipi-
1 nes, None of them are ruled by the

Comunmuniats
