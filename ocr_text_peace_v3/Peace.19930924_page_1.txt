| Celebrated their ‘cul-
} tiiral’ festival and resi-

dents were powerless to
defend themselves from
the onslaught.

In case one is accused
of exaggeration, I am
talking about four nights
(I fell asleep by 3am) of
disco music blasting
over the entire area -
every syllable of every
song trespassed closed
windows, locks doors,
earplugs - right into the
furthest crevice of one’s
bedroom.

The police were also
powerless to restore
peace because Vice-
Chancellor Peter
Katjavivi and Dean
Kandetu “had given their
permission”. Acomment
from the Minister of
Home Affairs would be
appreciated on this point.
Since when can two in-
dividuals muzzle the

police force from de- |
fending peace-abiding |

citizens?

A strange state of af-_

fairs - Vice Chancellor -

Katjavivi and Dean
Kandetu held control
over the police and the
Windhoek West taxpay-
crs, rate-payers, rent-
payers - those mere
mortals who have to
work for a living.

The two University
chiefs were indifferent
to residents’ direct ap-
peals as well as police
wamings after the first
night's assault. This
could be due to several
reasons, all worrying:

- perhaps they had in
fact lost control;

- Of perhaps they were
trying to ingratiate them-
selves with the students?
Very cheap!

- perhaps they consid-
ered it an important les-
son in democracy for the
future leaders of our
country. Those privi-
leged students are more
entitled to rights than
workers
