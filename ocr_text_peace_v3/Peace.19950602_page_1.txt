Defence Of Abacha Visit

THE President hay recently been at-
tacked in the media tor visiting Nigena
and above all for mv :ting General Sani
Abacha to visit Namibia. Those who
criticived this action have every nght to
exercise their freedom of speech. How-
ever, J find the reasons they advanced
in condemning the President's acuons
to be invalid, profoundly immature. ir-
rational and highly misleading. Also
these critics manifest a dangerous len-
dency of intolerance which is not healthy
for the survival of democracy.
Whenever there is a conflict or dis-
pute it is better to attempt to solve it
through peaceful means, starting with
dialogue. President Nujoma is very
much conversant with this principle.

Therefore, when Dr Buthelezi ob- agg

structed peace in South Africa he talked
to him: in the same vein he extended an
invitation t@ Dr Savimbi of Unita to
come to Windhoek to discuss the prob-
lems and peace in Angola. Also, when
South Africa was a panah state, pro-
gressive people all over the world, m-
cluding victims of its policies, remained
ready to talk and listen. It is therefore
wrong to condemn statesmen who ini-
tiate dialogue with General Abacha.
The fact that President Nuyoma is
willing to associate with him should
not be seen as demonstrauve of support
for the latterâ€™s regime: it should instead
be seen as an attempt to help Nigeria

return to democracy.

tsolating General Abacha when he is
willing to assoc tale with democrats will
only encourage him to contunue violal-
ing peace in Nigena and strengthen his

undemocranc methods of govesmment.
