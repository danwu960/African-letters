Victory Choir
needs promotion

I AM wniting to you after spending almost a month in
your very beautiful country (over Christmas 2003 and
into January 2004).

I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to visit
both the south and north of the country as well as some
of the coast with an excellent guide and a small group
of other foreigners from various countries.

I also spent almost a week in Windhoek at the end
of my stay and visited the Katutura Victory Women's
Movement. I got to know the very capable director,
Katrina Ganises, and her colleagues there and the
choir sang for a friend from New Zealand and myself
— we were both very impressed by their performance.

Incidentally, I also met a reporter from your paper
the second time I was there.

I sing ina church choir here in the north of Italy and
also with a small jazz band which generally makes ten
or twelve public appearances a year.

I sincerely feel that the Victory Choir should have
more opportunity to appear in public, both to let
people see how good they are and also as a way of
getting funds for their very important project.

I would suggest that they could sing at the airport to
welcome international delegates arriving for meet-
ings and congresses and at the larger hotels, like the
Kalahari Sands, the Safari Court and the Country
Club Resort and Casino, where I feel sure that foreign
visitors would enjoy their performance.

I know the choir would have transport problems to
get to the hotels, but I imagine that the hotels them-
selves would be able to arrange that aspect of things.

I would be most grateful if your newspaper could
print all or part of my letter and am also sending
copies of it to the above-named hotels for their
attention.

The Victory Women’s Movement deserves and
needs your help!

Before I close, let me also say that travel extensively
as part of my job and really enjoyed my stay in Namibia
- itnow holds a very special place in my heart.

I send you all my very best wishes for happiness,
good health, success and peace.
