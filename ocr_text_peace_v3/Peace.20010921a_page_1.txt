PLEASE allow me space
in your highly esteemed
Paper to comment on
Amenca’s New War. lam
very concerned about re-
ports that people are flee-
ing Afghanistan in the
wake of fears of a possi-
ble US attacks on alleged
terrorist bases.

Following the attacks
on Amenican interests in
New York and Washing-
ton it is not surprising
that the US propaganda
machinery made this the
worst-ever Story reported
so far in America. The US
media did not give acom-
plete and in depth cover-
age when innocents peo-
ple where massacred by
US forces in Vietnam or
in the Gulf War to name
but a few.

It is sad that innocent
people died in this attacks
but I just wonder whether
the lives of Americans are

THE NAMIBIAN

America Must Not Wage War

worth more than the lives
of Afghans, Sudanese, Vi-
etnamese and other states
where people have been
attacked by US forces.
American presidents
should have remembered
that “what goes around
comes around”. Is it not
always innocent people
who die when “big” men
are fighting? Just like
those who are going to die
when Afghanistan is at-
tacked? The world should
wake up to the realities at
hand. The US itself was
labelled a terrorist state in
the past and it is exactly
what they are.
Remember what hap-
pened with Patrice
Lumumba and the war of
the Bay of Pigs in Cuba?

They are using Pakistan
and the sympathy of other
countries to launch a full-
scale attack on a sover-
eign country.

I just wonder where the
sympathy of the world
was when innocent peo-
ple died in missile attacks
by US forces on the order
of former US President
Bill Clinton in Sudan af-
ter the bombing of the US
embassy in Kenya and
elsewhere? It shows the
hypocrisy of these coun-
tnes that are supporting
the United States in this
new war. One should also
look at the hypocnsy of
the Pakistan ruler who
came to power by over-
throwing the former gov-
ernment and its leader. He

is buying face with the
USA and its allies at the
expense of his own peo-
ple.

This new war is a rev-
elation that the United
States is an aggressive
state and retaliation will
not stop but intensify ter-
rorist activities against the
US.

How can there be peace
in the world if only a few
countries are living in
complete wealth at the
expense of the rest of the
world? I'm really ques-
tioning this new war idea.
What makes US intelli-
gence sure that these at-
tacks have been master-
minded by Saudi exile,
Osama Bin Laden? There
are many suspects in this

case, just to name a few
countries that showed an
anti US stance such as
Iraq, Yemen, Libya, Cuba,
Palestine and many oth-
ers.

The US has failed for
more than four years to
arrest Bin Laden, a clear
sign of the weakness of
the US security, intelli-
gence and defence organs
against international ter-
rorism. I really think that
they are abusing the sym-
pathy of the world to at-
tack a sovereign state if
Bin Laden is not handed
over.

The attacks on the Pen-
tagon and the twin tow-
ers of the World Trade
Center is a clear indica-
tion that the attacks were

aimed at what is repre-
sented by these buildings
rather than the innocent
victims. Itisa known fact
that the Pentagon repre-
sents the military power
of the US and that the
World Trade Center rep-
resents globalization,
capitalism, colonialism
and other negative vices
which is still repressing

the rest of the world.

Is a US attack on Af-
ghanistan really justifiable
if one considers the facts
above? [ think they want
tomove the attention from
the failure of their intelli-
gence organs to detect the
planned attacks in time. |
also think that they want
to make use of this chance
to kill even more people,
as they have done in the
past.

Living In Hell

TAM sure that every peace-loving citizen of this planet
was hornified by the senseless loss of life when America
was attacked, but believe me some others were celebrat-
ing this massacre, just to remind us that we are living in

hell on this planet.

To every American who has lost a father, mother,
sister, brother, son, daughter and friend there is only one
being who can console vou in times like this and that is
