Namibia. Any collaboration with the
racist regime, means you have
automatically declared yourself an
amy of the freedom loving Nami-

ian people and the peaceloving peo-
ple of the world.

Whatever you are trying to do for
the Namibian people is nullified by
the fact that you are ‘giving’ them
what is theirs after robbing them.

Mr Angula was speaking in the in-
teresta of the oppressed and suffering
people of Namibia.
