WHEN Savimbi's death was
announced, many
propbets climbed on the
bandwagon of “We'll have
.”To some of these
there were two bulls
in the kraal, and one ar the
other bed to make way for
the best. That is the way they
see things. But we should
bear in mind that there are
many states in Africa run by
a singe ruler, and yet they
are no better off than An-
gola. However, there isaume
to hope, and a time for opu-
mism. In a previous article,
and later an open letter to
Madiba, I appealed to inter-
national leaders who were
directly involved in Angola
during the colonial era, to
come to her aid. | also em-

so suddenly was quite unex-
pected, as though some evil
spirit was tracking him
throughout the length and
breadth of the country, guid-
ing him carefully and pa-
ently until he met those who
claimed his life. He’s gone
now, and forever. Penrod!
In retrospect, we take ume
to think of all kinds of stones
we read about him. How evil
and cruel] the man was, how
uresponsible; how his das-
tardly deeds of infamy sowed
havoc in hus own motherland,
and eventually led hum to be

Punny, we’ ve neverheard the
international Court tn the
Hague declare that the must
be tied for his crimes. At this
moment they have old
Slobodan behind bars. But
perhaps the ame will come
for his accusers to line up and
cast the first stone. Whatever
it was that Julrus Caesar did
out there with the woman
called Cleopatra, upon his
amival home in Rome, he paid
with his life. And Caesar was
anhonourable man ofhis day
There are those of Savimbt's
countrymen who have been
very vehement in their patn-
otic outbursts: “‘] love not
Savimbi the less, but Angola
more,” we beard. Perhaps, but
which pan of Angola are they
talking about here, the dia-

mond area, or the oil well
area? At this stage, as the
people of that country are
scattered all over the SADC
region, with very litle if any
possessions of theirown, we
take anybody who says he/
