‘Not the solution .

[prt
IT IS unacceptabi ito deliberately
bypass UN Security. Council
Resolution 435 whic ap the only
solution to the Namibian question.
The present interim government
disregards the UN settlement plan
for the Namibia issue, while it also
cannot bring about peace and
stability in Namibia. - : |
How can a true Namibian, who
has the interests of his country at
_ heart, support that government?
It is also unable to end the
_ balkanisation of Namibia, and the
interim government should be te-
_ jected. They should know
| assumption of power is illegal and
the progressive, pro-UIN Resolution
parties in particular, must continue
to expose the pro-Pretoria and im-
perialistic nature of | the interim
government, |
The ban on meetings: and rallies
_will not ease the situation, and it
. must de noted that only a few peo-
_ ple are in favour of the status quo
in this country. But the majority
must rule,,
> A fair and just election will
possibly end the unjust system of
apartheid and all draconian laws i in
} this country. |
} The socalled ministers are delay-
| ing independence because they have
j always played the. interests of
Pretoria off against their’ ‘OWN peo-
ple. The voict of the oppressed is
again reminding them that recon-
ciliation means Justi ce and
freedom. .
