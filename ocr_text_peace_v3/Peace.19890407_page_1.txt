Upset with Untag

I WISH to express my heartfelt
sadness al the irresponsible attitude
of Untag in Namibia from April 1.

[ am disappointed in Untag in
genera) and Mr Martti Ahtisaari, for
their unwillingness to perform their
duties as expected of them by the
Namibian people.

On Apnil 1, a peaceful march of
the Namibian workers under leader-
ship of NUNW was forcefully stopped
by colonial, heavily armed police in
the absence of Untag police who are
Supposed to accompany them. Thanks
to the disciplined actions of the
workers themselves, injuries and
bloodshed was avoided since the
colonial police were under strict
command to act against the 15 000-
strong crowd if they proceeded with
the march to hand over a petition
protesting privatisation of public
property to Mr Louis Pienaar, the
Administrator General.

After the well-attended Swapo rally
in Windhock on April 1, Swapo
riembers and supporters on their
way back north were shot at by two
white vigilantes. Seven people were
injured, two scnously. When a local
pastor went to report the incident to
Untag personnel in Tsumeb, he found
the officer in an inebriated.

The most buming issue, which
forced me to write this lettcr, was
when civilians when to Untag per-
sonnel in Oshakati to report heavy
fighting between Plan and the colo-
nial army, the two Malaysian mem-
bers of Untag took no notice and
went on rcading thcir novels. Some
of them were seen sipping wine with
South African soldiers at Ondangue
amd Oshakat. ] am wondering whethe
Uhese international peacemakers are
really serious about what they are
doing in Namibia. I am also sur-

contnbute soldiers when they want

| would also like to express myself
on the decision by Mr Ahtisaari to
allow the notorious 101 and 202
battalions to be reactivated in order
to fight Swapo, Mr Ahtisaari's mis-
sion was lo make peace but instead
he agreed to the demands of the co-
lonial govermor to allow the same
groups to go ahead and continues
doing what thoy havo dono for yoars,

Mr Ahtisaari, through his actions,
has lost the respect and pularity he
has enjoyed since 1978.

I call upon all progressive forces
inside Namibia w take united and
decisive action. We should always
remember the inspi words of
Swapo President, 8am ujome, who
auld "‘we the Nemiblans, are our
own liberators"’.
