Judge Hoff’s judgement disappoints

I] WOULD like to express my disappointment and
dismay through your newspaper regarding the
ruling for the Caprivi 13 accused by Judge Elton
Hoff.

Judge Hoff’s ruling for the 13 demonstrated to
the nation that the judiciary in Namibia is in the
wrong hands.

If we look at this issue critically, the judgement
was well orchestrated to be interpreted as if the
Government did not follow whatever rules or
procedures should be followed. But, in fact, Judge
Hoff formulated it (thé ruling) in such a way as to
allow the state to re-arrest them, creating room for
‘reactionary institutions’ (sic.) to cry foul about
the judiciary and painting Namibia as a country
which does not respect its own laws. This is not the
case at all.

The charges remain: the accused allegedly
planned and declared war against the Government
of the Republic of Namibia. Where we supposed to
sit back with our tails between our legs, while our
hard-earned peace is being disrupted and our
country being destabilised?

We all know the results of war - the disruption of
the well-earned peace, destruction of property.
loss of life, hunger, poverty and other setbacks.
Those who wanted to secede the Caprivi had
misguided objectives, were driven by selfishness
and hunger for political power and they — if found
guilty - should rot in jail.

The security forces should be commended for
swift action and a job well done. They have sent a

clear message to would-be terrorists that Namibia
isa well-protected democratic country and whoever
tampers with her sovereignty will feel the wrath of
the Namibian law.

Whose interest does the so-called court ruling
serve?

What made the 13 accused leave the country
under the cover of night? Who invited them to the
neighbouring countries were they were hiding? If
they had a genuine cause, why didn’t they hand
themselves over to the authorities of the countries
in which they were hiding?

But were Judge Hoff and his court blind and deaf
the day when he ruled that return of the 13 to
Namibia violated some international laws and
procedures guiding extradition.

Which procedures did the 13 follow when they
allegedly carried out their attack at Kama Multlo?
Why should we follow some procedures by bringing
misguided elements to be tried back home? Who ts
he (Judge Hotf) to determine the fate and the
interest of the Namibian nation?
