IN SUMMARY: It has not ben the ob-
jective of this brief article to driticise
what was said, or not said/ at the
Lusaka conference. Indeegf the con-
ference wasa significanjand welcome
political developmgat. Rather, our at-
tempt has begpsfferely to restate and
keep alivethe debate as to the road to
socialist Agvelopment for Namibia,
after independence. In view of the
debate raging in ‘sqcialist countries’
atthe moment, tothe e&tent that some
leading personalities argreported to
have questioned isdom of the
revolutions that toe place there at all,
as well as wejebming extreme right
wing politigdi leaders toexpound their
philosophies to their people,
it is importantveverrmore so for usin
Namibia, toopen upas many areasas
possible for debate - now.

South Africa and America introdaced

ing their best to switch the burden
talks to the opposite parties - will
Angola accept all the SA. and
American demands? If yee, what will
happen to Angola next?

We rejected the connection of Cubans
to the independence of Namibia and
wore and are still demanding the
withdrawal of the S.A. troops and its il
legal regime from Namibia, but not
one of either parties (South Africa or
America) is willing to listen to us as
they are in favour of war. South Africa
staysin Walvis Bay even after UNSCR
435 is implemented - what then?

We are intimidated by the SA.
regime with its apartheid laws and
military atrocities. It is preaching its
“goodness” to win the hearts and
minds of the people, but we suffered for
a long time under its colonial regime.
It is still continuing to minimize our
political rights - how will we continue
with talks?

Cubans were willing to help Angola
from the intimidation we experiencing
here and their presence in Angola is
legal. As long as the intimidation to
the Namibian people continues
Angola cannot be saved.

Those who are threatened by the
presence of Cubans in Angola are the
“Terreblanche group’ of the South
African regime, who want to exploit
the Angolan people and its allies. Once
the Cubans withdraw from Angola the
‘Terreblanche speech” in the past few
days will be manifested practically.

The Namibian people welcome the
Cubans, because they are comrades -
they don't kill, but save. We have ex-
perienced SA (not Cuban) atrocities;
and the Angolans too.
