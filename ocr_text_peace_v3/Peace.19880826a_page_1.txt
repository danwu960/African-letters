Reply to Kavari

ALLOW me tocomment on the letter
which appeared in The Namibian of
August 05, under the heading
“Pallacious’ written by VT Kavari.

I've been present al the Nanso con-
gresses since 1986 (second congress) up
to this year with the fourth congress.
where I’ve experienced a spirit of
brotherhood,

What I have observed is that after @
speaker has delivered a speech, oppor-
tunity was given to the house for
discussion, questions, correction, ad-
dition, clarification, comment, etc.

I believe this was done so that with
the departure of the congress no com:
rades could go to their respective
places with unsolved problems asitap-
pears to be In your case.

I'm just wondering whether you
never got the opportunity to air your
views and to go personally tothe NEC
Members, instead of doing it in the
newspapers and to create a tasteless
spirit among the students, which is
totally unnecessary.

If you were at the congress you will
remember that comrade Shihwamen!
was the last person to clarify on this
issue. |

He explained that people have to
make the difference between a pro-
gressive party and a liberation move-
ment. He went on saying that pro-
gressive parties are mostly concerned
with ethnic issues, while Swapo which
isa liberation movement, is aimed at
liberating all the peace loving people
in Namibia irrespective of their col-
ours, ethnic groups, etc.

This is a fact that we, in Namibia
have to accept that Swapo is the only,
only armed movement that is fighting
(unless, as Shihwameni said, "there is
another armed movement that is
hiding underground”)

- What comrade Steve saidat thecon-
on this issue was positive and I,
with the majority accepted it, although

- youdiffered as you said, in your letter.

Of course, minorities always differ!
That we have learned from history ib
Lastly, let the truth not hurt us,
please! |
