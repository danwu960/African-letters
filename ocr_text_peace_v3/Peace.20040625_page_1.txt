Poor Planning In Boeing Purchase

KINDLY allow me space in your
Newspaper loair my views on what
I see as an issue which should
concern all true patriots as well
as taxpayers in this country, the
purchase of the Boeing 747 Combi
by Air Namibia.

Firstlet me thank the government
of the Republic for its commitment
todevclopment.I cannot enumerate
all its achievements because there
are somany. Let me also say that]
have no doubt that the government
wishes to see things moving in this
country, after all that is what we
fought for. To return to the Jumbo

Jet, | think, keeping quict on this
issue would be tantamounttosaying
{could not care less about the future
of this country. Asacitizen, I feel it
is my duty not to allow what I see
as imprudent financial decisions to
continue to be made.

When one looks at the financial
quagmire into which the Combi
has dragged Air Namibia, they
would not think that it was the same
plane that brought the ‘feel- good
factor’ in some quarters upon tls
purchase. | trusted that those who
make decisions onour behalf would
be careful not to pour public money

down the drain by engaging in what
seems to bea not-well-thought
through purchase.

The reasons advanced for the
lack of viability of the Bocing
makes one wonder whether proper
procedures that purchases of that
magnitude require, had been fol-
lowed prior to the purchase. In my
book, there seems to be indications
of lack of sound economic think-
ing in the purchase of the Combi.
Consequently, to put my mind at
peace regarding the purchase of
the Bocing, Air Namibia should
answer the following questions:

Was any investigation conducted
to determine the viability of the
Boeing? If it was, why are we now
being told that the Combt's carry-
ing Capacity and its maintenance
make ita financial burden? Did not
the study address these and other
pertinent issues?

Comrades, let us admit that the
purchase of the Bocing 747 was a
squandering of government money,
money which could have been put
to use somewhere else. In my
view, this kind of practice will in
the long run undermine the govern-
ment and therefore to deter this

kind of spending of public funds
in future, somebody must be made
accountable for this shameful
blunder.

If you want me to believe other-
Wisc, convince me that the decision
to purchase the plane in question
was based on scientific invest pa-
tions the results of which were
positive. And therefore the current
financial crisis is nota result of poor
planning. The questionis: Have we
learnt any lessons?
