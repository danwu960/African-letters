Guilt On His Mind After Death

YES, this is how we have
all learned of the death
Of Moses Garoeb. Now
that he is dead, Moses
Garoeb will be a differ-
ent man. Different from
the Moses Garoeb who
lived during the libera-
tion movement. On the
occasion of his death,
may I convey, through
this newspaper, my con-
dolences to’ those who
loved and appreciated
him as father and hus-
band.

May the “unusual” re-
action to his death make
them an exception. At
this ume of sorrow I do
not want to add insult to
injury of Mr Garoeb’s
family.

Moses Garoceb dies as
a man with guilt on his

mind. He has totally
failed to openly admit
that he was, together with
others, responsible for
murdering many inno-
cent sons and daughters
of the country. Although
he died a troubled death,
he is in his motherland.
He was buried as a
“hero” in disguise.

I am bitter. Moses

Garocb has left his po-
litical successors to in-
herit blood stained

“files”.

In that sense his death
is untimely. They are left
with unanswered ques-
tions about the Lubango
genocide.

I have always urged
Swapo leaders to clear
this dark part of our re-
cent history, but with no
success.

Will we have to wait
until the last butcher dies
and been afforded a he-
ro's funeral before we
find answers to this ques-
tion?

Today many families
are crying for their loved
ones who were murdered
by the notorious Swapo
security men in Lubango
of which Moses Garoeb

made apart. He has never
been and will never bea...

enough, I have

to tell the cle

cleared I will die with a
troubled heart and Na-
mibia will never know
genuine peace.

I know just as every-
One does, that anyone,
good or bad, can be

era are now removed
from the face of Na-
mibia. Street names have
been changed because
friends of the apartheid
“heroes” are no longer
in power.

For those who glorify
Moses Garoeb as a hero
of the Namibian people,
just remember thathe ui-
rectly participated in the
brutal killings and exter-
mination of my Brothiéis :
