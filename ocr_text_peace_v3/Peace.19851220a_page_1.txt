Disunity is the cause of balkanis~<:on

FOR HOW much longer can we live
under South African colonialism
which isa ‘crime against humanity?’
Namibia is the inheritance of
Namib and we are Namibians
and not South Africans.
The South African Government
has failed to fulfill its promises to
build Namibia and to give it back to
the legitimatecitizens of the country.
They took Namibia and then devis-
edan ideology among the Namibian
community: let us divide them and

rule them because they are slow
- thinkers.

I want to remind Namibians that

a ltt ets oo -

we are one, and that we should not
allow ourselves to be divided by a
foreign force.

The ideology of divide and rule is
created to bring about misunderstan-
dings, disunity, hostility and all kinds
of evil among the black people.

Namibians let us stand up for
peace, justice and equal rights. Do
not fear, because fear is betrayal. Our
Struggleisa just struggle. The work-
ing men of all progressive and peace-
loving countries are behind us. As
long as we remain disunited, so we
will remain balkanised, both
regionally and territorially.

If we turn our backs on the pro-
blems facing our society, who is go-
ing to blot out these evil and diabolic
things perpetrated against
Namibians?

It isself evident that South Africa
considers that the black people of
Namibia should be used and not
respected. The Multi-Party Con-
ference was created to delay the in-
dependence of our country, Today
this group claims to stand for ‘good-
will and reconciliation’ and claim
they have committed themselves to
human rights.

The question is, what happened

—_

on June 17 this year? Was it not the
MPC who sent Koevoet in against
their own people? The MPC leaders
are not fighting for the independence
of this country. They are fighting for
their own benefit.

Today our people are losing their
lives in the north. Where are the
MPC? Our people are being detain-
ed without trial. Where is Mr
Kozonguizi, the Minister of Justice?

The MPC are not serious about
the independence of Namibia. They
also know they donot have the man-
date of the Namibian people. They
