- Western capitalists who re assisting
‘the egal regime of Pretoria in our
country. :

There are numerous multinational
companies operating illegally in
Namibia today, viz. CDM, Rio Tinto,
TCL, Soekor and others. These com-
panies are mining Namibian minerals
contrary to UN Decree Number].

Millions of tons of diamonds, copper,
and metric tons of uranium are ex-
ported illegally to N ato-member
countries.

The Namibian people, under the
leadership of Swapo, the sole and
authentic representative, have tried on
many occasions to oust Pretoria from
Namibia but because jthe racist
government has the ba-+ing of the
capitalist West, this has not succeeded.

When one travels Namibia, one sees
evidence of how our resources are ex:
ploited and exhausted. The freeway
down to the south is always full of
heavy duty trucks loaded with cattle
being taken to South African markets,
while many of our children are looking
for food in rubbish bins and are sleep-
ing with empty stomachs. There are
more bottle stores than educational
facilities.

And while our natural resources and
agricultural potential ia being ex-
ploited, our independence is made con-
ditional to the withdrawal of Cuban
troops from the People’s Republic of
Angola. The Cubans have been in
Angola for almost eleven years now,
and are only seen as a threat by the
cowboy regime in Washington.

Ifapartheid Pretoria had not invad-
ed Angola in 1975, there would have
been no Cubana there today. Pretoria,
is responsible for what happened in
that country just before independence.
We are no so naive to be misled into
believing te Cubans are a threat;
ed

amibia was never colonised or invad-

byCubans Weonly know apartheid

South Africa,
South Ag a should quit Namibia
now and leav ube peace odes
_ own future, through internationally.
