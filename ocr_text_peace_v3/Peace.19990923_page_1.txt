With the background
knowledge about our ac

ture of Namibian kruay
students of today the
Deputy Minister was di
rect aad to the point We
would Lhe Mr Jona
Johannes to know that
Nartaa is a democranc
country. There are funds
mentalnghts and freedoms
enshneed in the constitu
tion and there 1s nothing
wrong for her to give a
Vistom of how a yust toc!
ety shomid funcpon.
What she sad was in
tine wih our theme. and
the Nagai busn consb tution
We would like to tell Mr
Johamnes thai the two quo-
(ations bee referred to are in
nO way comparable. for
the ssemple fact 1 the

Deputy Minister was ad
dressing tbe students on
the theme she 4 as asked to
speak on

We think iti a laudable
idea lo promote and coor
dinate the activities of
Cathohe students and the
youth as @ 4 hoke on social
Jushce and cultavate mean.
ingful snteracuon on all
levels In cur purnuu of a
culture of peace, we
Namibrans joined the glo-
hal community in signing
manifesto 2000 af which
the President of Nasmubia
wasprsem What the Hon
Miniter talked about was
& vissom for a just society
and we foel she hes that
Obligaoon as a hugh rank:
mg goremment official to
address student on themes
of tuch importance.

Even the Presdent made

Statements similar tos those
ofthe Deputy Minister

For example he sad
Peace in the world must
Sat wath indiduals Ut
tmust stam in the hearts and
minds ofeachnun woman
andchid is aduty and
tesponubility of each and
every one Of us io putinto
Practiwe the values, ott
tudes and forms of hehas
hour whic hina pare and pro-
mote the Collure of peace
$0 that humaniond could
lve an peace without the
threat of war and vio
dence”

Given this underntand
ing Wis hard for us to
comprehend how an iad
vidual Like Mr Johannes
whatever his intention
mught be, can call on the
Hon Deputy Minister 1
resign

Should President
