On the Boer War

WITH THE recent propaganda
against Swapoon the part ofthe DTA
mouthpiece, I would like to bring the
following to the attention of the
public.

The facts about Swapo in that
mouthpiece are manipulated and
propagandistic in nature. The whites
who sit behind this propaganda are
exploiting the lack of knowledge of
our people. I

In 1899 to 1902 the Afrikaners
fought the Boer war. Let me mention
some factors in connection with this:

* the guerrilla war of 1899 to 1902 was
the first significant one in Africa;
*it was learned fromthem that guns
could be taken upasa last resortand
when allother possibilities had been
exhausted;

* 1-year old children fought in that
war;

* with their Calvanistic background,

they saw their war as rightful before
God;

* the Afrikaners did not separate
politics and religion;

* they were convinced they fought for
their country and freedom;

bd the homes and farms of the
Afrikaners were burned down bythe
enemy British;

* women and children were placed in
concentration camps, where more
than 22.000 children under the age of

16 are alleged to have died;

* Hensoppers were regarded as
traitors while bittereindes fought to
the finish;

* the traitors were sometimes
sentenced to death by firing squad;

* the Afrikaners were distrustful of
the English and their peace
initiatives;

* children of traitors could not be
baptised in the Dutch Reformed
Church.

Taking this into account, why the
fuss about the fact that Swapo is
holding their traitors in detention, in
much better conditions than those of
the Afrikaners during the Boer War?

Already, deep in the National Par-
ty hierarchy, inthe NP church, there
is a change against apartheid. They
are now beginning to realise the ir-
reparable damage done to the black
by means of apartheid.

View the propaganda of the
Republican Party with caution. Itis
the Broederbond's psychological
war against Swapo. Swapo will not
be broken. Shipanga and Muyongo
tried it and failed. Do you think
Maria Boois and Beukes will get it
right?
