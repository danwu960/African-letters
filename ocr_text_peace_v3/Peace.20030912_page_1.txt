Facing Up To Destructive Forces in Namibia

NAMIBIA is one of the few
countries in Africa that contin-
ues to enjoy peace, stability and
unily as a nation after the cruel
joke of colontalism was disman-
tled for more than a decade
Colonialism made us a united
nation, because all of us faced
one external enemy at that dark
time in our history. Unfortu-
nately, as independent people
we no longer umite as one. An
apparent external enemy no
longer threatens us. In the ab-
sence of this enemy it 1s much
easier for some people to mis-
take their fellow ciuzens as pos-
sible foes So these foes should
be confronted through tribal af-
filrauons.

Destrucave forces such as tnb-
alism, favouriosm and nepousm
have now taken root in our na-
tion. Tribalism will bring disre-

pute to the present anity of our

nation. The waity of
tioned by people

themselves increasingly pushed
aside to the edges or periphery
of society. So they have to sur-

vive on the crumbs which fall
from the table.

At the present momentif your
find yourself in this country you
are fortunate tn terms of political
stabrhty. Itis not good for many
counties in Africa. Disorder,
chaos and fratncidal war are con-
unuing to disruptorcut short the
life of many common fellow Af-
ncans in those countries.

Ordinary people or laymen do
not choose such an intolerable
muserable situation. The pohtu-
cal elite did indeed bring Cain's
curse on their counmes. All the

problems are not of their own
making Some problems might
be duc to external dependence
and external influence.
In Namibia we are not com-
pletely free from all types of
lems. We have problems of

nomic and political system and
makes it bleed internally that
can be difficult to see with a
naive eye.

Thirdly. crime and other so-
cialevils are making the lives of
innocent and law-abiding citi-
zens difficult. Despite all these
problems we are still relatuvely
at peace with one another politi-
cally. But this peace can be short-
lived as long as these problems
remain withus. Itcan be likened
to a bird flying in the air, anyone
can killit by shooung or stoning

if one wants to.
But let us not be like a nation
of ignoramuses about our reja-

tive stability, peace and unity.
As Africans on the African con-
tinent we are not completely
shielded neither are we immune

to see Namibia plunge [into per- :
or economic in-

petual political
stability. We want

be viewed nationally and inter-
nationally positively as acountry
that promotes peace and unity,
which is sustainable amongst its
citizens. Additionally, Namibia
as a country should stnve to use
its diversity to enrich itself not to
kill itself. So the immortal words
uttered by one of the famous,
revered non-violent civil nghts
leaders. Dr Martin Luther King
yor that says. “Thave adream...”
sull speaks and its valid to our
CUITCNE situation as a nation strug-
gling with trbalism and other
evils. As anauon we should have
a dream that solely concerns his
orher character, abthty and com-
petence and which will determine
the future of our country’s citl-
zens livelihood. If we take char-
acter, competence and ability td
be precedent over tribal affilia.
