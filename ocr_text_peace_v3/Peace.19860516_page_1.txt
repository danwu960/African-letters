ALLOW ME to react to the rude
speech of the socalled Minister of
Health in the interim government,
Mr Moses Katjiuongua. (The

Namibian, May 4 1986).

The said Mr Katjiuongua was in
a state of desperation when mak-
ing this ridiculous speech, and thus
apparently did not realise his use of
uncivilised Language in describing
his political opponents.

He called our leaders ‘power
drunkards, political jokers and op-
portunists’. Now (0 examine the
issue seriously, who is an oppor-

Cunist and who is not? Why did you
run away from Swanu to join the
MPC government? Is that not op-
portunistic and power-hungry?

You try to fool the people by tell-
ing them you don’t want a civil war
in Namibia. Is it not a civil war
which is being fought in the north?

Mr Katjiuongua, try and address
yourself to the real facts and pull
yourself out of that pool of
stupidity, |

it you try to be objective and
realistic, you would not be worried
about the positive actions of pro-

Empty promises about a ‘new deal’

gressive partics aimed at the speedy
implementation of Resolution 435.

People know what you stand for
and your empty promises of a ‘new
deal’ will not make the people
suscepuble to this cheap propagan-
da. You and your colleagues are
ruled by apartheid and confusion
and this makes you more reckless
than ever.

If you consider yourself a na-
uionalist, why do you not push for
the implementation of Resolution
435 and your Bill of Rights?

[f you slay as you are, a short-

will not impress peopl

sighted neo-colonialist, then | can
assure you that there will be no
tranquility in Namibia as long as
we are being ruled by a foreign
power through the MPC. The
MPC government should be
abolished and replaced by a
democratically-elected government.

You cannot claim peace in a state
of continuous institutionalised
State violence and unemployment.
People need freedom, peace and

securily and not torture and deten-

tion without tril. Give the people
what they want by granting them

their right to practice “self. : Be
determination. _ So . _ one
Why should you be afraid of a
Resolution 435 if you ‘claim’ the | moe
support of the people? ws

Lastly, I would suggest you use
more civilised language when mak-
ing public statements, because you
are causing ill-feeling among the
