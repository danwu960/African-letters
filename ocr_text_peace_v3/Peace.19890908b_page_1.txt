Thanks to Untag

AS a Namibian who loves peace, ]
would like to thank Untag for its
work thatit has done and will still do.
T also want to thank the UN Secretary
General, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar
for his work and wish him well.

My message to the UN members
of the Transitional Assistance Group
is: continue what you are doing, don't
tire, you will be rewarded.
