“PHEL ya Nangoloh alleged that
a formals activist of his socal-
fed Nationa! Society for Hu-
man Rights visited Lubango
and was informed by a com-
maander at a Swapo house there
that ‘Swapo detainees’ would
only be released and repatri-
ated in 1998 if Swapo gets a
two-thirds majority wn othe

detainees are being re-educated
and that that ‘certain high offi-
_ cials in the Namibian Ministry
of Education pay visits there to
address the detainces'.

Phil ya Nangoloh even wen!
90 far to calegorate and com-
pile a list of people who alleg-
odly went missing while in
Swapo detention end number-
ing them eccording to their
tribes. He claims that among
tue said number there were 36
Ceprivians, 38 Ndongas, 35
Kovemyamas, 43 Kwambis and
96 Windhoskers.

by others, the frequency of the
orchestrated aftacks against
Swapo has again increased of
late.

In the light of these accusa-
tions, Swapo of Namibia
demands that Phil ya Nangoloh
produces full names, addresses
and specific areas of ongin of
the following: the female ac
livist who went to Lubango:
the commander who was met
by this activist in Lubango; the

officials from the Ministry of
Education who met the ‘de- |

tainees' in Angola; the alleged
detainees referred to above and
the names of the rest of the 625
detainees he «claimed went
missing in Swapo detention as
per the updated list.

Swapo has undertaken to
make a preliminary report about
the sacrifices made dunng the
war in terms of human lives
and hopes that the report will
be available before the end of

this year. However, the proc- »

ess of searching for missing
persons will, like in any other
war, continue for a long time
to come.

Swapo of Namibia pro-
pounded the policy of national
reconciliation aimed at bring-
ing peace, political stability
and unity among our people
which are pre-requisites for

economic development.

However, clements in this
country who are faithful to their
sponsors continue to distort the
painful episode in the dark page
of the colonial history in this
country, hus impainng this
policy. Swapo will not allow
this to continue.

In conclusion we wish to
state that should Phil ya Nan-
goloh fail to produce the infor-
mation as outlined above,
Swapo will be forced to take
the appropnate action.
