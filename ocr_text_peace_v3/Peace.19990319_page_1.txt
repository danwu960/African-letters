TO us young people of
this country during the
years of the !9608 and
19708, Swapo symbolised
the mage of cquality. jus-
uuce and freedom for all
the people of Namibia.
The prevailing sttuauion
then was one of oppres-
sion, denial of justice and
human rights for the
greater magority of the
black and coloured popu-
lation of our land. ‘There
were laws instituted such
as yob reser ations, Bantu
education and numerous
pass laws restricting the
movement and abode of
qiuzens merely on the col-
our of their skins
One could not get cer-
tain categorics of Jobs, no
matter how qualified you
were. One could not pur-
chase of own property or
land no matter how much
money you had. One
could not attend any
school or academic inst-
tution, This circum-
stances were degrading,
humiliating and restrict-
ing the human spirit of
our people for generation
upon generauon. The pot

was boiling and an explo-

s10n Wak Inevitable. That
is why the message of
Swapo found much sup-
port and sympathy among
a broad strala or our op-
pressed population.
Swapo's vision of a ust
pohiucal, social and eco-
homuc society for all eth-
nic groups in the land was
hailed country wide.

Many of us, parucu-
larly in the Baster and
coloured communities,
were ostracised because
we openly proclaimed our
adherence to the Swapo
Siston for Namibia. In
many instances we were
denied basic privileges
that were normal in our
socieues. But we perse-
vered because we were
convinced that Swapo’s
vision was the nght one
for Namibia.

For it was a vision
where people of all col-
ours, tribes and origins
would take hands aod
build a new Namibta, free
of sunfe. oppression and
dental of basic nghts. It
was a vision where we
thought the play-field

would be levelled in terms

ments in all government
institutions would be done
fairly. It was a vision
where no one tnbe would
again try to dominate over
the others. It was also a
vision where all
Namibians live in peace
and tranquillity, where no
Namibian would again be
a political refugee or flee
their homeland because of
political intimidation and
fear,

It was because of this
common vision that the
support for Swapo was so
broad among the Nami-
bian people. It was be-
cause of this common vi-
ston that the support for
Swapo was unwavering.
For many it was a vision
for which they were pre-
pared to sacrifice their
friends, famity and posses-
sions.

For many others it was
a vision for which they
were prepared to lay
down their lives. For
many today, however, the

shining vision of Swapo
has become a great disap-

Ppotetncnt. Por many thin
vision lies shattered.

Why?

In simple terms. Swapo
has for the past cight years
that it has been in politcal
power in Namibia, done
nothing but emulate all the
evils of the past apartheid
regimes. It has instituted
one of the most corrupt
sysicms of self cnnichment
by political leaders and
their close friends and
relauves. It had created an
clite system whereby a
small clique derives all the
benefits at the detriment of
the deprived. poverty
stncken population. It has
instituted tbalism of the
most naked kind in the
civil service and
parastatals.

The Swapo-govern-
ment has squandered our
resources by the mishan-
dling of the national
budget as was again re-
cently pointed out by the
Auditor General. It is ap-
parent that the Swapo
government is just not in-
terested in maintaining

discipline.

‘Thin te the renult of
competent and unquali-
ficd people being ap-
pointed to responsible
positions merely on the
basis of their ethnic and
tnbal ongin. The govern-
ment is using legal means
to achieve illegal ends. It
is thus clear that the ac-
tions of the present
Swapo leadership have
deviated drastically from
the expectations of the
masses of our people.

That brings us to the
crucial questions at this
juncture in our history
WHAT IS TO BE
DONE?

That is the question that
was asked by Lenin when
Mother Russia laid shat-
tered because ot
maladministration, cor-
ruption, ethnic conflicts
and Tsar dictatorship. This
question also has to be an-
swered by Naiibians at
this point in history
