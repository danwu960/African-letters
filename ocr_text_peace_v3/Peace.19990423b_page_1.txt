Noise In Our Ears

LET me express my views in connection with the
newly-formed party (Congress of Democrats).

[ am not against the party's formation,but I an
against some of its members who are making noise in
our cars. Why can’t they resign and RO to the
they think is right for them without making any noise
Or accusing their previous political parties of failin
to do as they promised. That is immature and y
childish if not abnormal behaviour.

It is their right, I know that, but I don't think they
must use bad language against the Swapo party, a
that brought peace in this country. They should
etly without making any unfounded allegations to-
wards our party. Do they just want money or think
that they will may be promoted to higher ranks should
the new party win?

I know that is not my business, but I think | have to
ask the question as many people are joining that party,

Politically, itis always very easy to make Stories of
tell people lies about something very new, like a po.
litical party.I think many people really need orienta.
tion when it comes to political issues.

Fellow Namibians let us not be disunited by the
myths spread by politicians and let show these false
leaders that we didn’t Struggle to be misguided and
disunited. It is painful and we really must avoid and
be careful of those who brought war and apartheid to
Our country.

They must not be allowed to destabilise Our peace
so that they can once again take over.
