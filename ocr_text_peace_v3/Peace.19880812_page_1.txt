Meesage to you because of rumours of

peace

My dear Namibiana, do you know
that there are seven chief human
wants in life? Theee are: air tobreathe,
water to drink and for domestic pur-
poses adequate, wholesome and
norishing food; Landon which to build
our houses; sufficient clothing to keep
us warm and enable us to conform with
accepted standards of decency; fire or
fuel to enable us to cook our food; and
a shelter to protect us from the sun,
wind and rain

Ifthe Namibian nation is deprived
of these needs by s certain greedy
group of people; that greedy group errs
against God's will and against the
whole of humanity. Sa, no government
(nobody) has right to keep away these
natural wants from any individual
Because the youth of today is the future
generation, I think it is of paramount
importance for the youth of Namibia
to watch critically and see if there is
any violation of these wanta If there
16 a violation, what is the necessary
resistance our youth need to render? If
our air is being polluted, I feel it isthe
responsibility of our youth to take an
active stand in order to protest that
evil If few people have sufficient food
and water while many people have not,
againitremainsthe right ofour youth
to analyse the root cause of such evil
Namibia is a “spacious” country as
every bady says, but the freedom toown
a prece of land is deliberately threaten.
ed by the high price of buying it
Because the land of Namibia isnot yet
in the hands of the owners (Nami-
bians}, the colonisers are making big
money from exploiting us. In order to
live a proper life, we need the land and
this remains the greatest task of the
youth of Namibia to struggle and
regainourland We, therefore, cannot
be a nation if we have no land

History can prove that the struggle
in Namibia isover the land inthe first
place and allother things like human
rightaetc come second The struggle
waged by our political forefathers such
as Witbooi, Mandume, Mahareroand
many others, was the struggle for our
right to keep the land. They tried to
their very best efforts to resist thecol-
onisers’ take-over ofthe land Anyway,
they loat because they were not united,
but they are not defeated for we are
here to continue their resistance - on-
ly ifare united. Naturally, politically
and economically, Namibia is our land
and we want it back now.

Dear comrades and friends, freedom
1s what we desire - itis our destination.
Of course, freedom or independence
hae become an urgent want. In life,
every human being hasa task tofulfil.
We are the children of the progressive
parents and they did their beat in all!
their efforts to bring about the in-
dependence of our land. Yes, it becomes
now the role ofthe Namibian youth to
fulfil the dreams and aims of our
forefathers, Those dreams are very im-

As the late Martin Luther

King said: “I HAVE A DREAM.” and
the group, the Young Rescals said in
their song: “All the worid over, it's so

In your struggle for freedom, [know

tiality of your resistance to their evil -
system. Only you can bring about
nuine freedom and their downfall.
Bocause of money they blindly failled
tosee that every person(our youth too)
regardless of his station in life, has a
dignity and importance far greater
than a lower animal. It remains your
full duty to resiet anything that may
keep you away from the struggle for in-
dependence .. anything like economic
conscription, corruptive education,
“minds and hearts" winning program-
mee, etc

My beloved youth of Namibia, doyou
ayree with me that the struggle is over
the land in the first place? The im-
perialist governments are not in-
terested in Namibia because love
the Namibians They certainly donot
love us but they just fell deeply in love
with the land Namibia because she is
very rich. Now they are raping our
motherland. America, Britain, West
Germany and many other European
countries are more interested in
mineral resources our land produces
and not inthe Namibian people.

The South African soldiers and police
killed many Namibians because of the
land not because Namibianscommit-
ted any sin. The youth must be aware
of this fact that they must struggle, not
for a slice of bread or a loafofbread, but
for the whole bakehouse. We must free
the whole land of Namibia. All evil
powers of colonialiem and neo-
colonialism must be resisted. Col-
oniatiam is violance - oppression is
violence neo-colonialism is bribery or

betrayal which is aleo violence and alt,
these must be resisted. To revolt

because there is a violation of rights |
does not mean cuy.mitting violence as

oppressors tendj.o put it. We revolt

because we want to be free. Young .
Namubians, stand up and fight for your
rights - your country is your rights.

Letusbe vigilant and not be confus-
ed by what Icall “rumours of peace”
and stop the genuine process of the
struggle for freedom. Some of us may
say: let us stop a bit and see what will
happen. I say no, bece use to stop “a bit”
while there is nothing really achieved
is like putting a horse behind the cart.
Let us continue the struggle until all
our dreams and visions become a reali-
ty -a free united Namibia.

This struggte needs a young person's
prayer, mind, brain, energy, blood, tear
drop, and courage in order to achieve
freedom in totality. Thank you com-
rade H. Ya Toivo; you have spoken the

truth ty warning the youth of Namibia
that the “struggle is long and bitter”.
Thank you, certainly, Namibta has ber
own prophets.
