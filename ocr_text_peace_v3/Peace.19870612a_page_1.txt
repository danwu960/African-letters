Walvis bomb

IT IS a pleasure for me to write this
letter to The Namibian, because it is
the true newspaper of Namibia.

At the beginning of this year I was

with the bomb which exploded in the
Atlanta Meat Market in that town.

The socalled security police tried to
force me to take responsibility for the

and confiscated some of my
documents, which are until today,
still in their possession.

leaders of tomorrow.

Comrades, pray for Resolution 435
and elections under the supervision
of the United Nations because this is
the peaceful solution for our beloved
Namibia.
