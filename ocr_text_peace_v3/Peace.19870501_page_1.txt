Reply to Kozo

WE HAVE read, with interest, a letter
received from Minister Kozonguizi
typed on a letterhead of the Depart.
ment of Information, indicated that
even such letters are done at the tax-
payer's expense.

Minister Kozonguizi's epistle is
what hecalisa “review” of our booklet
- “The Choice - Namibia Peace Plan
435 or Society under Siege”.

The booklet attempts to present
Namibians with the facta and by the
provision of these facts and the
analysis of these facts, to strengthen
the commitment of all those who call
for immediate implementation of
Resolution 435 of 1978.

It constitutes analysis as wellasad-
vocacy. It stands however in stark con-
trast tothe type of advocacy and distor.
tion of facts by the Honourable
Minister and al! thoee institutions,
parties, groups, persons and
mouthpieces with whom the
Honourable Minister, his government
and the South African Government, is
closely associated.

It presents the truth in rebuttal of
the propaganda daily poured out for
Mr Kozonguizi’s cause and financed by
millions, if not billions of Rand from
the pockets of the South African and
Namibia taxpayers, and in the case of
Namibia - without the consent of the
taxpayers and without the consent of
Namibians.

If ever there was denigration
without facts and without reason, you
see it inthe Minister’s letter which is
typical of the mass of propaganda com.
ing from that source.

According to the learned advocate
who has never practiced in this coun-
try, advocacy is unethical or un-
professional conduct for an advocate.
Does he not know that lawyers, ad-
vocates and judges do not only
analyse facts, but also come to con-
clusions, make submissiona and
reach judgements on the facts.

Why aconstitution before anelec-
tion? This matter is dealt with ade-

quately in our booklet and readers are
referred to it.

We can all agree that aconstitution
is one of the most important pillars of
a stable democratic state - if not the
very foundation of it. But surely such
an important basic document must
represent the will of the people of
Namibia otherwise it will have to be
imposed and then it will not be worth
the paper on which it is written. To
represent the will of the people, it
follows that only truly elected
representatives of the people can
represent the will of the people.

And toelect such representatives of
the people who will then draw upacon-
stitution for Namibia, in the exercise
of their self-determination and right
to independence, is the very aim and
essence of Resolution 435 of 1978.

After the constitution so drawn up by
the elected representatives, there
could be a further election for the first
government of Namibia in termsofthe
agreed constitution. That will in effect
mean aconstitution before anelection
for a Namibian government.

In the case of Namibia, however,
there already exists an international
agreement, on the inclusion of certain
specified constitutional principles and
fundamental human rights in the
future constitution of Namibia and
also safeguards for the protection of
minorities in the form of a provision for
proportional representation and for
the further details of the constitution
to be decided upon by at least a two-
thirds majority.

So it is clear that even here a com-
promise has already been reached
between those who want a constitution
first and those who want an election
before a constitution.

Swapo has consistently stood by the
peace plan and the democratic elec-
tions provided for in it, whereas
Minister Kozonguizi, Minister
Shipanga and others show no sign of
suggesting any sort of country-wide
elections to legitimise their appoint-
ments by the SA Government. Have
you redefined democracy, Minister
Kozonguirzi? If so, please let the “‘in-
telligent”’ readers have your definition
and your government's plan of action
for democracy, self-determination and
internationally recognised
independence.

If your vague allegations against
Swapo are trut, you should welcome
elections in terms of Resolution 435 of
1978 because then you can attack and
denigrate Swapo in their presence in
front of the Namibian people. The
peace plan provides for the return of all
refugees and one can imagine the
many witnesses then becoming
available to substantiate these
charges, iftrue. Why miss such anex-
cellent opportunity to free the tortured
refugees and confront Swapo face to
face? The Namibian people can then be
the judges. When the Honourable
Minister denigrates Swapo, he should
remember that he himself set out the
options for Namibian resistance after
the 1966 World Court decision on
Namibia, when in an article in African
Forum, he declared: ‘In fact, the deci-
sion of the International Court of
Justice has had one positive result: It
has underlined, for the people of South
West Africa, thata direct confrontation
with the Government of South Africa
may be inevitable Unless the South
West Africans are prepared to work
from within, to rely primarily upon
themselves, to mobilise their own
physical and moral resources, it is dif.
ficult to see how, in the forseeable future,
South Africa can be uprooted from its
entrenched position within the Ter.
ritory. Since experience has taught
Africans that external intervention in
a struggle for liberation has never pro-
ved decision against an organised in-
ternal force ltke that of South Africa,
final victory in South West Africa can
be guaranteed only by a disciplined
resistance movement, abovue-or
underground, within the country
self"

“Hf this ts the case, then the choices
before the people of South West Africa,

whether political or military, are only
four: In the political realm the choices
seem to be three: (1) capitulation - by
which I mean that South West Africa
may bow to fate by accepting the South
African settlers and abiding by the dic
tates of the Pretoria government; (2)
negotiation - tn the hope that the SA
Government may modify tts position -
which would amount to capitulation,
(3) indifference - in the hope that other
countries, other powers, may take up
their struggle and attain freedom for
them. None of these, especially the first,
seems very likely.

The fourth is armed struggle -
which is always easier to discuss than
to plan, easier to organise than tocarry
out, for tt must be pursued with
ruthless determination to win and
it must be reinforced by a princip}-
ed dedication to the cause. From
thier public pronouncements, it seems
clear that the leaders of South West
Africa are moving in the direction of
armed struggle”.

It appears that the Honourable
Minister has since 1966 accepted the
first option above viz. “Capitulation...”

What basis do Namibians have for
believing that the interim government
willabide by whatever constitution it
might draw up, when it is responsible
tonoelectorate having never facedan
election?

Excuse of UN Partiality: We
acknowledge in our booklet the fact of
UN partiality, but we explain why it
will not have any effect on the judge-
ment of Namibians in a 435 election.
But why don't you acknowledge South
Africa’s partiality? Why not?

The Honourable Minister of Justice
has often inthe past reiterated that in
Africa power comes from the barrel of
agun, and we suspect that he and some
of his associates have accepted this
credo.

It seems futile to argue with the
Minister about free and fair elections.
If interested in elections at all, it will
have to be elections which he can be
guaranteed to win - and free and fair
elections are unlikely to lead to that
result.

Negotiation and Reconciliation
before Independence: There is
nothing wrong with this aim in prin-
ciple. But this aim must be bona fide
and the opportunities for negotiation
and reconciliation not abused as hap-
pened in 1961 in Geneva and 1984 in
Lusaka.

Itis not a requirement of of the peace
plan for Swapo to “sign a ceasefire
document with South Africa” even
though it may be useful if they do. All
that is required is that both SA and
Swapo indicate their willingness toim-
plement a ceasefire So the alleged
disadvantage to ani-Swapo parties in
that Swapo will gain ‘prestige’ by
signing a ceasefire document withSA,
does not exist.

Minister Kozonguizt’s government's
existence isin breach of its own socall-
ed BillofFundamental Rightsinthat
the said Bill provides that a govern.
ment derives its power and capacities
from the consent of the people Such
consent it never obtained and Minister
Kozonguizi also shows no intention to
face the electorate.

In conclusion we note that Minister
Kozonguizi has, despite his long
treatise, not told us whether his
government wants to stop the war
and if so how it will achieve this, in
view of the fact that it has no con.
trol over defence, security and
foreign affairs.

We undertake to be constructive and
even handed. We will the Minister and
his colleagues will in future do the
same. We can begin with a televised
debate on the issue ifthe Honourable
Minister can arrange this with the
Government's television station in
Namibia.
