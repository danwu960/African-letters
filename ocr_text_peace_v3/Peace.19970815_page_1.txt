A Crime A Minute ..-

] AM a Namibian male, aged 27 and
have spent 5 years of my life in prison.
I have since been released and have
found that the alarming increase in
crime in our society to be a very wor-
rying factor. There are different types
of crime in our country, e.g. theft,
murder, rape, metal and physical abuse,
etc. Crime isa wrong committed against
the state for which criminals are pun-
ished. It is depressing to know that a
crime iscommitted nearly every minute
of the day and that someone in our
beautiful country is either being in-
jured, raped of murdered by an ele-
ment of our society who cither has no
feeling or conscience. People must
cooperate with the police in order make
their job easier. Parents should keep an

eye on their children and act immed:
ately if they suspect that there 1s cause
for concem, Also, youngsters should
avoid places like night clubs because
these are very dangerous places for a
young person to spend time. The time
has come for the public to take a visible
stand against people who wish to pro-
mote lawlessness in our society. They
should be treated like enemics. I call on
all Namibians ... Iet us all go down on
our knees and pray to God to intervene
and to bless us with peace, love and
understanding. As long as we allow
criminals to enjoy a free reign in our
community we will never know peace.
