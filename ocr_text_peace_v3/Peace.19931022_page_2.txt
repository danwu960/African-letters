the ethics and responsi-
bilities that govern our
profession or calling.

It is against this beck-
ground that I congratu-
late the office of the
Prime Minister and the
Prime Minister himself
for having organised and
addressed the recent in-
formative and educa-
tional workshop for per-
manent secretaries. This
was democracy in action.

The Prime Minister
spoke of assessment of
public feelings. This is
an important point, but
how can one assess peo-
ple’s feelings if one has
adopted the concept of
being exclusive? It ts
through socialisauion that
one can effectively as-
sess the staff and the gen-
cral public's feelings to-
wards one's perform-
ances.

As civil servants we
should always remember
that whatcver we say, do,
and whatever our objec:
tives arc, it is the civil
service unity of action
which make up the chain
of development and if
one of the staff break
down in terms of think-
ing, initiative and crea-
tivity, in spite of the
strength of other remain-
ing members of the chain,
this chain will cease to
be active.

According to E M
Debrah, ‘civil servants
are highly respected per-
sons who at all umes are
supposed to exhidil a:
sense of dedication to
their duties and absolute
respect for the rules’.

Civil servants are the
ambassadors and mirrors
from which the image
and wishes and aspira-
tions of the government
and the people of the
country are reflected.

[1 is imperative to say
that the concept of being
exclusive, indecisive,
dismissive, rude and im-
polite is incompatible
with democracy, peace,

and a healthy
working relationship.
There is therefore, a need
for more seminars simi-
lar to that held at Gross
Barmen. We have much
to lear in terms of indi-
vidual commitment, a-
oa ity, reaponsibil-
ve and loyalty.

only when we be-
eve in the concept of
assessment of public
opinion and oufown per
