Call for international conference

FIRSTLY. I wish tocongratulate the
staff of The Namibian.

Secondly, I would like to express
my point of view.

It is now over seven months since
the interim government was install-
ed in Windhoek. No significant
change has come about in Namibia
except that repressive laws, such as
AG 8, AG 9and AG 26, are still strong
and alive.

Tens of thousands of our people
are walking about in search of jobs

The socalled Ministers talk most
of the time on TV about ‘good
human relationships’ and ‘more job
Opportunities’ for the citizens of this
country.

We wonder whether these
Ministers are blind to the real situa.
Gon. Katuturais a mere stone’sthrow
away from the Tintenpalast and

Wh

some members of the National
Assembly even live in Katutura. They
know very well the bad conditions in
existence there

In this country the population is
about one milhon, yet the Govern.
ment can il afford to run a charity
food programme for citizens Boh
Geldof, the London-based rock star,
can dou for morethan three million
starving Ethiopians.

Gentlemen, who do you think you
are fooling when youcall yourselses
the leaders of the oppressed people
of Namibia?

Stop shouting at one another in
the air-conditioned Turnhalle. That
is not the way to find a solution for
the problems of this country

The basic root of our problem 1s
apartheid Our problems also he in
education and joblessness. The

The controversial issue which re.

Ng a quick survey of our black high
schoals you are told that hundreds ot
students are turned away because of
lack of accomodation in the hostels
or because of examination failures.

Those in charge of education
should take this. situation very
seriously.

At the same time | appeal to ait
teachers to play an active role so that
they can help to fill the gap whichis

Created by the apartheid poticy of the
former Bantu education.

Long live The Namibian. Mav
God bless the staff with courage.
