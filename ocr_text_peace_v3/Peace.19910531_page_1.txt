Swapo before and during
process of elections tnat
‘Sovth Africa had a hidden
Agenda for Namibia.
These revelations have once
_ More strengthened the belicf
of many Namibians that SA
rigged the elections in favour
of the DTA.
Until such time as the DTA
and its leaders prove to the
nation thal they no longer re-
ceive money and advice from
SA, we will continue to doubt
their integrity and dedication
to peace and security in the
country.

Peace and independence has
cost the lives of many Namibi-
ans.

It is my belief that an inter-
national commission of inquiry
must beset up to investigate
the extent of SA involvement
in those elections.

punished for the crimes they
have committed, anarchy will
continue to reign in this coun-
{ry and no one will fear to
commit even treason against
the sovercignity of this coun-
try. We must remember where
injustices prevail, people tend
to take the law into their own
hands.

The relative peace we are
enjoying is artificial especially
when we have certain people |
in Our midst in strategic places
Where they cancontinue to use |
and oppress the people of this |
country.

We must look at ourselves
and decide whether what we
are doing 1s right or not and the
vanous reasons for that. Are
our acuons building or destroy-
ing the very foundations we
are trying to build?

It is for this reason I believe
the allegations made by Bas-
son must be taken seriously.
The Government should set up
a commussion to investigate.

We disagree with the writer
