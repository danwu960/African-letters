Church & politics

IS IT possible to talk about church and
politics at the same time? Do the two
have anything in common? Can the
church mix with politica? Such ques.
tions and more similar questions are
struggled with in the context of
Namibia in particular. Such questions
are both theological and political. For-
tunately, theological and political
questions are asked by human beings
who are involved either.in the church
and/or politics in one way or another.

My aim here is to open up a
theological and political debate for
concerned people in a situation of apar-
theid, colonialism, racism, exploita-
tion and draconian laws such as those
of Namibia. I am stating only
preliminary remarks, sparing the rest
for contemplated responses.

The truth of the matter is that the
Church cannot claim its existence
without people Likewise politics can.
not be without people. It is the people
whoconstitute the church. it isthe peo-
ple who politicise. The basicconcernof |
the church is wider and broader than
its numerical] membership It is within
the framework of the Church's pro-
phetic call and public responsibility to
aspire for peace, justice, freedom,
respect of human rights and dignity to
all people irrespective of their stations
in life. On the other hand, the Church |
is not serving angels, but human be-
ings whoee basic needs-amongothers _
- include food, shelter, clothing and
security or safety. In essence, these

needs cannot be secured without some
