DEEPLY shattered by the
immense increase in the
worldâ€™s social evils, espe-
cially in this generation, |
am depnved of any choice
but to express my dismay
and that of great people who
sull believe in peace.

This century has expen-
enced the most homfic and
disastrous violence imposed
onthe most vulnerable peo-
ple. women and children.
Our menhave become heart-
less and tyrannies symbol-
ising a world leading to
chaos, selfishness and ag-
gression towards neigh-

a

Evil Has No Borders

bours. Evidence of ill-treat-
mentis not difficult to find:
for instance the suppression
of women in Afghanistan.
Womoenare forced under the
veil and are given noor little
freedom.

Most of the world seems
not to be showing any genu-
ine sympathy or taking joint,
firm action against viola-
tors of human nights. It is
mystifying to understand
how or why any human be-
ing can torture or show ag-

gression to especially the
most feeble and defenceless
of all.

Even babies as little as
only nine months are vic-
ums of these evil deeds.

Babies are greeted with
hatred and torture instead of
love and secunty. Citizens
are brutally murdered and
our elders depnved of the
respect and protection they
deserve.

It is confusing how our
leaders enthusiastically

preach about peace and hu-
man rights and at the same
time enjoy power and wealth
while the citizens are suffer-
ing. Some leaders are even
unfaltenngly proud of per-
seculing innocent people for
pretty cnmes .

I believe that itis our duty
to safeguard human dignity,
protect human nghts and
most of all, the importance
of life. It should be our
number one pnonty because
evil has no borders.
