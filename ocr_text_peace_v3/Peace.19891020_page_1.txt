UN and alcohol

I WOULD like to call on Namibian
patriots to take up full responsibility and
refrain from encouraging Untag personnel
to drink, because this is preventing them
from carrying out their duties.

If Untag has come to Namibia to keep
the peace, I wonder how they can achieve
this if many of them are often drunk. In
many Cases too they are after women, as if
this is also their responsibility.

Please UN representatives, see to it that
your personnel are told to adhere to what
they have been brought here for.
