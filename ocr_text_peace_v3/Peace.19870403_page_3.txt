What you did will not work, Ms Lister. You
forget that Col Radmore is not Christian Ac-
tion. You. forget that Col Radmore is a
disciplined Christian who does not hesitate
to acknowledge his strong belief in and love
for the Lord in public. You fail to appreciate
the fact that Col Radmore is one of the many
who knows what atrocious and senseless

Hundreds of people support Christian Ac-
tion, Ms Lister. Many, many Christians
have contributed financially and otherwise
to enable Christian Action to reach out to
fellow-Christians to inform them who the

real enemy is, and to tell how certain
