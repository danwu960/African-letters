Tell the truth 7

A LOT of confusion is deliberately be-
ing created about Resolution 435. The
only way to demystify the said Resolu-
tion is to publish Resolution 435, the
Contact Group's plan for Namibia and
other wie e documents for all

- The honourable Administrator
General is adding to the confusion by
repeating issues that were long since
dealt with. Are his pronouncements
aimed at shipwrecking the present
negotiations, or are they an indication
of South Africa's unwilling participa-
tion in the talks?

The question of the socalled ‘UN par.
tiality’ was addressed to the satisfac-
tion of the SA Government from 1978
to 1982. South Africa was satisfied to
such an extent that at one pointthe SA
Minister of Foreign Affaira went on
record saying the ‘Cuban issue” was
the only obstacle to the implementa.
tion of Resolution 435.

It is however, important to state that
it is not only the UN that must be 1m-
partial. The same impartiality 18 ex.
pected from the office of the Ad.
ministrator General. Both the Special
Representative of the UN's Secretary
General and the SA representative -1n
terms of435-are meant toobserve im.
partiality during the implementation
of 435.

It is thus questionable:
} for a South African Government
representative to tell Namibians who
their enemy is, thus pushing them to
unite Isitto safeguard South African
snteresta? Would anybody who claims
to be a true Namibian really want to
be directed by a South African Govern-
ment official in his aspirations? This
ig ample proof that the AG really can-
not lay claim to impartiality.
C) what about South Afri ca’s support
for the socalled internal-parties,
moral and material? Wil that stopor

C what about the impartiality that |
needs to be shown by institutionslike |
SWABC radio and television, by the
Post Office? What steps is South Africa
taking in respect of this? We cannot
forget the non-availability of ©
te andtelexes for the Patriotic
Front at the time of elections in 1980.

The double talk: peace and in-

fusion. t, it makes it dif
ficult to believe that South Africa ia
serious and honest about its ,
to leave Namibia.
