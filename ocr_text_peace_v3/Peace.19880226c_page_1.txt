Not Swapo bomb

SWAPO has nothing to do with the
bomb blast at Oshakati.l am only one
of the many Namibians who will
neither agree nor accept racist South
Africa’s malicious propaganda cam-
paign against Swapoand the people of
Namibia. South Africa through its
puppets and mass media continue to
deceive and mislead Namibians as to
the true situation in our country.

I feel deeply hurt at the loss of lives
ofinnocent civilians at Oshakati. Itis
not the first time that the people of
Namibia are intimidated, harrassed
and killed by the racists of Pretoria.

Who was responsible? There are
many instances as examples, 1981
bomb blast at Oshakati Post Office, for-
tunately noinjuries; 1998 bomb blast
at Okatana service Station, killing two
Americans and a local businessman,
Mr Nakambonde; 1985 bomb blast at
Ondangwa Post Office, killing many
people including children; 1985 bomb

blast at the Ongwediva Training Cen-
tre, fortunately nocasualties; 1986 so-
meone tried to plant a bomb at Mr
Frans Indongo’s Continental Super-
market, fortunately he wascaught red-
handed and felt very ashamed; 1986
security forces tried to plant a bomb for
CDA President Peter Kalangula, but
this too failed.

Further still, there are many, many
Namibians who have either been kill-
ed or who disappeared, andl amciting
the following examples; Mathias
Ashipembe, David Sheehama,
Fillemon Elifas, Joseph Dumeni and
many others. These are merely some
examples of atrocities committed by
South Africa against the people of
Namibia, and for which Swapo gets the
blame.

Many Namibians do not have homes
or property any more, as these have
been destroyed by the racist’s Casspirs.
Swapo has never committed any such
act against the people ofthis country,
which we cannot say about South
Africa. Racist South Africa is to be
blamed for numerous atrocities
against Namibians, and I call upon the
international community to quickly
intervene. We, the people of Namibia
will continue to. call for your
withdrawal from our beloved land,
even if you rape, imprison, maim, kill
and destroy our property. We call upon
you, racist South Africa, to uncondi-
tionally withdraw your forces from
Namibia and to allow the implemen-
tation of UN Resolution 435, so that
peace and juatice may come to our |
