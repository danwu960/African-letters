monotonous. Soldiers in bases
around the country have no
work to do, xcept continuous
manocuvres and this brings
boredom.

On many occasions soldiers
are told to attend classes but
due to boredom they go absent
without leave,

My suggestion is that the
| Ministry should take advan-

tage of this, and utilise the
soldiers in bases in these times
of peace.

lt would be better if the
Ministry could provide build-
ers to show soldiers how to
construct their own barracks
and provide them with bull-
dozers and tractors to take part
in agncultural projects.

If we keep our soldiers busy
with productive tasks as well
43 constructive ones, this will
give us a good reputation with
the nation.

Soldiers need to be. taught
skills so that they could join
workers’ brigades with better
qualifications whenever they
leave their posits,

The more they produce, the
more they will reserve; the more
they construct, the more: thoy
