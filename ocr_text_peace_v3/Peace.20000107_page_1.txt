IN a democracy such aS Ours, peo-
ple are generally allowed to ex-
themselves freely on issues
of the day. Conversely, others are
normally expected to be tolerant of
those views provided such views
are expressed within the limits of
the right of freedom of
expression. That is tte.
However, after having read
Frederick B Philander’s letterin The
Namibian of 23 December 1999
(Ulenga’s Faux Pas), ] had the feel-
ing that Mr. Philander abused this
basic fundamental right. In fact, his
sentiments would have gone unno-
ticed had he not resorted to antics

erance and national reconciliation.
In his feeble attempt to highlight
reasons why the CoD failed to make
a significant impact in the just con-

cludedelections. Philander c™ '

Philander’s Faux Pas

wards the wishes of the people and
a total disregard for the democratic
process in Namibia.

Philander claims that the major-
ity of the Oshiwambo-speaking
people voted Swapo back into
power. Ido not think it is necessary
to go into the modalities of such a
wayward claim. It would be more
appropriate to say however, that
Swapo scored eleven out of the
thirteen regions of Namibia. That
means from north to south, east to
west. Some of us in the analytic
community read this to mean that
development under a Swapo gov-
ernment has taken place
countrywide and the people thus
voted for a continuance of this de-
velopment. invaluable pesce and

tranquilsty. Ics quite obvious that
cither Philander tums ablindcyeto

rhese realities or he has difficulty in

reconciling with these facts.
Philander further goes on to fc-
veal his ignorance and confusion
with the term one-party state and
the constitutional amendment im
favour of the presidential third term.
Let me enlighten him. A one-party
state is characterised by the consu-
tutional provision that only one
political party 1s recognised by the
state. Namibia being a democratic
country, this is highly inconceiv-
able. Philander expressing Ppesst-
mistic views obviously does not
have faith in the Namibian democ-
racy. As for the amendment to the

constitution, the constauuion has

been legally and democratically
amended to allow for a third term
Nothing more than that.

Like 1 said earher, Philander’ s

views would have gone unnoticed
had he not resorted to insulting the Namibians ine

electorate who voted Swapo into
power. In his failure to understand
why people have spoken the way
they did, he suggests that the masses
“mustreally have their heads ¢xam-
ined”. He further questions “the in-
tellectual and mental state of the
nation” and suggests grass 1eno-
rance. These insults are clearly a
flagrant abuse of his night to free:
