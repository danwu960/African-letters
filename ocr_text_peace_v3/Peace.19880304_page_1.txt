. peoples’ bank?

hi hibh time that Namibians be
de aware of the racist and selfish
dencies of the management of the
alled First National Bank, Barclays
noréhern Namibia.
Jarclays Bank has been doing
sfnegs in northern Namibia for
ars now, but still, itis very clear thet
management never had the ib-
ests of our people at heart. .
The management of that bank does
tcare about black Namubians, they
p always served as third class. Black
ymibians are made to queue for
ars outside in the dust and heat as
they are not human beings.
The racists that are running the
arciays Bank have made special ar-
ngementa for whites in Oshakatito
ive better service and also their own
rencies through which to channel!
onies and in s0 doing to avoid the
od of suffering and delay that blacks
ave to live up with.
The quality of service rendered at
1is bank for black people is very, very
oor, There is no provision for
pperate savings and current account
epartments, causing people to queue
ip in the same line.
People living in far-lying areas such
a Ombaiantu, Uukwaluudhi,
luacana, Niongo, jera and s0
orth are the ones that suffer most.

You are directly and indirectly

deeds will not be left unpunished.

We salute you, Comrade Nambondi,
