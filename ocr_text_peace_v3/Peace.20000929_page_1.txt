Kavango A Living Hell

I AM a Kavango student
_ beset in Windhoek and

crisis situation in the
Kavango is going from bad
to worse.

Government's reaction
| towards this problem is a
; complete riddle to me.
| What is the use of just sit-
| ng in luxurious offices,
peacefully and quietly,
while life is really a living
hell in the Kavango. The
Government should rather
find a solution to this mat-
ter, instead of just saying it
is the people of the
Kavango themselves who
are collaborating with
Unita.
. Let’s come to a reason-

criminations against each
other. This situation where
Kavangos cannot even
enjoy the basic pleasure of
peace, progress, prodper-
ity and stability should not
continue like this. I feel we
need the total deportation
of the MPLA from Nami-
bian soil. Zambia has done
it, why not Namibia too?
One thing the Govern-
ment should be aware of is
that Unita’s banditry ac-
tivities are always on CNN
and this will discourage
more tourists from com-
ing to Namibia. So we will
lose anyway, as our coun-
try’s economy depends on
tourism and this is reason
enough for foreign busi-
ness people not to invest
their shares in Namibia,
especially the Kavango.
Some of the schools in

the Kavango, like Max WINDHOEK

Makushe Secondary
School, Linus Shashipapo
and others won't have
physical science or math-

interested in coplyintt ;
these schools due to thea
unstable situation in the
Kavango. In this way the
economy and academic
issues will gradually be
affected.

So the Government
should not yust stand by. it
must do something - de-
mand the total withdrawal
of the MPLA from the

Kavango.
Unita banditry acuvities
should not only be

Kavangoconcems, butthe
whole of Namibia as ‘one
Namibia, one nation’.
