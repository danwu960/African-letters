READERS’ LETTERS

IT READ with interest and
some amusement your
editonal of Friday Sep-
tember 8 2000 on what
you referred to as “mud-
dling of words”.

Being a journalist my-
self, [know exactly what
you are talking about. 1
have alsoexpenenced the
frustration of trying to fig-
ure out the meaning of
sentences and paragraphs
in media releases.

However, I have real-
iscd that it can be danger-
ous to make assumptions
onthe ground of statements
made in such releases.

Since you referred in
your editorial to a media

release issued by the Min-

WT “4@ 4 ro

Reading Between The Lines

istry of Foreign Affairs
Information and Broad-
casting, I feel compelled
to point out to you the
dangers of assuming the
meaning of statements.
You quoted me as saying
that: “The future of the
elephant that attacked the
tourists will be decided
once a full investigation
into the circumstances of
the incident has been
completed.” From this
you deduced and even
suggested that it would
have been better to

straightforwardly inform
the public that the el-
ephant will be killed.
You assumption. which
you clearly qualified with
“we think” in brackets.
was wrong. In fact the
Ministry of Environment
and Tourism has already
confirmed, upon the out-
come of the investigation,
that the elephant cow that
was responsible for the
attack would not be killed.
It is, therefore, clear
that your assumed option
was incorrect. The other

options that we consid-
ered were to leave the
animalin peace ortodnve
it back to the possible re-
stncted area from where
itescaped, which was not
the case in this instance.
Being aware of at least
three options to be con-
sidered insofar as the fu-
ture of the elephant was
concemed it would have
been very irresponsible if
the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Information and
Broadcasting phrased the
sentence, which moti-

are C184. 242 nn Uict Re

vated you to mention our
release in your editorial,
differently.

The Mimstry of Envi-
ronment and Tounsm 1n-
formed me that the cir
cumstances surrounding
attacks of wild animals
on humans would deter-
mine what action to be
taken.

Very often animals are
not to blame, but rather
people who disregard all
safety aspects when it
comes to encounters with
wild animals. If an ant-

mal attacks when tt ts
stalked to be photo-
graphed, the animal can-
not be branded a problem
animal,

Such an animal reacts
on instinct to protect it
self, its terrtory or its off-
spring. It ts exactly be-
cause of the unpredicta-
bility of wild animals that
people, and especially
tounsts, are cautioned not

to leave their vehicles or
come too close to such

animals.
