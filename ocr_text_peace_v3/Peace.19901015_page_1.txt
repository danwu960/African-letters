Allen complaints

I WOULD Like to reply to the letter
‘Unfair to aliens’ of October 2, by
‘Fed-up Alien’. It is clear from the
fetter that the anonymous writer suf-
fers from racism. My concem here,
however, is to put the matter right.

First and foremost, I hope the water
is aware that every country has a law
relating to ‘aliens’, ‘foreigners’ and
‘illegal immigrants’ or whatever one
prefers tocall them. Such laws serve
a number of purposes. First, they
protect the security of the country.
Second, to keep a record of aliens in
the event of a population census.
Thirdly, to enable law enforcement
machinery to effectively control border
traffic.

In response to your letter, it is my
opinion that many foreigners who
came to Namibia in the past five
years did not do so because they
loved Namibia. Neither did people
from South Africa come here be-
cause they did not agree what was
happening there. After all, at that
time the same things were happening
in both countries.

If they thought what was happen-
ing in South Africa was wrong, they
should have stayed and applied their
‘skills and experiance’ to exert pres-
sure for change. However, these
‘skilled’ people preferred to come
and take advantage of the peace brought
about by the ‘unskilled labour’ of
Namibia.

The govemment must adhere to
the constitution, which is the su-
preme law of the land. It applies to
everyone, whether goverment
employes or not, or whether black,
i, Asian, of African.

foreigners arrived here for different
reasons. Many of them were not
genuine. Is it not surprising to you
that most people involved in dia-
mond emuggling, rhino and ivory are
foreigners?

You claim that ‘aliens’ and ‘South
Africans’ are the only people with
skills. Many South Afncans here came
because they could not be absorbed
in the South African economy. They
did not all come here with skills and
expenence - the colonial policy was
to provide job opportunit#s here for
those people at the expense of the
Namibians. Namibia has been used
as a laboratory for upgrading and
training South Afncan unskilled
labour.

The people who yame back from
exile are Namubiac‘citizens. They
were bom here and their parents and
relatives are here.

They were fighting for the inde-
pendence of this country and are
fully qualified as citizens.

We do not see many signs of the
‘skilled’ te the ‘unskilled’ here.
L hope you will take the lead.

You cannot claim to be patriotic to
one country while carrying dual citi-
zenship. ‘Fed-up Alien’, the south-
etn borders are open.
