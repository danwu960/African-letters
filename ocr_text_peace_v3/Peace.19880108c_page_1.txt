Release Angula

We urgently call upon the South
African Government to release com-
rade Jason Angula, whom they have
detained since October 6, 1987.

We, who are his close friends and
comrades, strongly condemn the
cowardly action by the racist and il-
legal Pretoria regime for creating in-
human laws which provide for con-
tinued detention without trial of
peace-loving Namibians.

We strongly condemn Pretoria’s op- |
pressive policies and demand that the
regime withdraw from Namibia.

Let the racists also know that such
actions will never make us abandon
the struggle or even intimidate us, |
because we are proud of Jason Angula
as one of our true leaders.
