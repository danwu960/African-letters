Remember
Simbwaye
HONOUR should be given to

the former Vice President of
Swapo, Brendan Simbwaye,

who disappeared 28 years ago. —

It was late moming of March
1964 in Katima Mulilo when

the news spread into the vil- —

lages that Simbwaye was kid- —

napped at gunpoint from the
local prison by the SA Police.

He appears to be forgotten
on the political map. He fell

_ victim to the police after ad-

dressing a rally at Mapulo, today
known as Ngwezi. During the
incident, 16 people were
wounded. | :
His disappearance did not
stop the fight for freedom and
independence, but rather sharp-
ened the struggle in that area.
Thousands of Caprivians are
still asking themselves what
the police did with their brother.
Simbwaye’s death is highly
spoken of by many in the area
as a great loss, not only to
Namibians who knew him but
many who had heard of him.
While in office the SA Po-
lice showed Caprivians that the
best way to do away with an
order fighting for independ-
ence was to arrest, torture,
intimidate, and put injail those
‘who were. active in the
struggle. . |

Urging Mafwe and Masubia —

‘to unite as one in the struggle
for unity. and independence,
| .wias'Simbwaye’s buming goal.

dionity modesty,
