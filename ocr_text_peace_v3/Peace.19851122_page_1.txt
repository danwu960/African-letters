Call not to blame those

who suffer for freedom

ALLOW ME TO answer and ask
some questions regarding a letter in
The Namibian of November 7. |
would like to appeal to fellow Capriv-
ians to unite and settle their differ-
ences peacefully and then identify
the enemy.

The colonisers create a situation
where we are divided among our-
selves. To them this is an advantage.
It is the cancer of tribalism that is be-
ing practiced by our leaders that has
blinded all Caprivians so that they
have failed to recognise developmen-
tal needs in the Caprivi.

Please stop regarding your
brothers as Subia or Mafwe - that is
Promoting colonialism in the
country.

Please stop the false accusations
against Mr Muyongo. Whether you
are Subia or Mafwe, the UDP is for
peace, unity and freedom.

If you remain in Canu you will be
in the opposition party until death
and the majority will set up a
democratic government if needs be.

You also challenged Mr M uyongo
a

aa

to tell the world where Mr Simbwae
is. You know that both were nation-
alists and that Mr Simbwae was here
in 1973. By that time Mr Muyongo
was in Zambia. How can Mr Muyon-
go, who was in Zambia, know the
whereabouts of a man who disap-
peared in Caprivi?

Chief Moraliswani and Mr
Ngambela Kalundu and Mr M Mu-
jiwa know what happened to him.
Ask them.

Don’t blame somebody who
suffered for your freedom. When
you are in a war, you win or you lose,
you live or you die. Mr Muyongoand
his supporters did not come into
Caprivi and recruit schoolchildren at
gunpoint.

Mr Muyongo is a politician who

«has the support of over 86 percent of

the people. The situation and de-
velopment in Capriviis deteriorating
because of tribalism.
