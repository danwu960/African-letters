in the decolonisation of Namibia
use she opened that colonial door
through which South African col-
onialism entered Namibia.

As a Namibian, a victim of that
German colonialism, | was shocked
to read in the Windhoek Advertiser
of November 21 1986 that the Etango
movement received 30 000 Rand
from West Germany. This was an-
nounced by the socalled chief coor-
dinator of Etango, Mr Andre van der
Kolff.

Etango (like Koevoet which is link-
ed to the police) appears to be part of
the South African Defence Force, and
therefore linked to it. ‘‘Donations"’
from West Germany mean to every
Namibian: the financing the killing
of Namibians, prolonging the col.
onial rule they started, prolonging
the suffering of Namibians.

We also know that West Germany
supplies SA with military technology
and about 90 percent of the SADF
means of transport is from West Ger-

many. Now it is again ‘donations’
and we don’t know what the next will
be

Soon Namibia will be free and the
independent Namibia will draw up
a list identifying our friends and
those who supported liberation.
Those who are financing colonial
forces and their squads, such as
Koevoet and Etango, are already
creating their grounds not to appear
on that list where al] freedom and
peace-loving countries in the world
will appear.
