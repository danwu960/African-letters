I also urge CDM to do away with —

the ‘two-hospital' system - one for
the so-called migratory employecs
in their own country and the other for

whites and ‘permanent’ employees. |

The time has come to correct the

On proper leadership

I WOULD like to comment on the ;

pew organizations that have recently
been formed, namely, the TUN
(Teachers Union of Namibia) and the
NASEM (the Namibian Student
Education Movement).

Firstly, I would like to deal with
the new student body. In regard to its
claims that it has been formed as a
*‘geeutt of a leadership vacuum within
the student community in Namibia’
and, secondly, that the existing stu-
deot organizations have failed to

**proper leadership for
students because of their
Hinks with political partics’', I would
tthe to make the following comments.

Be is no surprise to me to read such
oni article because this is the case and
alwayshas been with reactionary and
Opportunistic forces whose aim has

been to mislead and infuse ideas of
the past colonia) administrations. In
my point of view, the student move-
ment has been farmed to foster the
interests and political ideals of their
respective political parties who are
at present on ‘death row’.

Thoy see clearly that Nanso, which
has been a progressive student or-
ganization in the past, has won a
victorious fight against the regimo
thar rlegalty occupied our country,
and which suppressed most of the
students and people of Namibia.

There was no leadership vacuum
in Nanso. This can be proved by its
winning of the objectives it stood for.
Nanso members and supporters have
been harassed, detained and even
expelled from schools because of
their political beliefs and quest for
freedom To say that Nanso has failed
to serve student interests, is mere
bias. Nanso leadership succeeded in
mobilizing students all over the
country. It made them realize that
their interests were being suppressed
and needed to be fought for. Nanso’s
liberation standpoints, therefore,
coincided with those of Swapo and
Nantu.

Nanso could not isolate itself from
Swapo because they had common
goals to achieve. To fight a war in
disunity is to give the enemy victory

and therefore students needed to be |

linked in order to be free, get better
education, proper housing, and well-
equipped libraries, etc.

Nanso did not look for or concen-
trate on student issues alone, mainly
because the dignity of the whole nation
was underpinned by the colonial
regime. As a student body consisting
of intellectuals, it had to take account
of the socio-economic situation in
the country. Students cannot only be
free at schoo! and ‘unfree’ when they
go home. Both students and their
parents needed to be liberated.

1am assuring the leadership of the

new organization thet Nets

tributed a lot to the tmeparsiecos 6f
this nation from foreign domination
and influence. I appeal to the new
organization not to create confasion
among students coumrywide. We
know whose interests they represent
and promote. They must stop swim-
ming in the pool of confusion. Their
organization was formed to counter-
act Nanso that has stood firm in
opposition to the abuse of human
rights.

My question to them is: if Nanso
failed to achieve what it fought for
and a leadership vacuum does exist,
then what have they achieved so far?

If you were serious, why didn’t
you form that organization months
ago, lo stand up against Koevoet
elements which used to disrupt les-
sons, beat up students, and erect army
bases at schools?

With regard the formation of the
TUN: it also has political motives in
their formation, which serve the same
purpose as that of the NASEM.

¢ organization has not been
formed to strive for teachers’ umty
and interests but to counteract Nantu.

Tappeal to teachers country wide to
be careful and cautious before join-
ing any altemative union which seeks
to divide the unity which already
prevails in our nation. They should
join the organizations who strive and
work for peace, nationhood and fra-
termty.

Forward with progressive people's
organizations.
