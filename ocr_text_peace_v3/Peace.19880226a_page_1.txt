Sick ef Bester

ALLOW me to express my heartfelt
disgust at Commandant G R C
Bester's childish, hopeless and self-
defeating comments which regularly
appear in this newspaper.

Asa patriotic and oppressed Nami-
bian citizen, I really feel compelled to
respond to Commandant ‘8
narrow-minded allegations against
the editor of this newspaper in par-
ticular and the entire oppreased but
fighting people of Namibia under the
leadership of Swapoa.

I would like to make it categorically
clear to Commandant Bester and his
masters in Pretoria that Swapo is the
people of Namibia and the people are
Swapo. If South Africa is trying to
destroy Swapa, then they must be try-
ing to destroy the the suffering Nami-
bian people. But the apartheid regime
will not succeed in destroying the peo
ple's movement. The apartheid govern.
ment has been trying to bring Swapo
to its knees for years, but all their ef-
forte were in vain

They haveeven tried to infiltrate the
organisation with spies, but none of
their dubious attempts have
succeeded.

Commandant Bester went on to ask
a foolish and shortsighted question
“Who opted for revolution?” The
answer is simple and clear: Swapo. But
the next question to which he should
provide us witha proper answer is why
Swapo resorted to armed liberation
struggle.

Swapo Secretary General, Andimba
Toivo ya Toivo made the movement's
position clear in the Sixties: ‘“Swapo
iteelf was a non-violent organisation,
but the South African government 18
not truly interested in whether oppose.
tion is violent or non-violent. It does
not-wish to hear any opposition to
apartheid”.

Furthermore, Swepo President Sam
Nujoma, made clear the position of
Gwapo with regard to the people's
revolution against colonial oppression
and exploitation at the WCC con-
ference in Lusaka last year. He said:.

“On the question of violence, we make
no apology for the fact that after acen-

military campaigns and unbridled
economic exploitation, our movement
had decided to take up arms to confront
colonial violence with armed self.
defence. It is enshrined in our move-
ment’s political programme that
Swapo does not glorify war. We wish
that nobody had ever forced ustohave
to fight a war of national liberation
But the reality of prolonged colonial
oppression in Namibia being what it
is. we have been left with no alter:
native but lo fight with armsin hand
for our liberty and right to self
determination and independence. To
those who would advise us not to fight
colonial oppreasion with arms in hand,
our answer is: ‘show us the available
non-violent means to Namibia’s in-
dependence and we shall follow’”’

The available peaceful means to
Namibian independence through UN
Resolution 435 has been deliberately
delayed by South Africa for ten years
Since 1981, the Swapo President has
expressed his genuine willingness to
sign a ceasefire with the South African
regime any where in the world but in
Windhoek or Pretoria. But what was
the response of South Africa? They said
it was ‘premature’ to sign a ceasefire
with Swapo.

On socalled ‘atrocities’ allegedly
committed by Swapo against the
civilian population of thia country, this
is wishful and baseless thinking onthe
part of the people who have failed to

tury of foreign oppression, genocidal

win the hearts and minds of the op-
pressed Namibians.

If Commandant Bester claims that
Swapo has no support, then does he
think the over 3000 people whoattend.
ed the recent Swapo public meeting in
Katutura were supporters of his
Government?

Commandant Bester cannot tell us
about the ways and means as to how
Namibians should achieve freedom
and national independence, since the
whole history of the Afrikaners in
South Africa and Namibia is written
in blood. How did they achieve their
gelf-determination from Britain?

Ithink it ishigh time Commandant
Bester stop writing rubbish to the peo-
plc's newspaper and should rather
send hie misleading and counter.
productive letters to the Koevoet
Koerant.

lappeal to the editor not to publish
any more of his letters, He hag access
toall necessary meansof propaganda
and should leave the-editor of this
newspaper and Dr A Shejavali of the
Council of Churches in peace.

I would like to close with the words
of ya Toivo, whosaidthat: “We believe
that South Africa hasa choice -either
to live at peace with usor tosubdue us
by force. If you choose to cruah us and
impoee your will on us then you not on-
ly betray your trust, but you will live
in security for only so long as your —
power is greater than ours. No South
Africa will live at peace in Namibia, for
each will know that hissecurity isbas- —
ed on force, and that without force he
will face rejection by the people of |
Namibia”. |
