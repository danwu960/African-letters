Loss Of Life Is Painful
For Both Rich And Poor

ALLOW me to express
my view on the recent at-
tack on America. Like
many others in the world
| was surprised and
shocked by the news. Na-
tions around the world
have already gone through
such painful experiences.

Amcrica is well known
for supporting state ter-
rorism and for its mass
killing of other nations.
As a growing African
child | could not help no-
lice the nightmares of war.
{ have seen a lot - from
Vietnamto Nicaragua. The
USA was a major sup-
porter of the apartheid
South African govern-
ment. which killed, bumed
to death and buried alive
my people. Nosingle mas-
sage of condolence was
sent from America; instead
they went on calling us
terrorists.

I don’t support terror-
ism, but we should not
forget that Washington
regards some groups of
people fighting for their

Top Post

as the calibre of leading the
jew and better dimension. |
tin my deepest conviction
e Honga, atechnocrat, with
leadership qualities, and
take, with a good political
the ideal candidate.

Jonga has an approach and
that has gained him great
roughout the years. Com-

fundamental rights or
freedoms as terrorists.
Once they called our
President. Sam Nujoma,
whois now ruling a peace-
ful country, a terrorist.

The word terrorist be-
came the right term tocall
any person or organisa-
tion determined to resist
or retaliate against atroci-
ties committed by the
world. if the Americans
really want peace in the
Middle East, why don’t
they withdraw all their
troops and go home? All
America is doing in the
Middle East is oil exploi-
tation, creating confusion
and hatred among the Ar-
abs and Muslims.

Yes, you are a free so-
ciety. Don tyou think that
freedom is needed in all
parts of the world? I think
ois high time for the
Amencans to learn from
their many, many mis-
takes and find a better so-
lution to problems be-
tween themselves and the
Arab world. When I look
at New York today, itcan-
not be compared to Beirut
in the 80s were almost
every building was
brought down and many
families penshed or dis-
placed. America sup-
poried Israel's aim to kill
and eliminate all people
in Lebanon. What did they
achieve? They supplicd
both Iraq, Iran with weap-
ons to kill each other,

killed innocent Libyans,
Iraqis. failed in Somalia
and next, it will be Af-
ghanistan.

The collapse of the
Twin Towers in New
York has a bad impact on
world’s cconomy for
those who currently ben-
efit trom it. The fact is
that New York Stock Ex-
change does not benef
men inthe mountains who
equally deserve to live in
acivilized free society in
countnes their own like
anyone else in the world.
The value of freedom and
peace 1s much more im-
portant to us than the value
of money.

If the Amencan Dollar
becomes useless on the
market Angola will prob:
ably be happy because it
will use its currency prop-
erly again, the Kwanza has
lost marked value duc to
criminals trading and us-
ing US dollars on the black
market.

My advice to Ameri!
cans is that they refrain
from a military solution
and think first before stnik-
ing a poor nation. Today
we have learned a lesson
how the loss of human life
is equally painful for the
nich, poor. strong or weak.
1 sympathise with those
who lost their family
members and loved ones.
