| You can't call your Union a ‘truly

Christian body’ when it stated that

“we have no political prisoners, no
state ofemergency. We have the right
of assembly and freedom of speech’’.

Against thisbackground your Union
proved itself anti-Christian and
anti-humaneness.

Today we live under the ungodly

‘truly Christian body’ stated that
‘human rights are being carried out

should not hire political priests to
