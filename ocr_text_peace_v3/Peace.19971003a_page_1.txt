Garoeb, History & Human Rights

BECAUSE ot the high regard the BWS (Breaking the Wall of
Stlence) has for family of the late Moses Garoeb, we decided
to reserve our comment on his life until after the funeral.
Garocb was given a full state funeral with a 21-gun salute.
preceded by a public holiday. Flags Nlew at half mast for& days.
A memonal service was held at Parliament Gardens. BWS
followed the events with great interest.

History has a special place for any person who has been given

a special responsibility ata given time. The yardstick being
used is how that person has related to human nights. Garoeb
was given a key position of administrative secretary of Swapo
in exile, which he occupied for 18 years. The Period between
1977 and 1989 can best be described as the cra of terror and fear
amongst Namibians in exile. Upon his return to Namibia, he
was given a key position of Swapo Secretary General. When
Namibian history puts Garoeb in his proper place in its annals,
itwill seriously take the details of the two periods into account.

After all the nice words have been said and all formal
statements have had their day, the crucial question has sull to
be asked. “Where shall history rightfully place Moses Garoeb
when the whole truth is told of how Namibians have lived in
exile, particularly in Zambia and Angola, and when issues of
honesty and human rights are taken into account?”

Moses Garoeb was brutally frank and frankly brutal, contra-
dictory, a demagogue who sought fulfilment in hurting fecl-
ings and hate speeches. In 1977 during the so called Shipanga
Crisis in Zambia, Garoeb went to Mboroma concentration
camp and succeeded to lure hundreds of the dissident combat-
ants back to Swapo, many of whom had disappeared soon
thereafter. Under his administration Swapo had climinated
hundreds of its followers in Angola and kept others in the
dungeons without even the host Government suspecting any-
thing, let alone the international community. When the world
Lutherans had started to raise some probi

exemplary private life and Garoeb had not been a good role
model in this regard.

When the UN Resolution 435 was about to the implemented,
with the demand that both South Africa and Swapo should first
release their captives, Garoeb went quickly to Lubango, gath-
ered the detainces from the different dungeons and threatened
that if they would reveal that they were detained by Swapo,
Swapo would deal with them in Namibia. At the same occasion
he “promised” them that they would carry the stigma of being
called South African spics for the rest of their lives.

Last year when some Namibians had started to organise
themselves into BWS to bring into the open the dark side of our
independence struggle. Garocb called upon Swapo members
countrywide to prepare for “civil war”.

In hife Garoeb had carried a lot of secret information crucial
to BWS work. It scems he has gone to his grave with this
information locked up in his heart. For the sake of history, BWS
Ws cagerly interested to hear what Garoeb had said about the
whole detainee saga during his last days of life. BWS had
capected that he might invite some of the Lubango dungeon
survivors to his sick bed but this seems not to have happened.

We all know that it was a gross political blunder and sheer
shortsightedness when last year Garoeb tried to publicly belittle
the Council of Churches in Nanubia. IUwas really moving to sec
that during the funeral service his body was consecrated and
committed back to dust by the man he once so scormfully
characterised as a“ non-entity”. However. inthe context of truth,
reconcthation and peace. Garocb had Icft us with a very impor-
tant theological question: “What will you do if f tell you that I
had killed your brother?” He asked this question last year when
he was addressing the striking workers in Okahandja. In ¢es-

sence, Garoeb was asking, “What will happen if Namibia is
exposed to the harsh truth regarding Swapo atrocities in exile?”
BWS' answer to this question is that truth, repentance, confes-
sion and restitution are the only sure foundation for genuine
reconciliation and durable peace.
BWS wishes Garoeb’s soul will rest in eternal peace!
