Nam Needs To Develop 4
National Consciousness (

NATIONAL consciousness transforms the pre
political, societal and cultural system and we have ,
the power and right to make of it what we Wish 4
Such a major understanding can only be realised in,
an atmosphere where people are convinced of the -
truth and it is inherent in their stand, ,

The exploitative attitude of Colonisers has !
throughout history resulted in nothing Sinis-
ter than mere cultural or geographical fusion at
worst, or language bastardisation at best. It ig true
that the history of weaker nations are Shaped by
those of larger nations. On the other hand,
weaker nations continue to be exploited and subse.
quently many independent African Nations fail to
attain real independence. The most important
weapon for this is our mind. People are becoming
more and more conscious of the self.

National Consciousness and its Spread in Namibia
has to work against a number of factors. Firstly,
there are the traditional complexities and then the
emptiness of the native’s past.

As Fanon puts it, “The consciousness of the self
is not the closing of a door to communication”,
National consciousness, which is not nationalism,
is the only thing that will give us an international
dimension.

Namibia must unite to foster peace and h
in our country. We should not divide because of
our differences, but appreciate them and build og
the diversity of our culture. Our youth especially
Should accept their responsibility towards each othy
and our society as a whole and. not dwell on the -
wrongs of the colonial era. This will only prove a
hindrance to our Progress towards peace, prosper-
ity and a sane society. We need to give democracy
and reconciliation a chance. If we do not reorientate
ourselves the idea of reconciliation will Surely fail.
