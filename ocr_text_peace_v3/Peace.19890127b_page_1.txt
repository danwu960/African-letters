I invite Mr Kandew and his
colleagnes in Swapo to abandon
their pretence and elitist altitudes
and to join hands with their fel-
low Namibians in building the
sort of country of which we can
all be proud. Swapo should re-
lease the detainees it is holding
without trial); stop the atrocities
in its camps and show that it is
interested in giving effect to the
goal of ‘one Namibia, one na-
tion’.

Delaying tactic

ALLOW me a space in the
peop!’s paper to query the irre-
sponsible activities of the supec-

ers, mainly the United States.

First of all they linked the
Namibian peace process to the
withdrawal of Cuban oops from
Angola; now they want to link the
number of Untag troops and offi-
cials with the negotiations. The
clarify the second point, | wish lo
state that the Americans are the
ones who have the money; they
are the ones who have to pay for
the implementation of Resolu-
tion 435.

Now the US have another cx-
cuse: they say that they can only
afford R100 million or the equiva-
tent in Dollars. This means that
the Untag component has to be
reduced. If they have to pay the
full amount (for Untag) then they
will demand that the Angolan
Governmem iate with Unita.
George Bush claimed to have
brought poaco to Africa (with his

, Reagan), so what |s

on? -
| w can 3000 (Untag) troops
it over 60.000 (Sovth A fri-
a. Namibia's
be linked to the

n af Unita in the |

Angolan government? It appears

to me that the Americans want .

war, They are the ones continu-
ing with their CIA to support Unita.
They are the ones who declared
the ANC a terrorist movement,
they are the ones which attacked
the MiG 23's of Libya; they are
the ones who don't want the Pal-
estinians to negotiate with the
Israclis.

If they want to reduce the number
of Untag troops, then they must

change Resolution 435, because: —

Resolution 435 says that 7500
Untag troops will arrive in’ Na-
mibia to supervise the elections;
Resolution 435 does not stipulate
that the Angolan Government must
negotiate with Unita; and in Reso-
lution 435 there is no such thing
that Untag troops must be com-
bined with the Koevoet or the
police.

If they wantto contradict Reso-
lution 435, then they must refor-
mulate it.

Reply to Matijila

IN your first issue for 1989, Mr
Matjila is reported as having
indignantly repudiated, on behalf
of the nation, an ECOSOC Com-
mission finding that the situation
of Namibian women necds ur-
gentattention. More specifically,
he declares himself satisfied with
the manner in which violence
against women is handled by law
enforcement agencies and the

courts.
