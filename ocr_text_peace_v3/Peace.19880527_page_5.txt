Our organisation, NPP 435, does not

advocate only the implementation of
Res 435, but propogatesthe real isation
of the Peace Plan(asourname implies),
which isentailedinthe comprehensive
set of supplementary agreements, the
most recent one being the agreement
on proportional representation
(Security Council Document S/17658
of November 26, 1985) which inex.
tricably form part of Res 435. In doing
80, we do not believe that we have abus-

ed the trust ofthe Namibian people, as
Prof Heywood seems to imply in the |
conclusion to her letter. Indeed,

evidence of our good faith may be found
in the fact that full copies of all the

Resolutions and documents to which
we have referred, as well as others, may
be consulted in the appendix to our
book, “The Choice! Namibia Peace
Plan 435 or Society Under Siege!” This
book is available to the public, via
bookshops and through our office(PO
Box 159, Windhoek, telephone:
226912, or at Room 304, Nimrod

Building, Casino Street, Windhoek).
