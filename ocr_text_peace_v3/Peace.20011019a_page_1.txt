Going To War To Create Peace?

FOR those of us fortunate to be living our lives a
considerable distance away from the war in Af-
ghanistan, there is a certain trony present in the

ents of the past week. Plainly put, is it possible

_istify the creation of peace by going to war?

here must be casualties in any war no matter the

ccautions taken to minimise collateral damage,
und the inevitable loss of life.

There is talk of a humanitarian catastrophe of
immense proportions because of the fallout from
hostilities combined with the ravages of a crip-
pling drought in Afghanistan. There are sugges-
tions that food drops will not adequately address
the situation. Women and children ure being
maimed in these punitive strtkes despite denials by
the US. and the western world seems united that
this 3s the way to fight terrorism,

The barbarity of the Middle Ages is with us right
now, except that death and destruction is being
dispensed at the press of a button in the clinical
surrounds of control-raoms thousands of nules
away. If Osama Bin Laden was the real target, then
real soldiers. with real courage should have been
sent to his lair, to seck him out. There would hardly
have been any collateral damage or civilian casu-
alties. But America has no longer got the nerve for
real combat. Instead it conducts war games with
*play-stationsâ€™.

Waging war is no way to fight terrorism! Bomb-
ing civilians and then trying to win their support
with food parcels is anything but civilized in
anyone's language! If the total cost of the hard-
ware, the munitions and the personne! committed
to the conflict were quantified, then much more
would have been achieved by spending that kind
of money on programmes to win the minds and
hearts of the Muslim world in a tangible and
meaningful way.

At the moment the Muslim world is being in-
censed to the point that the gains the US are hoping
to make, will be transformed into even more anti-
American sentiments. We have seen how these
simmering feelings of alienation have manifested
themselves on 11 September, 2001.

The world does not need more of the same, and
the present American campaign will merely re-
duce Afghanistan to rubble. The result will then
be that they (USA) will fund reconstruction un-
der a government of their liking, anul new feel-
ings of alienation fead to yet another generation
of hostilities. because the US fistens to no one but
itself.

Like the Roman Empire, the USA will, indeed.
must, implode us a world power. because of its
outward-looking tendencies. Finding faultoutside
its boundaries, tailing to engage i any introspec-
von, and gradually moving towards a society ham-
strung by curbs on the very freedoms that tts
claims to champion, will lead to its own destruc-
tion. The signs ure already there.

The problem is that America does not see itself
to blame for anything in the world to-day. Its
people. despite a reasonably powerful media, are
largely ignorant of what ts done in their name and
in their interests, and the administration, with is
bullying and arrogant attitude, sees itself as the
kings of the world, unchallenged by anyone since
the demise of the Soviet Union, as the balancing
power in the world.

I do not wish any harm to the American people,
despite their misguided attitudes to peaceful co-
existence in a world gradually falling under the
thrall of American power. but no one can avoid
what it brings upon itself, and therein lies the pity.
