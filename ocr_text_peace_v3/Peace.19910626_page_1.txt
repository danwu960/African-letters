DTA in Opuwo

WE Opuwo inhabitants are sick
and tired of the megaphone of
the DTA which makes unnec-
casary ocase, both day and night.

Wehavea school
here and our students are busy
with exams. We also have a
hospital where our patients are
lying trying to get rest while
they get treatment. We work-
ers of the Government also
need our rest after a long day's
work.

Bet DTA members apper-
ently don't think about the futuse
leaders of tomorrow, or their
stadies. They don't reepect the

to stop these activities and give

Water tariffs

D like to air my views
8 in the

Iwg
Tens
Whoever is ponmble niust
be asked abogit the provision
of water at bigh tariffs in this
area. I cannt understand why
Caprivi, which jsem the banks
of the bef: River, must be
ove ged for water.

The Zambezi f less than a
kilometre awayffrom Katima,
yet we pay lage amounts of
moncy from fomething that
could even bd fetched directly
from the sougce.

Because We liyéin ademo-
cratic state, Behave tofact ina
democratic manner /and the
Government must/meet the
demands of its pefple.

We pay 58 cegfts a litre and
that 1s too mucl¥. Some of usin.
the Ministry Af Works cam
only about 490 per month
and we cgh afford the high

water tanfh peril also find
that the people of thif area owe
alot of monsy with fheir water
accounts in arreary,

I would ome it if the
relevant Ministries could come
to Caprivi and spe the lists of

people who ows the Govermn-

ment. In the c ora, We
peid a fixed price of RS per
mooth for wa R10 for
the house. Why Can't the now
government do the in an

independent Nasaibia?
