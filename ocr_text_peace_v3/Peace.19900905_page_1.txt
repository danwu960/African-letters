Thanks to Angola

DEAR friends from Angola —

It has taken me quite a long time to
think of how to thank you for the
good things you have done for Namibia
. the list of all your assistance is too
long to include here.

How do I thank someone who has

shared a trench with me? I have no
descriptive words lo ¢xpross my
gratitude and appreciation for what
Angola has done for Namibia. I know
that the price Angola has paid for our
independence is higher and I am sure
that it cannot be measured in either
gold or money. The people of Angola
and their socio-economic infrastruc-
tures were the daily targets of the
apartheid regime and its mercenar-
ies.

However, today we are the victors!
The precious blood of the Namibian
and Angolan daughters and sons has
crowned our struggle with freedom
and justice. I am aware of He fact
that our enemies are still v-Arking
clay and night to destabilise our peace,
happiness and fratemal comradeship
and, therefore, there is still a need for
Vigilance at all times.

[believe that Angola and Namibia
can work together in order to bring
peace and stability to our beautiful
region of southern Africa.

I would like also to thank my friends
and comrades in Angola, especially
those who shared trenches with the
Plan combatants in the just struggle
against colonialism and all forms of

‘ Oppression in Namibia. [particularly
wam to thank the President of the
MPLA. Republic of Angola and the
His Excellency, Jose Edu-
ardo dos Santos and the entire leader-
he the MPLA. ee

ne same vein, I would Hike
_ thank my colleagues of the IMPLA
_ Who assisted me and my comrades of
__ te Swapo Youth League on qumer-
yh Rasions, Pashape iriculifatrto
