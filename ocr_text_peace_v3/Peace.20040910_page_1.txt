The People Must Nominate

AS a peace loving Na-
mibian, I would like to
give my opinion on our
democracy.

] would like to start
with giving my advice and
views to our democrati-
cally elected representa-
tives those are going to
be nominated and those
who are representing us
now, more especially
members of parliament
(National Assembly and
National Council). Some
of our representatives do
not truly represent us,
because we, citizens often

do not nominate them in
the first place. They are
representing their respec-
tive political party leader-
ship. Representatives who
have been so nominated by
their leaders, once elected
to office as parliamen-
tarians and councillors,
become subservient to
these leaders. Instead of
this representative being
accountable to the voters
they are only responsible
and accountable to their
political leaders who nom-
inated them, and who also
have the power to remove

them. Therefore such
representatives strive to
please their leaders often
in patron-client relation-
ships. Such relationships
are often maintained at the
expense of the voters and
the general public. This is
why once in their office,
most parliamentarians
and councillors may not
do what the public expects
them to do.

I know that these rep-
resentatives are not really
representing us because
citizens are not the ones
who nominate them.

What I want toemphasis
is that: I can see that the
top-down appointment
of candidates is not a
good way to go. Voters
have to nominate their
own representatives. Such
representatives nominated
by the voters themselves
know the needs of citi-
zens better than imposed
candidates do. Voters also
nominate a person who
they know and who they
trust. This system of the
top-down fashion of nomi-
nation must be stopped
and bottom- up fashion
must be introduced in the
political parties. I know
if we do this, our country

will be a good example to
other countries. Further-
more our representatives
will be accountable to all
citizens. The representa-
trves nominated by voters
themselves will work in
the interest of their voters
and not in interest of their
political leaders, because
they know that if they
do not work in the inter-
est of their voters in the
next election they will be
kicked out. I wrote this
letter because I know that
we as citizens really need
to be represented.
