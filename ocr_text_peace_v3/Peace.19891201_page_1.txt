No defence force? :

AN advertisement placed in this |
newspaper by the Director of the As-
sociation for the Handicapped in
Namibia provoked my attention. Il
states: ‘Let Namibia not start a de-
fence force ... let Namibia start a
development force’.

I appreciate the fact that the Direc-
tor wishes this country well in terms
of the fact that he wants to ‘save
lives, prevent disability, develop
Namibia, and above all, obey God's —
will’. However, I do not agree with
the idea that in order for our country
to develop we should not have a
defence force.

Sure ‘Namibia has impressed the
world with the first-ever democratic
election in Africa’, but let us not be
naive and unrealistic by being blind
to the possible destabilising forces
that surround our country. To those —
whose normal lives are continually
disrupted by Unita bandits in the |
north: to those who are well aware of
South Africa's tendencies to go on
the rampage on adventures in neigh-
bouring countries, the idea of Na-

mibis being 4 Goattioriond zone is
ly unacceptabtc, presance
