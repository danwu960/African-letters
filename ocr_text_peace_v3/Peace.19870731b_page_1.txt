ALLOW ME to respond to the letter
_ | published in The Namibia of July 10,
entitled ‘Coward Lister’.

First ] would like to inform Mr
Mungunda and his Union that Lister
| is afairand honest editor. The weekly
paper, The Namibian, is presenting

| the true facts of what is happening in

this country. The Namibian is the on-
ly real newspaper in Namibia which
prints the truth about the country.

Lister did not berate and insult the
Hereros as you alleged. The paper
| revealed to the public the ungodly
| work of the Nudo members. It 1s self-
evident that Nudo members and their
‘bishops’ are South African proxies,
who are used by the colonial govern.
| ment to disrupt meetings of pro-
| gressive forces and character-
lassassinate Swapo members and
supporters,
| Donot migjudge Lister or accuse her

falsely. We the public know of your dir-
ty tricks.

Worst of all, you claimed that your
Union(Namibian Churches Unionjis —
a ‘truly Christian body’. Your letter |
had nice terminology but lacked reali- |
ty and is confronted with countless |
| dilemmas. OT i

Your letter covered the true core |
