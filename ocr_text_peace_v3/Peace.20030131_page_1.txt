Give Peace A Chance |

AS we all know the US and its associ-
ates are preparing for the largest and
most expensive offensive which the
world has ever witnessed. This offen-
sive is aimed against the vulnerable 1.¢.
the children and other innocent vicums,
while the main culpnts are at large as
usual. The US hunt for Bin Laden has
proven unsuccessful so far.

I don’t condone terrorism or any other
associated barbaric act against the inno-
cent. Neither should chaos be the order of
the day in apprehending those suspects.
We are inacivilized world where the rule
of law is preserved. That's why we have
a recognised body (UN) which is sup-
posed to ensure that peace and tranquil-
lity prevails on this planet; and among

others to sanction any military acton
against those threatening world peace.
Lam, however, puzzled and very con-
cemed about the massive military build
up in the Gulf. It has been reported that
the US intelligence are in possession of

evidence to prove that Saddam has weap-

UN or other big nations like France,
Russia, Germany or China. Weapons
inspectors confirmed that no weapons of
mass destruction had been discovered so
far.

But the US then says Saddam is not
co-operating with them, and he must do
more. If Saddam lied or is still conceal-
ing something, then most certainly he
will face the full consequences thereof.

The weapons inspectors have asked
for more time and Bush sull has to wait
till the end of the year. If the US is really
concemed about the situation why not

with the arms inspectors by
providing them with exact details of the
alleged weapons. These arms inspector
can then take the appropriate steps as
mandated in their mission. This will
make the task easier for them. Why
would you waste billions and billions
and behave like an unruly kid by taking
the law into your owD hands? C'mon,

give peace a chance.
