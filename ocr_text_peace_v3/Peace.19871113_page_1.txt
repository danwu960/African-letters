Mortality formula

IN THE wake of the latest SADF incur-
sions into Angola and the claims by
Magnus Malan about Swapo's loss of
150 men totheir 12, onecould pose the
following questions:
CJ Did Magnus Malan get his mortali-
ty formula from the now infamous
oortrekker/Zulu war at Blood River?
O Ifthey (SADF)claim such a high suc-
cess rate, why then had Swaponot sur-
rendered during its first year of arm-
ed struggle (1966)?
0) Is Mr Malan’s cheap propaganda
aimed at those whoatill might jointhe
armed struggle? |
[] Has he read the recent copies ofThe
Namibian which indicate a rise in ter-
rorist activities by SADF and their
_ offspring?
_ Wecertainly don’t need your “protec-
tien”. Protection against whom?

Mr Malan, you might fool the pup-
pets you have installed here in Win-
dhoek, but certainly not the people of
Namibia whoseek peace and freedom.
