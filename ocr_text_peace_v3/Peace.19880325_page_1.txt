We hate the war

WE ARE tired of the war and longing:
for a free Namibia, where peace and
order, equality and self-determination,
will be the order of the day. |

How can Swapo be blamed in connec-
tion with the Oshakati bomb? J amone
of those who have lost family members
inthe Oshakati bomb blast, but Idonot
_ believe Swapo was responsible.
What we want is that the politically-
hungry Mr Moses Katjiuongua and
- Andreas Shipanga and others, stop
blaming Swapo for the Oshakati bomb.
And let them hear this.

We don't hate anyone; what we hate
isthe war which is among us; and what
we want is for the war tocometoanend
and the implementation of 435 now.
