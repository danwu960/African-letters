Were The Elections Free And Fair?

ELECTIONS would be fair if those who vote elected
their representatives freely without any pressure or
any form of intimidation or character assassination?
I strongly feel that (the Swapo Congress) elections
were not free and fair.

The sacking of our visionary, capable Hamutenya
just before elections and smear campaigns against
him by Nujoma on several occasions will never
make this election free and fair.

I would not expect any rational person to believe
what has been said about Hamutenya by those who
did so, including the President.

We expected the President to tell the nation and
the Congress in particular that these are tested
comrades and the everybody should make his/her
own choice accordingly.

He is now claiming that the Congress has voted
in the interest of the whole nation. This is totally
wrong. The congress has voted for Nujoma’s un-
known interests.

If the entire nation was afforded a chance to
elect, I think the results could have been different.
The fact that Pohamba came with a pre-prepared
speech for the victory shows us that the results
were predetermined and the transparency used in
the counting processes is questionable.

We considered Sam Nujomaas the great founding
father of our nation and indeed a visionary leader

of Africa but this was not so. .Nujoma is increas-
ingly becoming a hardcore despot. He thinks he can
turn things around, ceteris paribus. Firing senior
ministers and indecd cabinet members who served
for decades is a big embarrassment to him and to
the public.

Does this mean Swapo party does not have inter-
nal disciplinary procedures to deal with unfounded
defaming allegations? He keeps on referring to
others as imperialists and forgets that he went to
the same imperialists to negotiate for Namibia’s
independence.

His prerogative is being seriously misused. Some
ministers are so much preferred that firing them
would destabilise the country’s peace and stability
and dissolve the gains of our hard-won independ-
ence. This is also a sign that Swapo is slowly but
surely disintegrating.

I think this was the wrong decision at the wrong
time. All the peace loving Namibians (perhaps ex-
cluding despots, opportunists, presidential remote
controls, political armatures, and power-hungry
hereby sympathise with Hamutenyaand his deputy.
We are already missing his intellectual leadership
which we always admired.
