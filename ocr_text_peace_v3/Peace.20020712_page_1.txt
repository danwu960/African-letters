The NBC did

ALLOW me a space in your
newspaper to express my con-
cems on the remarks made by
the Swapo Women’s Council
chief Eunice lipinge.

If my memory serves me well,

nnan

a good job

children by promoting the anti-
violence against women and chil-
dren campaign.

Mr Mwakembeu conducted

several workshops in many
schools in the country one of

on Wednesday July 3, 2002 in) which attended and he was mak-

your edition appeared the report
on the Swapo’s WomenCouncil.
In this report Ms lipinge took a
swipe at the NBC for featuring
men falsely accused and jailed
for rape, with a simple reason
that it will hinder the progress
made in tackling violence against
woman.

I was very much shocked to
see that our own Namibian
women who have been for quite
‘some time on the so called 50:50

Are the men not supposed to be
cleared of all the dirt brought upon
their names and social status?

In the case of Mr Mwakembeu

Inga noticeable impact on school-

boys and he was really prepanng

us (boys) to grow up into respon-
sible men who can live in peace
and harmony with women.

But the question stll remain
that, will the dedicated and com-
mitted Mr Mwakembeu be able to
continue to work for the social

wellbeing of all women and chil-
dren?

We are all aware of many rape
and other violence against women
related cases around the country,

-and we all call for seriogs punish-

mem for thoea convicted and
of the

7 charges against them, but in the

same manner, we should also ac-
cept the truth as it is, and must
definitely clear the names of al
the innocent men falsely accused
and jailed for rape. The
NBC has just done a good job.
