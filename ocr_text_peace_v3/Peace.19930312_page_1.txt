Who are heroes?
_ ONE difficult question

before Nemibians is who.

is to be called a Namib-
ian hero?

on a programme
called ‘Counter Point’
in 1992, and people were

also give the chance to

air their views on a Ta- |

dio chat show.

Some names were
mentioned of those
considered to be heroes,
like Chiefs Hendrik
Wilbooi, Mandume
Ndemufao, King Nehale
Mpingana, Jacob Mar-
enga, some mentioned
Frankie Fredericks and
others asked whether
German Govermor Leut-

wein should be a hero,
Or President Sam

Nujoma?

As far as 1 am con-
cerned this question still
needs an answer.

Before this issue was
debated I had already
some interest in the topic
and was trying to gather
information for an edu-
cation poster on heroes
of Namibia, which is still
pending, as the question
remains unresolved.

As a histonan I was
asked to idenufy Namib-
ian heroes, and the aim
of the poster 1s to help or
guide teachers at schools
as to how they could
include this topic in their
syllabus.
