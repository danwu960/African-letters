Chief and returnees

THERE are unbearable restmctions
impposed on Namibian returnces to
their homesteads and areas by cer-
tain tnbal chiefs. One of them is
Stefanus Comelius Weyulu in the
area of Kongo. He must remember
that the people he 1s restncting are
owners of the land he pretends to
own.

They are people who have struggled
for many years for change and peace
in this country, Kongo included.

You say you have no room in the
area for us. Your future resis on your
bad faith towards these people.

Also bear in mind the fact that the
notorious Koevoet squad and socal-
led home guards have been operating
in your area, so you had better change
your attitude.

We come beck to the land of our
birth, m which we were bom, not to
be colonised and intimidated again.
A misled person like yourself should
not prevent us from coming you, and
you are wasting your time by trying
to do 80.

Do not try and harm the recurnecs,
they are here for peace and not for
war. If you do not know what is
happening im the country now, thon
ask your more politically-conscious
friends or attend a Swapo rally and
learn that we are not hostile people.

You srast now reconcile with the
Js youhave offended, and do act

_ would advise you fo fpfd our from the

harvest the products of your labour,
and i1 is time for you to denounce
your former stance now. Tomorrow
may be too late.

Allow Namibians to exercise their
rights in the land of their birth and
stop recruiting Namibians as body-
guards and those who search homes
al night for returnees.

one of the most disorganyed organ-

As far as the spopSors of ASA are
concerned, let tell you again:
ASA is more opfanised that the NNSL
will in all ppsbebility.cxes-be and the
