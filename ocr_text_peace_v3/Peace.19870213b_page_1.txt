SA’s consent

I REFER to the letter: which ap-
peared in The Namibian of February
6 1987, written by Mr Clive Algar,
Rossing Uranium's public affairs
manager, accusing Swapo’s UN
representative, Mr Helmut Angula,
of making “extravagant statements’
about Rossing.

As I looked at Mr Clive Algar's let-
ter, I quickly realised that this was
& public relations officer painting a
good picture of his company.

First. and foremost 1 would like to
hear from Mr Algar who has
authorised Rossing to mine uranium
in Namibia. According to my sources,
this company was given a green light
by South Africa in 1970, four years
after the UN General Assembly
revoked South Africa's mandate to
rule Namibia. Was Rossing ignorant
of UN Decree Number 1 which clear-
ly states: “No person or entity,
whether a body corporate or uncor-
porate, may search for, take, extract,
mine, refine, use, sell, export or
distribute any natural resources
whether animal or mineral situation

. within the territorial limite of
Namibia without the consent of the
UN Council for Namibia”.
