Time To Pack Bags

THE following letter by NBC and Pacon Chairperson,
Uazuva Kaumbi, was sent to a staff member at The
Namibian, and copied to the Editor:

THANK you very much for your posi-
tive articles about our film project, espe-
cially your article in The Weekender of
today (September 28). I hope your boss,
Gwen, learns from you, because it ap-
pears that she does not know anything
about professional journalism. She,
Gwen, that is, is one of those White
liberals who must be taught that we as
Atricans are able and willing to do things
forourselves. Her personal fight with me
will soon backfire, and 1 am looking
forward to that day when she shall be-
come so embarrassed about the things
she lies about now that she will decide to
pack her bags and vo back to whence she
came. That will be good nddance to bad
influences. Is ita comcidence that all the

private dailies in Namibia are owned and
controlled by Whites? Gwen has been
editor-for-life of The Namibian! Why 1s
the editor of the The Namibian sull White,
as ts the News Editor? All of this eleven
years after independence! Makes you
think, doesn'tit? All of these realities are
part the challenges facing us as Pan
Africanists. Let us fight the good fight.
Welcome to the club, dearest sister.

We have just received some very inter-
esting video and audio tapes from
Africanist groups in the USA. I shall
invite you to the public screenings of
these videos. Keep up the good work.

Love and Peace.

Uazuva Kaumbi, WINDHOEK
