THE Church played a
vital role during the lib-
cration Struggle and
should continue with its
mission. The main ob-
jective is to bring the
message of salvation
across to the entire na-
tion and also to fulfil
God's Plan.

One wonders what the

¢ The Church should
not allow itsclf to be
used by the Government
as a puppet, but instead
be a body on its own
receiving its instructions

directly from above. The
Church, besides pro-
claiming the message of
salvation, should be able
to criticise and core!
the government wher-
ever ithas done wrong.
(Acts 4:19),

* The Church's mis-
sion is also to care for

the Nock and must give
account of that one lost
sheep at the final day.
The onc partof the body
cannot suffer without

The Church, after in-

gravy train and unncc-

even unable to feed its

luxuries.

On the fand issuc ...
The Church should
stand up and convince

Christ who own up to
five farms to practice the
Chnstian principles of
sharing and generosity.

If we claim that 90%
of the Namibian nation
are Christians let us

tighten our belts and al-
leviate poverty. hunger
and diseases ina practl-
cal fashion, This will
lead to a positive IM
pact on the crime rate
and employment.

Let us all say ‘no’ to
capitalism and live ac-
cording to the biblical
text af Acts 2:44 - 45,
Acts 4.32 which implore
all Christians to share
and live together in
peace as brothers and
sisters in Christ.
