Defending gains

ALLOW me to air my views on behalf
of many. I feel disappointed when I
| see follow former combatants who
are wandering around the streets of
Namibia’s cities and towns.

Being a former combatant myself,
I feel that we are all neglected and
forgotten by the Government that we
have fought for. We had no time to
eam a living in the past years, simply
because we were engaged in the armed
struggle for the liberation of Na-
mibia. The struggle has been long
and bitter, many of our brothers and
sisters have sacrificed their precious
lives for the liberation of our mother-
land, others are crippled for life.

Now that the struggle for political
independence is won, why is it still
continuing in cases like ours? We
suffered during the years of armed
struggle in the bush, but we still
continue to suffer, even after inde-
pendence, even worse than was the
case inthe bush. We have no jobs and
if one manages to get work, then
there is no roof over his or her head.

Our qualifications, which some of
us obtained abroad, are disregarded
by employers, yet most of us have
leamed at institutions in independent
countries where there is no segrega-
tion or racial discnmination.

In Namibia we are asked to pro-
vide the employers with Bantu Edu-
cation certificates which in my view
is nonsense.

It is really disappointing to leam
that most of the civil servants in our
Government offices are former
Koevoet members who were deliber-
ately put in certain positions by the

colonial regime. Many of these people .

do not possess a Standard 10 or col-
lege certificate like many of us do.
These people were merely employed
becanse of the colour of their skin
and they dominate in every workplace.

Letter

We have no chance anywhere. The
Government should seriously look
into our problem and do something
about it. We read in newspapers daily
that the enemy of peace, Unita, and
their collaborators are trying to cre-
ate conditions conducive for another _
war in our country. Yet the Govern-
meat does not want to allow all those
who are able-bodied former Plan
combatants to join the national army.
Are we ignoring the realities?

The enemy want destabilization
and poverty to take root here as has
occurred in Angola and Mozambique.
It is time to think twice and make
sure that the heroes and heroines who
fought for the liberation of this coun-
try should be at least fully integrated
into the police and national! army in
order to defend the gains of the revo-
lution against enemy encroachment.

We want to see the changes for
peace and independence of our people
maintained by the loyal men and
women we now see wandering around
without jobs. Reconciliation must
make things balance.

The Government must seo to it that
these brave men and women are
assisted by the stato, even if it means
creating a demobilization fund so
that they can make ends’ meet.
