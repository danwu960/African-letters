Not starving

I WOULD like to respond to a report
in the interim government propagan-
da mouthpiece of November 3, which
criticised church-run schools in the
territory.

Mr Andrew Matjila, Education
Minister, said that we were disad-
vantaged because we _ were
undernourished.

Church schools are contributing
much to our country, and our eyes
and minds are kept open in these
schools. We have a fair system of
education, and we feel at home.

Coming to Mr Matjila’s point that
we are locked into our hostels: this
is not true. Everyone has the right
to go home with the permission of
staff members, and this is a sign of
order. We are protected by the church
_ as future leaders of this country. .

Truly speaking, we are thankful for
the good we are getting. We eat in
order to survive and not to get fat as
he is doing. If he wants to make us
fat, then they have to implement a
system of equal education in this
country.

Mr Matjila should also not confuse
himself about Swapo and the Coun.
cil of Churches. They are using the
money for peaceful means, while he
and his colleagues have grabbed
possession of the country, including
the education system.

He and his colleagues spent a for-
tune on military training, while peo-
are dying. Leave church schools

q ° peace, for they are working for
