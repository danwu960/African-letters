US Foreign Policy Must
â€˜Answer For Terrible Tragedy

THE attack ontwo Ameri-
can cies js a terrorist act
of such magnitude that a
few words of condolence
hardly seem appropnate.
Nevertheless, our hearts
go outto the families who
have lost loved ones, and
the American people as a
whole.

This terrible act of ter-
tor highlights a number
of issues, which are dits-
turbing forall ofus living
in the free world. Whilst
we can never justify ter-
ror as a way of solving
problems, the signs point-
ing to this tragedy have
been around for some
time, and this tragedy
could have been avoided.

The premature fingers
of suspicion are pointing
at Osama Bin Laden as
the perpetrating master-
mind, There are many
other proups around the
world who have no love
for the American admin-
istration, and these acts
could have been com-
mitted by any ofa number
of organisauions, and not
allofthem of Arabic ori-
gin.

It must not be forgat-
tenthat Osama Bin Laden

isa creation of American
foreign policy, if there is
such an animal. Bin
Laden was aided and
abetted by America when
he was a member of the
Mujehadin when they
were fighting the Soviet
forces in Afghanistan.
Atthe ume he was act-
ing in the tnterest of
America, and being sup-
plied with weaponry.
Saddam Hussein is an-
other American creation
(read Schwarzkopt's au-
toblography) who was
supplied with weapons
and the very biologtcal
gases that they now want
toconfiscate. These were
used by frag against lran
inthe eight year war be-
tween these (wo coun-
tries. The same guses
were used in Vietnam. It
must be remembered that
both Bin-Laden and
Saddam Hussein are Ar-
abs. and America has
made it patently clear
that it has no interest in
the Arab world. its peo-
ple. or its progress.
America acts only in its
own interest. hence the
military base in Qatar.
It is unashamedly pro-

Israel (read pro-Jew-
ish).

No country, which
postures as a world
power, can broker peace
in the Middle East if it
displays the kind of bias
that America does in the
that region. There was a
time when we merely
suspected that there was
this pro-Israeli bias, now
everyone on the street
knows it, and what does
that do for the integrity of
American diplomacy in
the world?

The Middle East con-
flict could have been re-
solved many years ago if
America had not been a
biased peace broker, but
the Jewish intluence in
Congress and American
society generally, made
that tmpossible. Also.
American foreign policy
is NOL something that 1s
clearly defined. It ts, in
fact, and ad hoc arrange-
ment, which flins with
the devil at the best of
times. The results are
now clear to see. Puni-
tive strikes against the
perpetrators wall also
achieve very litle.

Everything that has

tragically come to pass
over the last few days is
symptomatic of the man-
ner in which the Ameri-
can administration goes
about its business.

It ts sad and tragic that
Innocent Americans
have had to pay sodearly
for an administration,
which has let them and
the world down so badly.
Itis also indicative of the
fact that world powers
no longer stand on prin-
ciple when dealing with
issues. Instead compro-
mise ts the standard and
ethics and morality 1s
being so rapidly eroded
that we no longer stand
up for our rights as equal
occupants of the planet.
America would do well
to look at why it was
targeted in this terrible
act of terrorism. It can
ensure that this never
happens again. and I
hope that tts energies will
be used in the areas
where they matter most.
My condolences to all
atfected by this terrible
tragedy.
