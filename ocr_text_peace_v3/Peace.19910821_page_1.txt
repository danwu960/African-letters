Chief's tribalism

I WOULD like to refer to the
socalled revelations by Chief
Mamili published in The
Namibian entitled ‘The Mafwe
state their case’ on August 31.

If this revelation comes from
the Cinef himself then all peace
and freedom-loving Namibi-
ans should without hesitation
declare him the 1991 cham-
pion of tnbalism - for it ap-
pears he is unable to think
beyond the tnbe.

The point I would like to
make to Chief Mamuli and a
small section of the Mafwe
surrounding him 1s that the
cheapest colonisation method
used to colonise Namibia was
through the existence of tribes
- the championing of one tnbe
at the expense of others so as to
smoothly pave the way for the
bantustanisation of Namibia.

It is disappointing to leam
that Chief Mamili claims Ka-

tima Mulilo is a Mafwe area.

Capnvi knew no boundaries
even in the time of the coloni-
alists.

Why should we talk of tnbal
divisions and tribal bounda-
ries at this time? What are we
going to benefit from tribal
conflicts apart from rolling back
the progressive idea of national
reconciliation the ruling party
is keen to implement in order
to mould a healthy and pros-

_ perous nation?
