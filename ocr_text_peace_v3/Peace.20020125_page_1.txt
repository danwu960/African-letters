To Eat Promptly, And In Peace

EVERY once in a while, one would like to share experi-
ences and happenings with other people, in order to either
prevent them experiencing the same. of to hopefully shed
hight on the goings-on at certain eateries in Windhoek. I
would like to share one such expenence with readers, and
hope that this will have some kind of (positive) impact.
We all like to slip away from office dunng our lunch
hours (usually between | and 2) and grab something small
to eat, preferably in pleasant company, and in pleasant
surroundings if possible. Now for clear reasons, I shall not
name the little comer amongst birds and trees, created ina
backyard-garden like atmosphere, where I decided to take
a female friend to lunch for a chat over some usually good

takes at most 10 minutes!

Eventually food was served at 13h40. After ealing as fast

were going to be late for both our jobs. After waiting at
another 5 minutes, now sli ghuy annoyed, I decided toleg

of being ill mannered, and guilty of theft, with no intentiog
of resolving the matter from my side...

Occurrences like these seriously hamper the enjoymen
of the public, and thus | am inviting the editor and the
readers to comment on such instances. and let us try to
resolve these problems. After all - what we as consumer,
want is some quiet place to sit and enjoy our lunch, ng
