WE ARE eamestly await-
ing the birth of the prom-
ised cnild. Almost five
ycars have passed since tbe
arrival of the propbet Ellen
Mrsialela, who promised
Swapo that she would work
constantly to unite all the
misled Mafae people and
the Linyanti Khuta dehind
Swapo because she would
politically destroy Mishake
Muyongo, her former hus-
bad. Five years later, she
has managed bo push them
asunder and is now accus-
ing the Masubia people for
her failuce. Why?

The letter ‘Putting
Caprivi conflicts in per-
spective’, New Bra, April
28-May &, is a total expo-
sure and revelation of the

slanderous and malicious
language towards fellow

The Katima Mulilocon-
stituency which was won
by DTA over Swapo by
600 votes is attributed first
and foremost to Musialela
who was sent to be an or-
ganiser for the  Fegion but
ended up con

or Sibbida constituencies.
She was first beaten in
Katima by the late Cde

1 would like to pose the
following quesucns to Mr
Mukaloto:

* why do you cherish
the idea that the DTA won
ihe most votes in the 1992
efections if at all you area
Swapo cadre?

* why do you fail to
organise and conduct a
Swapo meeting in your
strong area. Linyanti?

* why don't you spare

condemn the destructive
