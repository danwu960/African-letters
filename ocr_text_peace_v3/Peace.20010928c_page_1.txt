The Terror Of Fireworks

] DON'T care if Dr Vic-
tor was at Independence
Stadium on September
22. What I do care about
is the fireworks that were
are part of his concert.

For those residents who
live in the area surround-
ing the stadium, their
peaceful Saturday night
was destroyed. At first
the fireworks sounded
like gunfire right next
door. That is enough to
give anyone a heart at-
tack (I hate to think about
anyone who does have
heart problems).

The “gunfire” contin-
ued and we did not dare

venture outside because
we thought there was a
full-blown gunfight hap-
pening. After a few min-
ules we realised that the
“shots” were too consist-
ent, and then we realised
that it must be fireworks
from the stadium. By that
time our dogs and the
dogs all around us were
in an absolute state of ter-
rorand barking the neigh-
bourhoods down. For
those of you who don’t
know, loud noises are
extremely disturbing
(never mind cruel) for
dogs. It would have been
good manners for those

organising the Dr Victor
concert to inform the resi-
dents around the stadium
that there would be fire-
works on Saturday. Then
we could prepare and buy
tranquillisers for our-
selves and for our pets.
But it would have been
even better if there were
NO fireworks at all.

Can‘tthe Municipality
do something about this?
Anyway, isn't there
something in the law
about “disturbing the
peace”.
