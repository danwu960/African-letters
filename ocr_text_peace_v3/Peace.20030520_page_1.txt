Stop Rape And Violence

MANY more young people are becom-
ing violent in their relationships. Some
of them brutally kill their partners. Is
that love? Love is not violent and vio-
lence is wrong. In Namibia there are
many cases of partners killing one an-
other, because one partner tned to ter-
minated the relationship.

I would like to express my condo-
lences to the three young women Minam
Ndakumininwa Haindongo, Susan
Nangula Ikela and Ipula Akwenye who
were brutally murdered by their part-
nets.

Women should be allowed freedom
of movement and speech and to do what
they want, think is the best and what
they need. Today we are enjoying peace
and stability under the spirit of national
reconciliation. Men should stop mur-
dering women and raping children on a
daily basis.

Women are our mothers and sisters.

They need to be given love. care and
protection against all form of viobence
and abuse. Violence against women and
children is widespread in Namibia Some
young men forced their parmers into
sexual slavery. Is that love? But love is
not pain or violence. The death of even
one woman in Namibia in this manner 1s
unacceptable.

Let us respect their quahty and dig-
nity. Let us show our comradeship and
solidanity as young people of Namibia to
oppose this villainous behavior.

\ would also appeal to the law enforce-
ment authonties to take drasnc actoa
against perpetrators of such crimes.

Where are we heading with this iad of

to stand up against these berbanc crime-
nals.
