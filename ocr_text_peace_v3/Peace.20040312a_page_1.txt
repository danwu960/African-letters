When Is Enough, Enough?

IS Namibia a “cry baby” nation that
cannot concede defeat or is itindeed
a “banana” republic that cannot
respect its own laws, letalone a High
Court ruling and interational treaties
we are signatory to.

Namibia's prosecution team has
been beaten twice on the high eason
drama - it goes with the saying: once
beaten twice shy. When is enough,
enough?

Why is the prosecution team so
determined to find success where
it’s non-existent?

Is ita question of ego or conscience
that they are so afraid to let Capnivian
treason suspects walk free, as has
been ordered by Namibia’s High
Coun?

Petitioning the Chief Justice is
well and good, but what more if
permission is denied, based on a
clear rundown by Judge Hoff of the

pros and cons of such a scenario. A
clear assessment has been made by
Judge Hoff, which cannot easily be
beaten by the prosecution team.

How could even Botswana
consider the Namibian
Government's appeal for the
extradition of Namibians that were
needed to return and stand trial -
when they would have to deal with
such a messed-up legal system?
Who, as of now, can take Namibia
seriously?

The continuous postponement
and detention without trial of
Caprivian treason suspects,
stretching up to 5 years now, is
shattering - mentally, physically and
emotionally - as well as an obstacle
to nation-building.

Have we forgotten as well that
we are dealing with human life?

If this drama and mockery of

Justice is not stopped immediately -
it will only breed more hate and
disunity amongst people. It is a
time bomb that is bound to bring
irreparable and highly regrettable
consequences if not contained by
Namibia's leadership - churches,
humanitarian groups and political
parties.

It’s not too late to spearhead the
notion of peace and reconciliation -
Namibia needs it.
