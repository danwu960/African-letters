Right Wing Afrikaners, Take Note!

Noval with shock and dismay in The Namibian of
; about the activities of the so called
Boer nation warriors’. I want to express my views.

I do not know whether the “boerevolk krygers”
elements are also present in Namibia, but if there are
such members or those who are aspiring to such
ideas, keep such ideas dormant infinitely. It is
friendly advice.

I am very concerned about this terrorist move-
ment causing havoc in South Africa with its result-
ant destruction and disregard for human life and
property. This movement, although it has been in
existence for years, has surely come at the wrong
time. Those conservative, radical boers:
that they do not live in Utopia whereby
promote the ideology of Aryan nationalism. They
must learn to live with diversity. We are all people
of different colours and that we have to live side by
side. No one is superior or inferior to the other. To
be bad is not an inherent character, it is a learned

habit due to the environment in which one is raised.
Anyone can be bad.

Criminality is not confined toa specific race. No!
Itis part of human existence and under certain social

potential cnminal.
This reminds me of what Mr Hannes Smith (edi-

tor of Windhoek Observer) once wrote. | quote: “No
man/woman is bom a criminal. Criminals are made
by conditions, environmental factors, to Say noth-
ing of social conditions”. How true are those words
from an open-minded person.

Those who are aiming to wipe out the black nation
(in case of Soweto) must know that the black man
can act io the same way. Does it sound inciteful or
a threat to you? Maybe, but not to me. Together we
can make or break this world.

Nine bombs in all were enough to take away many

lives.
n one’s livelihood is threatened, you invent

ways to counteract in order to protect yourself to
survive. Let us live in peace rather than war. War 1s
bad so let us avoid racial hatred since we did not
choose who we are. Let us find lasung pragmatic
solutions that would see us through to the next
development level. Life was meant to be lived by

all. No one has a patent on life.
