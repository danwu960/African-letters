Fears for March
21

WE, the people of the far north of
Namibia are afraid of what might happen
on the day of independence for Namibia.

The rumours are doing the rounds by
ex-members of 101 and Koevoet while
they are under the influence of alcohol that
mobs will attack civilians on March 21.
One wonders whether there are still weap-
ons hidden in the area or not.

To assure our safety on that day, we
request the Administrator General and the
Chief of Police and UN Special Represen-
tative to conduct searches in the area for
possible weapons caches.

We are now familiar with these people
who are talking freely and without fear in
our presence. Because we love and want
peace, this gives them good reason not to
fear us.

I can assure the leaders of independent
Namibia that there are many more weap-
ons caches in areas of the north. The nation
wants peace and they donâ€™t want lo go
back to war again.
