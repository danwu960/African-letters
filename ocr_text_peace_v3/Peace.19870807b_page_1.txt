Who's killing?

Please allow me tosay something in
the newspaper which does not conceal
the truth.

On 22-7-1987, the chairman of a
parliamentary group in London, Mr
Nicolas Winterton, spoke over the col-
onial Radio Owambo, and expressed
dissatisfaction with the bomb explo-
sion in Windhoek afew weeks ago. He
said that the Swapo office in London
should be closed down because that
organization did a bad thing by plan-
ting the bomb.

Mr Winterton I want to know
whether you have certainty that the
bomb was in fact planted by Swapo.
Real proof is what I need.

Mr Winterton, you say that you'are
are feeling bad about the bomb in
which no one lost their lives, and
already you want the office of
Namibia’s true freedom fighters to be
closed down. A real pity.

In the meanwhile you ignore the
despicable misdeeds which are being
committed by South Africa. For exam-
ple, Mrs Alina Shilongo’s house which
was destroyed by South Africa’s
Casspirs on 3-7-1987. That was the
house of an aged woman of 80 years.
Should it have been your grandmoyuer,
what would you say?. Give an anver
to that. Of course you are not feeling
any disquiet because her skin is
black.

Winterton, neither you nor South
Africa’s apartheid is wanted here in
Namibia.

You must be happy about what your
friend, South Africa, has done by
shooting and killing an innocent
schoolgirl. (Laina Taapopi, 8-7-1987).

And now you are saying that Swapo
has committed a misdeed, and its of-
fices in London should be closed.

In that case, would you ask that
South A frica’s ‘offices’ be closed down
in Namibia? Should they close because
of what is happening here? Or is your
boss South PARrie
Namibia? re

Winterton, when you say that you

a doing good in:
