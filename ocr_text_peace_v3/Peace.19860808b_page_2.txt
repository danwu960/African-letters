_ President Reagan and his
_ followers should know that sanc-
tions against South Africa means
alot to us: He should know that
the key to the liberation of this
country lies in his hands. He must
drop his capitalistic ideas and
negotiate with the South African
- Government in order to accelerate
the implement of Resolution 435.
South Africa and its puppets
should know that as long as there
is no free election in this country,
there will be no unity or peace here.
South Africa should also stop its
interference in Angolan matters
and withdraw its forces from
_ Angolan and Namibian soil.

I would like to tell our brothers
that we should stop killing and
_ discriminating against one another
_ and unite in order to » ficilicate the
_ Boal of freedom. ae
