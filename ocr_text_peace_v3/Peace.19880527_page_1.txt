Reply te Heywood
WE note the letter from Professor A
Heywood, published in your —
newspaper on May 20,1988,in which ©
she differs with certain statements
made in an advertisement which was
placed by NPP 435 in the Windhoek
Observer. We would like to respond to
the three major points which she has
raised in her letter:
1) On the question of whether or not
Resolution 435 provides for elections
under joint South African and United
Nations (UN) supervision: Prof
Heywood is quite correct in stating
that ‘‘Resolution 435 and the
documents surrounding it are reflec-
tions of historical reality”. Your cor-
respondent correctly points out that
Resolution 385 (which preceded
Resolution 435 by tlwo-and-a-half
years) declares that free elections be
held under supervision and control of
the UN. However, in order to give effect
to Resolution 385, the Western Five
negotiated a settlement plan for
Namibia with South Africa and
Swapo, which culminated in the
Western Proposal for Settlement
(Security Council Document 9/12636).

This Western proposal was
thereafter ratified by the United Na-
tions Security Council (UNSC) in its
Resolution 435 (1978) and as such
forms part of the resolution.

In Resolution 431 of July 27, 1978,
- the Security Council took note of the
Western Proposals, and requested the
Secretary-General to submit a report
containing his recommendations for
the implementation of. the Western
Proposals. Thusthe Western
were accepted by the UNSC in Resolu-
tion 431, In Security Council Docu-
ment 8/12827 of August 29, 1978, the
_ Secretary-Genera] made recommen-

dations, as requested in Res 431; later,
in an Explanatory Statement
(8/12869) of September 28, 1978, he ad- —
dressed and explained certain con-
cerns raised during consultations with
all the parties involved. Both of these
documents were approved in Res 435
of September 29, 1978, and the
Western Proposala were approved and
ratified as such by Rea 435 (1978).
