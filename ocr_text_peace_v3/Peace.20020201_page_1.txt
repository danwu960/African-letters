Bad Enough Without The Photo

THANK you for your services and for
“sull telling it like it is”, despite some
People who only like you doing that
when it is in their favour. But today’s
front page (Wednesday January 30)
is beyond the limits of what we need to
know. In other words: the picture on
today's front page is below your level
of journalism and nears your paper to
the low level The Windhoek Observer,
which I stopped buying when it pub-
lished the picture of the French chil-
dren that were murdered on the Caprivi-
Highway some years ago.
If I read in an article that a young man

cash than this is bad enough. If I then
have to read that he used an axe, it is
more than enough. How should my
level of information be enhanced by
seeing the picture? Instead I would
rather hike to know how a person can go
so far, better: how can a young person
lose his human and social values to
such an extent? What do the neigh-
bours and relatives say? How do they
think that they (and us) can prevent
such gruesome crimes in future?
Why are these kinds of crimes so much
incteasing nowadays? How did people
deal with them traditionally? etc. It is
this kind of question I would rather be

“At FS

interested in than seeing a dead kuku

with an axe in her head. Peace to her

soul. I am also concemed about the

feelings of the family of the victim and

the culprit not to mention all the other

people like desperate youngsters who

see this picture. Why do they nced to be
exposed to such atrocities? Do you
expect to sell more newspapers when
they have such pictures on the front
page? Please keep the quality level we
are used to from your paper and leave the
cheap and sensationalist journalism to
people who don’t know better.
