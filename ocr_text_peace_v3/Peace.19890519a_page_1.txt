southern Africa, is still miles away.
There are two major areas of concern
- the status of Walvis Bay and the
Angolan war.

Walvis Bay, Namibia's only deep
ocean-gomng port, poses a single major
threat to any post-independent gov-
ernment in Namibia as Jong as South
Africa continues its claim over the
port. Despite the United Nations rul-
ing thet Walvis Bay is an integral
part of Namibia, Pretoria continucs
to regard and treat the nort as part and
parcel of South Afric].

Walvis Bay is not only a vital
anchorage for imports and exports,
but provides a large military base
and airstrip for South Africa tw con-
tinue its destabilising tactics against
the neighbouring black African states.
This will enable South Africa tokeep
war away from its mainland. No
county has so far dared to launch a
direct attack on the South African
illegally occupied Namubia as a spring-
board for its periodic incursions into
southern Angola.

Walvis Bay has even greater im-
plications in terms of its relationship
to a fubure independent Namibia. Since
the port 1s part of South Africa, those
Namibians residing in Swakopmund
and elsewhere will need to have visas
to leave and enter the port. And a
horde of Walvis Bay residents em-
ployed at the Rossing Uranium Lid,
outside Swakopmund, will have to
periodically renew their visas to en-
ter and jeave the port on their way to
and from work.

Also, the SA officials travelling by
road to Walvis will need to apply for
visas to leave and enter Namibian |
territory. Walvis Bay alsa stands as a
potential cover for any opponents of
a new Namibian government, and
