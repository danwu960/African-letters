Outrage over Caprivi detention

THE LEADER of the Basubia
group (whose name appeared in the
people’s. paper of February 7)
Ngambela (Prime Minister) Robert
Ntelamo Sinvula of the Bukalo
authority, has been abducted from
his group and leadership by the
Katima Mulilo security police, and
jailed.

<= on several occasions roadblocks
were set up for him and his people by
police and army;

& his people were forced by police to
join political parties like the DTA and
UDP;

{ Mr Sinvula is a man of principle,

~~ —

law and order and discipline among
his people, and he controlled his
group for the maintenance of peace;
C he stood for the truth and because
he opposed confusion among his
group he was jailed under AG 9,
which is contrary to the bill of rights.

Mr Sinvula practised law and
order among his people.

I therefore call for the immediate
release of our Jeader, Mr Sinvula.
Why should the security police in-
volve themselves in politics among
our people? Why are they forcing our
people to become violent?

The Basubia people are now ex-

posed to violence since the man who
controlled their temper has been
abducted.

Allthe people in Katima detained
under AG 9 are members of the
Basubia group. One of the detainees,
Mr Richard Kamwi, has disap-
peared. How could he have escaped
when under lock and key and hand-
cuffed for several days while in
prison. The security police know
where he is. Why should they say he
has escaped?
