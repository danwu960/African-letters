Crime Is
Not Good

1 WOULD like to talk
about crime in our coun-
try. People are commit-
ting crimes because of
poverty. These people
should be punished for
doing evil things espe-
cially young people.

| strongly oppose all
those who are doing bad
things.

Let us fight crime in our
country and create peace
in Our society
