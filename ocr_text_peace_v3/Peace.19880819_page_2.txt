Most ofthe atrocities aré committed
by the black soldiers While often white
soldiers sit in vehicles, looki ngatand —
laughing when black soldiers beat
their own people. Therefore, | would
dike to say especially to black soldiers
totake note and respond to the follow.
ing facts:

-itisnotthetimeto commit atrocities
to your own people:

-remember that those people against
whom you discriminate wil] remain
your own people, your fathers, mothers,
brother and sisters:

- there will no day when white soldiers
will truly love you black Koevoet:

-it is time for you to throw away your
uniforms;

-leave the SA regime and let us unite
together in protest against SA regime
to taste the fruitsof peace, nationhood,
national unity, human dignity and
justice.

To my beloved Namibians,
