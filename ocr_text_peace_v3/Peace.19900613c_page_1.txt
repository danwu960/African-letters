RECONCILIATION is not a matter
of speeches or open letters in news-
pepers. Reconciliation is an act of
coming towards one another, talii=
to one another, looking together fe
the problem which is facing us and
finding a solution for it, so that we
can be truly reconciled and live to-
gether in peace. Accusations will
divide us more and make reconcili-
ation difficult to achieve.
The article in the CCN newsletter to
which Ms Regina Gerises is refer-
ring was written by Reverend K
Vermeulen. He w addressing the
question of reconciliation between
black and white and quoted what |
said in that regard. To refer to that
article as a ‘proof’ that I only see
reconciliation in terms of white and
black, is to take the nearest stick to
hit a dog.
At numerous occasions in public
meetings and in private discussions
my stand was an is that we must
openly discuss and resolve the ques-
tions surrounding the serious and
sensitive issue of ALL missing, de-
tained and dead Namibians, so that
we can be truly reconciled and re-
build our nation together in peace.
I therefore applaud the unanimous
decision of the Parliament to request
the Prime M‘nister after consultation
with the political parties in the Na-
tional Assembly, to head a commis-
sion which will investigate this issue

Opportunities to disc;

A serious breach

ON y ST; 8 mag asked to
resign from my position as Jub-edi-
tor at the Times of Namibif without
having receives Prior warning.
Manageerint claimed that my work
was co ote
A colleague | fiformed me that
he had begfi aware of the fact that I
was to be\Qred before this was re-
layed to me. Sur js is a serious
breach of confidentialny between
employer and employee
Many other questier(€in this regard
remain upartfwered. It was rumoured

that becausé Of the-decrepancy be-
tween the salanes paidte reports and
sub-editors, marrfgement had to fire

one sub-edftor in order to give a
salary inckgase of R50 to each re-
porter.

The company's high Maff tumover
due to what appears tote a policy of
indiscriminate effing and firing’ is
disturbing is policy creates an at-
mospheSe_of instability in the work-
ing environment and ins}cusity among
staff employed by-sht¥ establishment.
It would appear that the problem here
is Not so h the quality of service
but the financitMsigqation of the
newspaper. It is a pity tha\instead of
trying to solve problgar¥ in a more
constructive mgarkr, staff aro made
by managepr€nt to feel redundant.
