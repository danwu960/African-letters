In Praise Of Ruling Party

ALLOW me to express the feelings of ruling party
members in your newspaper. We in Swapo are
committed to democratic principles and therefore
Swapo is calling on registered voters to exercise
their democratic rights to vote in the coming general
elections.

We are not campaigning for a two-thirds majority
but for the overwhelming majority to rule this
country. It is not a secret that we are ruling, and we
have and will continue to rule Namibia according to
the democratic structures put in place by Swapo.

We in Swapo believe and know that democracy
will stay forever in this country.

Other parties have often relied on tribalism and
racism to promote their cause and they therefore can
claim to represent Namibia as a whole. It should
therefore be a wonder that Swapo has provided four
and ahalf years of peace and tranquility in Namibia.

We live in peace today because of the commit-
ment of Swapo to seek unity in diversity in our
country.

In spite of the fact that some opposition parties
have insulted S wapo leaders personally, itis Swapo’s
leadership and maturity that has never wavered
from the commitment to freedom of speech.

In the past years Swapo has committed itself to

nation-building, knowing that Namibians deservea
government that has priorities as they do. The
Swapo leadership has ensured development and
they also believe there must be contact between
government and people at all levels. That is why
Swapo has branches and sections at grassroots
level.

The Foreign Investment Act was passed, which
regulates the framework for foreign investors. In-
come tax was reduced twice. Job creation was one
of the top priorities.

In the next five years Swapo’s priority will be to
secure existing jobs and create new oncs. For exam-
ple the Free Trade Zone will create more jobs for
Namibians and that is part of Swapo’s priorities for
the next five years.

Tourism will be expanded and housing, water,
electricity, education, health, agriculture and fish-
eries will be promoted.

Therefore in the next five years Swapo will accel-
erate change by creating new opportunities for
Namibians through economic growth, better educa-
tion and health services and more jobs.
