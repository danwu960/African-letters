Std 8 impact

| TWAS made to believe that there is
a conflict of interests in this country
in the field of

Tam saying this because previous
_ history shows that in the past job
appicants were just taken in or

government
employees with less than Std 8 quali-
fications.

The buming issue today is the Std
8 certifitates and its impact on the
Namibian labour force. As we start
to reap the fruits of our country's
independence which we have fought
and died for, lying ahead is a politi-
cally-motivated blocking mechanism,
the Std 8 issue. Now, how can one
enjoy the fruits of hard-won inde-
pendence, if he/she does not possess
a Std 8 certificate?

Where do we go for a living, when
you are likely to face three questions:
Std 8 certificate; long-term job expe-
rience; and previous employer.

It is disappointing to have a door
closed in your face because you don't
have aSb8 certificate. What about
those with: practical experience?

This is a disturbing issue. How do
they expect someone who was forced
to leave the country and fight to
liberate it, to surmount this blocking
mechanism?

The government of this oountry
inherited a large number of people
with long- -term job experience. Why
can't â€˜they deputise these se poopie with
skilled labour force?

The Std 8 question is promoting |
division between the haves and have
ants.

- makers that we got togettwe and for-

Ha. nay ,
