On anti-Swapo

ON JUNE 9, | received anonymous
anti-Swapo literature. I have learned
that the literature has ',»een circulated
tomany people who are suspected of be-
ing members of Swapo in the Kavango.

What surprised me is that this
literature is the act of a coward, since
the documentation is not attributed or
named. The literature is full of mixed
texts extracted from various unknown
newspapers accompanied by 4 poor
Rukwangali version. It is also full of
anti-Nujoma statements such as ‘Nu-
joma het geslaan’ and ‘Vuishou 'n
akok’, to mention but a few.

Some Swapo executives in Kavango
were warned about what they were do-
ing, There is also a page of pictures of
eight people, probably emanating from
the socalled Parents Committee, with
question marka. These eight people

ae youl Deert you know that al
Kavengo-speaking people who

fled the draconian laws of a crue] col-
onialist regime in thiscountry? Don't
you know that these people (the
Kavango-speaking people allegedly
detained by Swapo) are enjoying a pro-
tected life; more so than us who are dai-
ly frightened and threatened by the
machinery of apartheid?

Who are you? You do not have contact
with the parents of the children in
question. The anonymous person who
wrote to me was not Kavango-
speaking for hedid not know the spell-
ing of my first name. I am not ‘Haiki’
The writer might be white Afrikaans
speaking, for they alwayscall methat.
Anyway, stop using my name!

Regarding the allegation of MrSam
Nujoma having hit a woman- we have
already read and listened to the true
newsmedia. President Nujoma is not
the irresponsible person that you
think.

We expect that you could contribute
more towards the people who are try-
ing to facilitate the implementation
of UN Resolution 435 which is the on-
ly way to bring about peace in
Namibia, and not the way of propagan-
da which you have chosen. Pray with
us.
