Permit issue

I WISH to air my disappointment
about the issue of permits to the
travelling public between Rundu and
the Caprivi.

Fellow Namibians, it hurts tosee the
travelling public suffering likethey do
inthe country of their birth. Ever since
the introduction of the issue of permits
by the SADF eight years ago, it seems
that Namibians are not much concern-

- edabout it.

The permits in question is not a
statutory law ofthecountry butrather
an imaginary law introduced by the ar-
my to cause severe hardship to Capri-
vians and the travelling public.

The army should immediately and
unconditionally do away with the issue
of permits, for if not, Namibians will
be left with nooption than tochallenge
the validity ofthe permits in acourt of
law. Members of the travelling public
are checked and their clothing left in
the dust road, after every 50km stretch
from Bagani to Kongola.

A poor Caprivian motorist with his
family, was travelling from Katima
Mulilo to Windhoek and at the
Kongola army checkpoint was ordered
todrive 120km back to Katima to have
his provision of fish written on the
socalled permit. He had to refill hiscar
with petrol for a second time although
the permit in question does not
stipulate the inclusion of provisions of
any kind. Though you are in possession
of the permit, it does not offer you pro-
tection of any kind, because it is
stipulated that you travel at your own
risk. What is the use of carrying
something that does not give you any
protection? What is the use of iden-
tification cards issued to Namibians
and residents? The behaviour of Up-
ingtonians and people trom the Cape
is intolerable and they must be sent

- back to where they.came from.
