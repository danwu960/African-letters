filtration. But we; the parents, found |

out that you took them beyond our nor-
thern border, about 200 ki lometresi in-
side Angola. |

Why did you dothat while youknew |
very wel] that Angola is afreeandin- |
dependent country which has never |
threatened Namibia? |

Also be honest and tell us now what |
you actually want in the People’s |
Republic of Angola.

Are you not satisfied with the
unlawfull and illegal detention, the
rape, the killing of innocent Nami- |
bians and the destruction of their iand
and property?

What else do you want? What other
sacrifices are to be made by the African.
people, whose only desire is freedom
and justice? - |

We, the parents of those serving in |
101 Battalion are nowtiredofmourn- |
ing for our dead sons who you, South

Africa, took to Mavinga. We are also —
tired of your empty and false promises —
of compensation. |

Just pack upand leave Namibians in |
