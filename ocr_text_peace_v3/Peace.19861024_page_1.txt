It is dishonest to nominate someone
who has been in Namibia for six
months and ignoring those who were
born, and are going to die, here.

National unity?

I WISH to air my point of view on the
cabinet of the government of national!
disunity, which tried hard to unite
the people but instead just succeed.
ed in uhiting Namibians against
them. This government should
therefore be disbanded.

Since the interim government was
imposed by the South African
government. the socalled ministers
in this government started arguing
among themselves and sometimes
even went to court > disunity

Instead of finding wavs tu improve
the living standards of the people,
they came up with inhuman laws
against the Namibian people; instead
of working for the interests of the
Namibian people, they have been
working for the interests of the South
African regime; instead of bringing
about justice in this country, they
have contributed to the rape of

justice.

Theoretically the ministers pro-
pegate that apartheid no longer ex.
iste in Namibia, but apartheid is stil!
in existence in virtually every part
of the country.

They have failed to abolish AG 26,
AG 9, AG 8 and other draconian
ary Instead they have stre n-

n the Nami-
bian people. nen

These self-appointed ministers,

especially Mr Andreas
claim to be in favour of reconciliation

Shipanga, all -

propagate in the Bill of Righta if he
does not want Professor Lombard to
express his views about Swapo?

In view of the above, and other
facts, the interim government should
be disbanded, and the South African
Government should allow the Nami-
bian people to elect their own leaders
through the implementation of the
Resolution 435 peace-plan.

I fee) that a pefaon who has an
abortion is guilty df murder. How can
you kill an unbgrn child, because
that child also hhs the right to live.

Abortion is a sid, whether done pro-
