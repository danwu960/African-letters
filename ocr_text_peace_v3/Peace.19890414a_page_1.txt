PLEASE allow meto air my views
regarding the position of Mr Martti
Ahtissari in the current situation in
our country:

Sir, we are very perplexed by your
attitude tow ards our people under the
leadership of Swapo.

It is amazing that, as UN Special
Representative, who has come to
Namibia to make sure that the inter-
national procedures leading to inde-
pendence, are carried out with jus-
lice and without partiality to any
party, you have given the order to the
troops of South Africa to hunt down
forces who in fact were in thecountry
prior to the ceasefire.

This, to us who are yearning for
our freedom, clearly demonstrates
that you have taken a partial decision '
in favour of our colonisers. !' is a pity
that instead of bringing abuut peace,
you are encouraging the forces of the
racist. goverment to climinate
Namibians.

Swapo isa well-disciplined move-
ment and would not defy the guide-
lines and regulations set up and agreed
to concerning our transition to inde-
pendence.

Insteac of deploying Untag
peacekeeping forces two the area of
conflict to separate the warring sides,
you decided in favour of the one side.
Swapo forces then had no alternative
but to defend themselves against those |
who started hunting down our com-
batants.

Sir, if justice were to be done, you
would have acted impartially to
solvethe conflict. The Government
in Pretoria may have planned these
acts of violation in advance, to jeopar-
dise the peace process. They knew
long ago that anumber of Plan forces
were based inside Namibia. They
attacked our fighters on the day
implementation of the peace plan
started, and them put the blame on
our forces as the violators of the
peace process.

Then most of the world, including
Thatcher, started blaming
