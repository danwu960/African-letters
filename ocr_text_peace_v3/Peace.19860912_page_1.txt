Pralse for them

I WOULD like to praise Professor

Lombard and Mrs Parkhouse and

others for their courage in meeting

_ with the Swapo leadership in

_ Lusaka at the 10th anniversary of
‘UNIN.

They have showed us that there

are some whites who want to see
~Namibia freed from South African
occupation. They have also set an
example to other whites, to show
where they stand in the struggle
towards a non-oppressive and non-
exploitative, free Namibia.

I would personally like to call
upon the white majority to stand
up and join the struggle in order to
gain independence for Namibia.

Let us unite: black and white and
not allow ourselves to be misled by
the evil forces which try to under-
mine the struggle of peaceloving
Namibians towards freedom.
