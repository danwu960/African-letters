From A C

Ountry At Peace

ToA Country At War

With pamibia I knew, is the one
a crime rate, Streets
and homes. But saler

What doyouleave behind for your
children? In a nutshell, a country
identified by crime, marked by crimi-
nals, shadowed by house breakings
and »and eventually deaths.
It all rest on our shoulders of moth-
ers, fathers, politicians, churches,
schools, government inter alia.

t can you do to prevent this

from happening? The need for effec.
Give active action arises. We need to
integrate, and work together as a so-
Clety, put our differences aside and
think about the children of tomor-
row, Of are you selfish of ignorant
enough not to think of the children of
today? We need to “act” before the
shadow is cast over us all, and then

there will be no tomorrow for us or the
children.
