A Pain For The Youth

I WILL always be saluting the patron-
age of this widely read and informative
newspaper. The Namibian newspaper
still has the monopoly in terms of good
reporting both during the colonial and
post colonial period - itis still reporting
things as they are.

The aforementioned statement can-
not be defeated by any useful and re-
sponsible Namibian citizen. The gov-
emment does things without looking at
the implications associated with its ac-
tions. One would always wonder if the
top government officials, including the
President, have advisors at all. Being

unemployed, we the youth of this nation
learnt with dismay of the government
ban from advertising in the Namibian. It
is very expensive for us job seekers to
buy both the New Era and The Namibian
at the same time. If the government is
shameful to come back to The Namibian
it must establish a free of charge weekly
paper where we can get the government
job adverts. Otherwise there will be no
need to campaign for the next elections
nor bark about peace and stability.
