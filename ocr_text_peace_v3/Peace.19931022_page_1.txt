_ Of civil servants that the

of staff mem-
bers will be able to ad-
| just themselves to the
ongoing restructural
' problem.
It ts obvious that the
progress. bf any cbuntry-
— is seriotisly jeopardised
when the civil servants
are not well informed
about the ethics and re-
sponsibilities of civil
servants,

Right Honourable Prime
Minister, Comrade Hage
Geingob, emphasised the
following:

* qucucs at govern-

* terminally bureau-
cratic offices:

*sense of commiulment
and dedication;

* the use of the tel-
ephone:

* recruilment, promo-

and accountability.

It is my personal un-

servants must be acutely

peace, orderly develop-

the country. Obviously,
we can only achieve this

ministeries. Some per-
manent secretaries de-
cide to be exclusive and
some are so dismissive
that they are no longer in
contact with theirstaffin
particular and the public
in general. Some resort
a0 much secrecy that
