On Matijila

This is an open letter to the so-
called Minister of Education, Mr
Andrew Matjila and I refer to his
shameful speech on the Radio
Owambo in the Okambiya
Kamahola programme.

He was speaking about boycotts in
the north as well asin Katutura, Win-
dhoek. What upsets me is when Mr
Matjila said that the students have
nothing todo with the implementation
of the future plan, Resolution 435.

This arose from the time students
wrote placards demanding the im-
mediate implementation of the peace
plan.

How can he say we students are too
young todemand the implementation
of the plan?

I personally say to him that we
students are not children and foolish.
He has allowed himself to be used by
South Africa.

I warn Mr Matjila to tell his
Makek as to end the tear gas and

bullets as the way of supprees-
ing Ing the â€˜atrikes We students are the
won of i tomorrow and we are not
