Meaning of peace
IN THE WAKE of Christmas and my
dealings with The Namibian during
1987 I foe) myself compelled to write
you this letter in my personal capaci-
ty in order to set the record straight on
the real meaning of the words peace
and goodwill.

After an in-depth study and research
on the reporting as presented by The
Namibian during the past year! come
to the conclusion that no objectivity
was portrayed by your newspaper con-
cerning the South Weet Africa situa-
tion. Instead, you tried to portray the
enemy, Swapo including all its wings
and associates as the “peace-seekers”.
Nowhere could I find a cal! to stop ac-
tions by these organisations which are
detrimental to our country and all its
inhabitants, euch as boycotts,
sabotage, etc. Na, you rather opted to
go for the “alternative view” of
revolution.

Let me give you only one example:
Just about every week some kind of ac-
trocity by the security forcea was
reported. The security forces spelt iot
out clearly that no atrocities by

of the security forces
would be tolerated. Members who
are found guilty by a court of Jaw will
be punished accordingly. However,
when Swapo claimed responsibility for
the bomb blast at the Gustav Voigts
Centre you reported it to be “a
demonstration of Namibian people's
tesolve to shake off the yoke of col-
onialiam by all necessary means”. Is
this promoting peace and goodwill?

Swapo opted for the revolutionary
methods some 21 years ago and let us
be honest, they've lost face, both
militarily and politically Although
you portray this organisation tobe the
“true liberators” of thie country, |
guarantee that freedom will be
something of the past IF they should
take over the reins. However, that ia
hardly to be foressen.

In you socalled “bumper edition”
dated December 18, 1987, to January
8, 1968, you predict another year of war
in your “political perspective’ column,
however, in the same breath you call
Upon organisations and individuals
“to re-assese and come up with a con-
crete and effective plan of action to
break the chains in 1988 andreach the
goal ofa free Namibia’ Thus, l accept
that you areatthesametime wishing
for peace and war. This isa contradic.
tion I'l] never be able to understand.

Please keep in mind: Swapo opted for
war. Thisis what they got. The securi-
ty forces were in being long before the
existence of Swapo and if you look at
the alm of any defence force in the
ighey you will notice that their duty

smongat other thesafeguarding of
Ife, property and freedom.

1988 the security forcea will maintain
this aim!

May [ wish you not a worldly “hap.
py” festive season, but my prayers are
that you may also experience the love
of God towards mankind manifested
through the birth of Hie Son, our
Saviour and Lord, Jesus Christ, in
whom we trust to build the future of
this beautiful country with all ita
inhabitants

NOTE: Don't talk absolute rubbish,
Commandant. You should know
better. An in-depth study and
research of the reporting in The
Namibian, and frequent, virtual
weekly reports of security force
atrocities (on your own admission)
should be telling you something.

You would prefer, obviously, that
because the Defence Force has
stated that “no atrocities by
members of the security forces wil]
be tolerated”, that we should not
report them at all. 1s this what you
define as “objectivity’? While on
the subject, perhaps youcouldtel}
us how many members of the
‘security’ forces appeared in court
for atrocities, and bow much, in
claims of compensation, has been
paid out by the military tomembers
of the civilian population in the
past year? We wonder whether you
even keep such statistics.

Interesting too, to see that you
classify Swapo as “the enemy”, and
amal) wonder ‘security’ forces
target civilian members of the
population who support the move-
ment, Have you fo
are apparently fighting against the
People’s Liberation Army of
Namibia (PLAN), and not Swapo,
which is a legitimate and legal
political organisation in this
country?

The Namibian neverclaimedthe
bomb blast at the Gustav Voigta
Centre was a ‘demonstration of the
Namibian people's resolve to shake
off the yoke of colonialism by all

neceesary means". Your assertion
in this regard is entirely without
factual basis. .

The‘security’ forces in this coun-
try have not maintained the aim of
“safeguarding of life, property and
freedom” as you claim. Quite the
contrary, in fact.

And since you have the temerity
to talk about spreading the “love of
God”, perhaps you dexplain to
us why a socalled ‘Christian’
defence force commite such ‘un-
Christian’ actions and why the ma-
jority of Christians inthis country
call for the withdrawal of your
defence force? - Gwen Lister

SADF answer call
Dear Editor

Your comment: latest act of sabotage

1. It ig not normal procedure for the
SWA Territory Force toseek comment
from a newspaper, however, in the light
of your openly anti-SWA Territory
Force campaign, we feel it necessary to
ask your comment on the incident on
Saturday, December 19 1987, at Pep
Storea.

2. If this act of sabotage would have
been successful, hundreds of people
could have been either dead or maim-
ed or seriously injured. It was only the
ersce of God that saved South West
Africa of a disaster, initiated by a ter-
rorist who obviously has no feeling for
human life If, and we are sure they
will, Swapo claims responsibility for
this senseless deed, will itbe portrayed
again as “an act to demonstrate the
will of the people to free themselves
from colonial rule’?

8. We truat that The Namibéan wit.
react to this in order to show exactly
where it stands.
