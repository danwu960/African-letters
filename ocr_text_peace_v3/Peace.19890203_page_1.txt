‘A sensitive nerve

Indeed Mr Shipanga's ‘New Year's
Message’ touched a sensitive nerve
in me, especially with the untruths
and political dishonesty that ‘mes-
sage’ displayed.

In his articke (27/01/89) Mr Shipanga
implies that because Father Wolfe
had said that ‘‘reconciliation of the
Namibian people as a whole is needed
before we can become one Namibia

the word ‘reconciliation’ on televi-

reconciliation is not merely an event
- it is a process in which not only
what we say, but also whal we do,
will determine the essence of our
determination.

believe your sincerity because you
use the words ‘peace’ and ‘reconcili-
ation’, even more so when your frame
of reference is artificial: (that your
TGNU protected the rights of Na-
mibians during the past. three-and-a-
half years).

| maintain, Mr Shipanga, that your
Cabinet sided with the South Afncan
‘government in trying to stop duc
legal process, and I add that all this
was done at the expense of the tax-
payers. Please say this is not true, and
