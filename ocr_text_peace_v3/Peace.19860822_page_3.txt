Is my assumption justified that you
support Swapo's numerous calls and
statements for the increase of violence;
that you reiterate threats made by
Swapo leaders that Swapo will
demonstrate its power if her
unreasonable demands are not being
met; that you know Swapo has in-
timidated inhabitants of this country by

threatening to step up their acts of

violence which includes specifically
bombings?

The murderous attack on civilians in
Walvis Bay on August 2 was one of
those bombings which Swapo threaten-
ed to execute. If this is not the fact, then
you Dr Shejavali, should request Swapo
to deny responsibility for this atrocitly
and those recently committed in
Katutura and Khomasdal as well as

those numerous acts of terrorism
against our own people.

You are in favour of the implemen-

— tation of Resolution 435, so am Land
_ the majority of our people. But we de.
mand this be on the basis of a fair.
