Coup or no coup

IS that really the question?

At ans time I believed very strongly
Ghat whoever is responsible for tho
Timea of Namibia editorially, has
some sort of death-wish. I could just
ant believe Ghat exxybody with a sane
mind could write or allow such rub-
bich 10 be written as in the

petitical columne of the Times. |

erate being belittled and called all
so sof names, is the question in the
mands of so many Namibians, and let
me assure the Times and DTA that
they are many.

I think now that the Times is cer-
tain that there 1s po action that will be
taken; there are even timos when it
revertstonaked racism in ite descrip-
tion of ‘black’ African countries, while
reference to South Africa creates the
impression of a docile dog creeping
with its tail between its logs in front
of its master. Lest ] deviate, let me
return to the issue I am writing about.

The belief that whatever deliber-
ately negative remarks or unfounded

Yt

accusahions are made against the
govemmment will force it to collapse,
borders on insanity. Boasting about
handedly with such reports ehock the
imagination of any human being. Itis
with this in mind that I read of the
‘Evidence on Namibian coup’ in the
October 5 edition of the Times.

The said newspaper reports oxten-
tively on evidence given by Josef
Kjeynhans, who told the court that
some people tnedto recruit him fora
‘coup’ against the govemment. The
concept that itis only armiescapable
of staging coups, as repeatedly said
by the Times, is 20 ridiculous, but
their attempt tocreate the impression

that the arms theft was only a minor
‘adventure’, is, 1 fee] an aftempt to
downplay the seriousness of the crime.
The thieves will finally, in the cyes
of the Times, be nothing more than
‘youths in search of adventure’.

I hate to think what would have
happened if such a theft took place in
the previous dispensation and if the
‘adventurers’ were black and not white.

This comes after weeks of spocu-
Jation in the same newspaper as to
whether there was really a coup plot
in Namibia or not. It is interesting, to
say tho least, that this nowspapor
should now have a headline report on
the coup. One wonders about this
paper's sense of journalistic ethics,
for in the past couple of weeks it
decried the coup story which was
broken by The Namibian as a ‘fig-
ment" of that paper’s imagination.

Now the Times of Namibia will
probably become the champion against
the coup. It seems to be trendy for the
Times to, on the one hand, deny the
existence of a coup and on the other
to be the first to report on evidence
given about it.

Whether one calls it an intended
coup or not, is purely academic. In

fact, the scademic masturbation a
coup or ng coup does not im:

Now the opposition pepiers oes
call it what they want, can even g

cepts of coups, but we, the Namii
