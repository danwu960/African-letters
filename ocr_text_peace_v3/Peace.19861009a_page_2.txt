I do not know whether Mr Ronald
Reagan and his administration know
what the word ‘peace’ in the real
sense means. The policy of ‘construc-
tive engagement’ seeks to perceive
communist encroachment on South
Africa; and seeks to keep the region
safe for American capital and to use
the South Africans to police it.
