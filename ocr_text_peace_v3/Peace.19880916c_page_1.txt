‘Werds of passion

WE FACE an enemy that is deep-
rooted, an enemy entrenched and
determined not to yield. Our march to
freedom is long and difficult, but both
within and beyond our borders the pro-
| spects of victory grows bright.

The first condition for victory is

black unity. Every effort to divide

blacks must be vigorously repulsed.
Our people must be united into a
single, massive and solid wall of
resistance of united mass action. This
isnot the time for the luxury of disuni-
ty, we must close ranks at alllevels, and
differences must be submerged to the
achievement of a single goal which is
the complete overthrow of apartheid
and racist domination.

The revulsion of the world against

apartheidis growing.. The world ison
our side, the OAU, the UN andthe anti-
apartheid movement continue to put
pressure on the racist and colonial
rulers of our country. Every effort to
isolate South Africa adds strength to
our stuggle. At all levels much has
been achieved and much remains tobe
done, but victory is certain.

We must look beneath the veil of con-
stitutional formulas and deceptive
phrases to see the face of apartheid, the
rattling of gunfire and the rumbling of
Hippo armoured vehicles

South Africa, Angola, Mjzambique,
Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Lesotho
still have to shed blood to defeat the last
bastion of oppression and blistering in-
ferno of racial hatred.

In the name of all strugglers, de-
tainees, the banned andexiled, I wish
to share my deepest sympathy. My
bleeding heart is with the bereaved
families. thank them for this priceless

sacrifice. Let it be known that the op-
pressed shall be free, the bars of the
prison shall be broken, the people have
mounted up with wings like an eagle
because they know that the end of op-
pression is at hand, our moment has —
come, we shall be free and peace shall

reign.

Amandla Ngawethu, the struggle
continues. So comrades, unite,
-moobilise and fight on. co
Between the anvil of united mass ac- —
tion and the hammer of the armed |
. struggle we shall crush apartheid and
‘white minority raciat rule.
