THE lingering debate and pos-
turing by political Pundits, tra-
ditional leadership, the ordi-
nary citizens and ‘outsiders’
about the need or not for Presi-
dent Nujomatorun for another
term, the so called ‘Fourth
Term’ as Head of State, can be
likened to a rhinoceros, which
looks different depending on
where the observer is Standing
and what portion of its anatomy
he/she is concentrating on.
Each perspective has some par-
cular insights and each is only
a part of the whole!

As an ordinary Namibian
citizen from the Caprivi Re-
gion, I am therefore delighted
to hear of yet another concerted
and well-orchestrated cam-
Paign to convince and/or urge
our President to seek another
term.

There is an American Say-
ing, “if it ain't broken, don't fix
it’. My positon is simple and
goes something like this: the
inconclusive leadership transi-
tion (no domestic pun intended
since most of the senior leaders
tn the Party and Government
are seasoned, tested and com-
petent) that the fecently held
Swapo Congress Produced,
raises important questions
about who will really be in
command should President
Nujoma step down after the
expiry of his current term.

While I am a great believer
in ‘collective leadership’ (it’s
casy if you are one of the cho-
sen ones), I suppose I've be-
come disillusioned with poli-
tics - and I think most
Namibians have become disil-
lusioned with politicians too.

Happy About Fourth Term Cam

An intellectual friend of
mine once commented,
“Namuibians don't want to ac.
cept excuses any more - if
there's money tobe stolen, why
isn’t there money for the Ppeo-
ple?” It would appear we still
don't have our Priorities right.

Once upon a time I was al-
ways fixing everyone else's
problems, but not my own and
gucss where it landed me?
What has all this to do with the
Fourth Term, you may ask?

Despite a mosaic of tribula-
tions and misplaced Priorities,
every day I ask the question:
‘Can President Sam Nujoma
do no wrong?” The answer is
an emphatic NO.

Namibians love him above
all other Ministers and even
the feeble and weak Opposi-
ton grudgingly admires his

Political talent. At his age,
President Nujoma has lost none
of his charisma he had inexile
and is a man of all seasons
liked by all Namibians from
any comer of this great nation
of ours.

Perhaps the Breatest asset
credited to President Nujoma
1S good governance.

Since independence on 21
March 1990 delivered high lev-
els of security, Provided qual-
ity education and health serv-
ices, respected political

ms and human rights,
framed a strong rule of law,
bolstered an economic frame-
work conducive to growth and
has provided an environment
in which civil society can flour-
ish.

Hence, there is a direct cor-
relation between good national

BOvernance and economic
Prosperity.

Ordinary Namibians havea
right to expect a better life af-
ter all the sacrifices they en-
dured during the liberation
struggle. People do not fight
for ideas but for Peace, mate-
nal benefits and a better future
for their children.

The majority of Namibians’
expectations of independence,
namely, their sincere hope that
freedom from colonial rule
would usher in a new era of
basic rights and freedoms long
denied by settler rule. This is
what the liberation struggle
meant for ordinary Namibians.
President Sam Nujomaiis there-
fore an embodiment of the
aforementioned ideals.

The big question for Presi-
dent Nujoma, therefore, is not

as much opposition from anm-
chair critics from the West,
amateur politicians or ‘

sition parties " but the envy of
his own Colleagues, some of
whom have bowed out due to
their political naivete.

President Nujoma has one
rule: he says something each
day and in such a manners that
it becomes the talk of the aa-
ton. He is therefore in the Spot-
light most of the time - all of
which impresses the Namibian
voters and makes his fellow
politicians seethe with jeal-
ousy.

How debilitating then tocrit-
ics with hidden agendas, thas it
is President Nujoma who is
geting the good headlines.
