Reply to Shipanga

THIS letter follows one by Mr
Vezera Kandetu (The Namibian
January 14 1989) and to the reply by
Mr Andreas Shipanga. | was going to
shat my mouth al this ume, and merely
hope that the future would bring me
and fellow Namibians the best.

When Shipanga joined the TGNU
he knew very well that they would be
Tesponsible to the Government of
South Africa, and he chose to fight
for freedom, liberty and self-deter-
minabon with the South African
Government, with Botha ‘leading the
tevolution’ and the Administrator
General as the man in charge of the
socalled ‘defenders’ of the nghts of
Namubians.

What does Shipanga mean when
he says ‘It is just this sort of hubns
which has hampered the struggle for
truc liberation in Namibia for so tong
and encouraged the armchair revolu-
Uonaries to waste their words and
deeds on irrelevancies’.

To tell the truth, Shipenga is one of
those who hampered the struggle for
trus liberation if he remembers what
he did in 1978: he divided the free-
dom fighters. And the description in
question fis him very well. Let me
say, he hes been an annchair revolu-
Uonary who has been wasting his
words and deeds, by way of cheating

Gi Namibian people along with other
pell-aays, ona of he and his

colleagues made the South African
Government realise that they could
not enforce its rule through Namib-
ian intermedianes, and so they went
to the negotiating table.

The TGNU never had the power to
decide, and the South Afncan Gov-
emment got what it wanted from the
intenm government.

Swapo would like united people as
itis their mou to unite the Namibian
people. But how can it succeed in
uniting the people if there are those
like yourself who are always divid-
ing the nauon. Swapo will unite and
join hands with fellow Namibians in
order to build up the nation you dis-
appointed, and the beloved land you
betrayed.

On the quesuon of your call on
Swapo to release the detainces it is
holding, that is none of your busi-
ness. After all, some of these things
are already provided for in accor-
dance with UNSCR 435 (1978) and
629 (1989), and all dates and events
are based upon the Annex to the
seiuement Proposal $/12636 of Apni
10 1978, just in case the South Afri-
can Government hasn't bnefed you.

Why didn’t the intenm govern-
ment repeal laws such as AG 26:
many Namibians have been detained
without inal, and the interim govern-
ment did not question this.

There are no atrocities in Swapo
camps; and it was you who started
Organising brother to stand against
brother, and sister against sister.

Just look at the man who likes
paese and who sccs himself as the
nation's Ubaraior, praising the Koevoet

One may forgive, but not Sarget,

On AWB leader

ALLOW me to air my view
people's newspaper andet my
feelings with rue Narfibians about
this man (Hendpe van As, leader of
the AWB),

This_yfm As looks like an adult
m but I wonder ... He exhibits
discriminanon and racism gr seems
to hate the Ovambos. € talks about
crimes but he capatt prove that the
Ovambos bryai€ the record with re-
gard to rpp€, theft and killings.

WB always complain about
cngfes but they have people who
clqim to be members of the terrorist
g oun * ob and wha
about their influence in the’army in
northern Namibia.

Van As calls

jn the

Ovambo's ‘un-
civilised": bu alever their state it
is due to policies of racism and
ap. rim posed by the South A fri-
can Government, who have also denied

emtheir findamenial human rights.
] want to let peogle like van As
know that the Souu/Africans gave us
bantustan-type pducation; once we
are responsibi€ for educaung our-
selves, we on run this country with-

out Van A's and his kind. We don’t
want sodalled ‘white wolves’ here
anyway.

Neither can Van claim that
Hereros and Bastege’don't want a
Swapo gov fi. He is merely
talking on behsfT of the stooges of the
South A fripdn Government, and act
the peoplé.

ther Van As likes it or not, im
this dountry we want to get rid of
colonialism and South Alfican ocou-
pation and we wish to gain fad
ence. Down with the AWB And ‘Wh
Wolves’. Up with of Nesnibie,
