national terrorist groups to prevent Chris.

" tians from serving the Lord. Christian Ac-
tion will also continue giving people like
you, Ms Lister, the opportunity to meet eye
to eye with genuine Christians who per-
sonally experienced how Swapo and their
allies persecuted people who refused to ac-
cept and support an anti-Christian ideology.
We will go to extreme efforts to show how
falsecertain ‘clergymen’ and their imitators
are in their preservation of basic human
rights. You, Ms Lister, know that we are
referring among ethers to the socalled
‘Swapo 100”. You yourself have appealed to
Swapo to give these people a fair trial, and
to advise their next-of-kin and to permit
legal representation for these people. You
Ms Lister, have done this, but noclergyman
bas made such an appeal.

There are many more aspects that Chris-
tian Action will convey to you and the in-
habitants of this country. You will be plac-
ed on our mailing list in future. We do,
however, reapect the feelings of every per-
son, and enjorse the Charter of Fundamen.-
tal Rights as is expected of true Christians,
and therefore don't mind if you ignore our
newsletter. You know that the truth often
hurts. Don't fear that Christian Action will
force anybody to accept what we say. We tell
what we know. Christian Action does not in-
timidate. Christian Action does not require
anybody to move from door to door to
threaten people will death ifthey will not ac-

| cept what we stand for. Christian Action will
not plant mines, or plant bombs in butcher
shopa and service stations, or destroy the
homes of innocent people with explosives.
Christian Action will also not call on
clergyinen to open their churches to
cal parties and socalled. freedom
phters so that they can promote heresy.
