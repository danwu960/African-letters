‘Apartheid’ At Cheetah Festival

PLEASE allow me a
space in your newspaper
to air my concern over
Otjiwarongo Cheetah
Festival which was or-
ganised in June by the
Otjiwarongo Tourism
Forum.

Initially it was a con-
cept to attract potential
investors toOyiwarongo
and expose the opportu-
nities we can offer.

However the end result
of the so called Cheetah
Festival was just another
form of apartheid and
racism which was or-
chestrated toonly benefit
the minority (whites) on
the expense of the black
masses.

My rationale for call-
ing it this is based on
the fact that the black
participating cultural
groups received a dif-
ferent, discriminating,
inhuman and insulting
(treatment. The occasion
was organised so stra-
tegically that the black
groups were performing
at a separate location
at the ‘white elephant’
museum rather than at

the main venue (open
space next to the town
Municipality) where
the white groups were
performing. The main
venue was where most
of the activities and pco-
ple were concentrated.
This was indeed a local
investment centre forthe
festival.

Black groups on other
side were not even al-
tended by the organisers
and worst of all, no-one,
apart from the participat-
ing groups themselves
turned up at the socalled
museum. How did the
black community ben-
efit from the so-called
festival apart from be-
ing used to cyeblind
the local politicians and
waste their time and
energies? The level of
community involvement
from the initial stages

of the whole organisa-
ion is questionable if
the festival was indeed
aimed at benefitting
the entire Oyiwarongo.
After consultations with
the organisers, one of the
black groups was told
to perform at the main
venue, but when they
turned up at the main
venue they were again
told that there was no
place organised for them
to perform.

It must be clear that
We are raising this issue
forthe sake of protecting
national reconciliation
and for the peace and
stability to prevail in
Namibia. To this end,
1 call upon the local
politicians to look into
this matter.
