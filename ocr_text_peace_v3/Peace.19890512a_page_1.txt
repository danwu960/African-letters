Ways find it casy to translate that
wish into action. Under arbitrary rule,
people are apt to become lethargic,
their senses are dulled. Fear becomes
the dominant force in their lives; fear
of breaking the colonial and apart-
heid laws.

SWAPO, who led the struggle for
freedom, broke through this apathy
and fear. We gave active expression
to the universal longing to be free.

Our leaders strenghten the peoples’
faith in themselves, and encourgac
them to take part in the freedom
struggle.

I am convinced the unity of the
Namibians outweigh those who di-
vide us.

Forward with the struggie.

Who's monitoring

Which is the monitoring force,
UNTAG or the South African Army?

1. It looks as if Mr Ahtisean can-
not refuse or argue any request oF
move put forward by the South Afn-
can government

1.1 After the security force al-
tacked the PLAN-fighters on Apnill,

he allowed the South African army to
leave their bases for a large attack on
SWAPO fighters.

1.2 After the confinement of the
South African troops to their bases
for 60 hours, we find they had al-
ready left their bases before the des-
ignated O6h00 on April 29. They
started to fire allert shots during the
whole night of the 28th. The UNTAG
forces in the north will agree with
me. From 02h00 on the moming of
the 29th their Casspirs and Rauels
were on the road.

Why do they have to monitor the
withdrawal of the SWAPO fighters?
Will SWAPO fighters do the same
when they withdraw? What is the
UNTAG force doing here?

2.So many Koevoet/police are
deployed and moving around in
Northern Namibia in their Casspirs
amongst the people. Why don’t they
stay at their police statons? Is it
because because there is noroom for
all of them? The whoke KOEVOET
was just give thename ‘police’. Why
keep such a big police force? Is is yust
to distribute DTA pamfiets, helping
in their campaign as they did on
Apni] 29 at Othingo, on the west of
Oshakati and elsewhere?

3.Does Mr Ahtisaari know that
South Africa is doing all this to vio-
late Res 4357? Does he know that
South Africa wants to waste time
unt] no more time is left and they
will come up with requesis to with-
draw the peace ou

4. For years, South Africa has told
us that the people of Namibia will
decide on their future. It docs not
seecm to be the case. Let South Af-
rica withdraw her forces, we can get
along with the UNTAQ forces.
