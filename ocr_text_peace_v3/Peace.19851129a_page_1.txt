A vast
distinction

I CRITICISE and seriously con-
demn the attitude of some Caprivi-
ans towards their fellow citizens. The
Namibian newspaper is not there for
criticising fellow citizens. If youdon’t
have something relevant to be pub-
lished, don’t waste the paper you're
writing on.

It would be better for Caprivians
to concentrate and improve the Ad-
ministration in the area. We all want
independence, but people who
betray and condemn will never give
us independence.

We must live in peace so that the
Lord will give us better ways in which
to solve our problems and which will
lead us to independence.

At present Capriviis separated in
two sections. What causes this? In
the first place, tribal politics, in the
second place, lack of foresight andin
the third, money.
