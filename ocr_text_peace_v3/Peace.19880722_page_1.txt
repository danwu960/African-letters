AN open letter to Nanso dissiderite: |
| (Katjiua, ‘Rukoro; Makari, Zauana,
Keramata, Tjimune and Siririka):

Iwould like to reply to your long letter
which appeared in The Namibian of
July 15 in which you shameleasly
revealed your anti-Swapo sentiments
(or fears of Swapo).

lam responding to your letter in my
capacity asaSwapo member andlam
in no way stating Swapo's policy on
political rivals, however, I believe that
the overwhelming majority of Swapo
supporters would agree with me.

' No doubt you belong to the ethnic
party which is trying to unfairly be
called an equal of Swapo inthe libera-
tion struggle. I myself, initially, and
until very recently, wrongly believed
that Swapo should join hands with
what is referred to(sometimes wrong:
ly) progressive groupings against the
common enemy.

But after your letter and your party
Secretary General’s(properly termed)
‘thinly-veiled attack on Swapo' at
Okahandja, I have changed my mind
and suggest that this idea be
relinquished.

You mentioned in your letter that
students who are not Swapo members
aare sialedy and Swann ‘'P’,
