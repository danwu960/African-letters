yourselves. There are always two sides.
The one who gets oppressed, and the other
who allows it to happen.

Namibians have suffered a lot and they
struggled to be free. Now let all Namibians
be free. Try to become open and tolerant of
every group in our society.

Truc freedom is that everybody can do
what he or she wants fo do, as long as it
does not hurt or harm any other person.
This is my personal guideline.

A big headache

THE opportunists among Namibians
-could cause a big headache for our future
government.

It toems to me thal most white Namibi-
ans with an oppornunistc nature are those
in the ‘private business scctor’ and blacks
are mostly former members of SWATF,
perticularly 10) Battalion.

it is sad, and at the same Lime logical,
thal some of the 101 former soldiers are
not prepared to serve their country in a

same or morg money than they got
the colonial regims.
this Is logical’ to me is because if

now Namibia defence force, demanding -

they were not opportunists they would
have refused to join enemy forces in the

“first place.

What salaries were paid to our Namib-
ian heroes, Swapo Plan combatants who
fought for so long to liberate Namibians
from the oppressive South African re-
gime, including the SWATF members?
Do they feel no shame?

If they were in Romania they would
serve life sentences or be executed by
firing squad. If they think they can get
more money elsewhere, they are free to
look for better paid jobs.

It is their democratic nght to say no.

As far as | know Namibians there are
enough men and women who are ready al
any lime to secure our freedom, to guard
our borders and protect our peace and
defend our democracy, filled with a spint
of reconciliation and forgiveness, willing
to work and serve the new-born Namibian
nation.

Long live Namibian patnots!

Anti-toxic waste

| WOULD like to respond to the article
in the ediuon of 15 Febmary entitled
‘Namibia ideal for toxic storage’.

By reading the headline atone it be-
comes questionable as to whether the au-
thor and whoever shares his views really
have the interests of Namibia at heart by
advocaling and sven promoting this de-
structive idea of dumping nuclear wasic
on our soil, for whatever reason.

the argues further that this will provide
employment for Namibians. Who on earth
would accept a job that means digging his
or herown grave, however much they are
paid to do 107

Not even a a fool woutd do that. The
author speaks of protection. If there is
protection, thén why would anyone want
to dump those poisons in our country and
not sjmply in the countries where they are
