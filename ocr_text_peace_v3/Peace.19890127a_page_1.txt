Reply to Matjila

IN your first issue Kor 1989, Mr
Matjila is reported as having
indignantly repudiated, on behalf
of the nation, an ECOSOC Com-
mission finding that the situation
of Namibian women needs ur-
gentattention. More specifically,
he declares himself satishied with
the manner in which violence
against women is handicd by law
enforcement agencies and the
courts.

The Minister is cnuuled |
personal opinion on what
ures are ‘strict’ and what punish-
ments ‘appropnate’. But the real-
ity is nol sorcas$uring. Aticntited
readers of the English language
weeklies - especially reports of
Criminal and divsce proceedings
- will have noticfd that violence
against women Is escalating al an
alarming rate, and that there has
been no noticeable suffening of
the penalties for rape in order to
arrest the trend.

The reality is this: rape is a
capital offence, and all reported
incidents must therefore be tuned
by the Supreme Count. In 1986

160 cases were reported, of which
94 were brought to tial, In 1987
the figures were 201 reported and
114 tried, in 1988 266 and 67
respectively. It must be bome in-
mind that the shadow figures for |
sexual assault are always higher |
than the numbers of cases re-
ported to the police. In Namibiait —
~ has also been a general rule that
only cases of rape which are
aggravated by breaking and en-
toring, thefl, grievous bodily harm
or murder are prosecuted at all.
Of the 637 cases of rape re- |
- ported in the past three. years, 204 |
