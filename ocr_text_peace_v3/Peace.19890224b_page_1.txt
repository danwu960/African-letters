pleted a job in 24 houra, whereas

end an assistant completed
a similer task in 12 hours. Still,
we as semi-skilled employees are
unequally compensated. At
Rossing there are approximately
118 Grade 8° 8 with an average of
more or ess 10 years of experi-
ence. So - can the grievances of
roughly 118 employces be ‘‘indi-
vidual grievances’’ as claimed
by Rossing?

According to Rossing, they
normally require NI and N2 to
recognise employees as artisans.
| This is a requirement enforced
about four years ago. How is it
possible for a white person from
Holland to be employed in a skilled
position without a qualification?
Why is it that the mentioned for-
¢cigner was transferred from the
workshop to another work area
Only after the stasement on Rossing

discriminatory practices appeared
in The Namibian (10/02/89)? Why
was the position frozen and not
filled with a Namibian? Is Rossing
preaching more than pracusing
their so-called Namibianisation
programme and only using it as
propaganda?

These, and other questions, when
answered, will prove that al
Rossing not all is praise.

Solidarity with fast

WE, the Justice and Peace
Commission of Windhoek Vicari-
ate, wish to express Our compas-
sion and solidarity with those
political detainees who are held
without trial and are fasting for
social and the transforma-
tlon of South African society.

We therefore, call upon the
South African Govemment to

release them immediately and
unconditionally or charge them
in a court of law.

It is appropristeduring this
present time of Lent that all Chris-
tians offer up their fasting acts of
self-denial to protest against in-
justices that are perpetrated by
the SA Government through the
racial policy of apartheid.

Wealsc call upon governments
worldwide, and the international
community to use their influence
in calling ceaselessly for the
unconditional release of the po-
liucal detainees and toensure that
a just political dispensation is
formulated in South Africa.

Lost manhood

A WORD or two to all Namibi-
ans, black and white, who want
democracy and peace in this
country.

To a large extent the evil-doers
have succeeded in producing, at
the output end of their machine, a
kind of black man who is man
only in form. This is the extent to
which the process of dehumanisa-
uon has advanced. The type of
black man we have today has lost
his manhood. In the privacy of
his ‘pondok’ his face twists in
silent condemnation of white
society, but brightens up in sheep-
ish obedience as he comes out
hurrying in response to his mas-
ter’s impatient call. Sometimes
he joins the chorus that roundly
condemns the white mastors, but
is first to praise the South African
