"AN OPEN LETTER TO DR
ABISAI SHEJAVALI

NEITHER YOU, Dr Shejavali, nor any
of your colleagues of the Council of
Churches (CCN) have as yet reacted to
the barbarous bomb attack on innocent
civilians in Walvis Bay on August 2.
Nobody expects you as a Christian to
take sides in the struggle over
SWA/Namibia, but as a christian you
should condemn all forms of violence.

granted that you condone one form of
violence and condemn another suiting ©
your own political whims and
aspirations. |

As the majority of my countrymen
I condemn violence of any form to
achieve political aims. Nobody denies
that members of the security forces do
commit violence against members of the
local population. Such members are
however brought before court and [ can
substantiate this statement with a list of
trials. | do however assume that you
doubt the impartiality and in-
dependence of our courts of law.
However it may be there is not one case
Swapo has brought before a courifof
justice to try one of its members can-
mitting atfocities against innocent
civilians.

On the’ contrary: Swapo cold-
bloodedly. murder a mother and young
child in Grootfontein. The same peo-
