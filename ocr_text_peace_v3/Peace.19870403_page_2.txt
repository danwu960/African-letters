read what Christian Action stands
posed to what you stand for. We pale
ly ch you to consider investigating

Action, and to publish your fin-
dings. We, in turn, will definitely not
hesitate tokeep the publicinformed of CA's
activities.

Ms Lister, you and your accomplices were
requested in no uncertain terms to submit
in writing your queries about Christian Ac-
tion, to ensure that Christian Action if not
victimised by a person's own, possibly incor-
rect, understanding of the true meaning of
comment made by Christian Action.

You however considered yourself too
elevated to correspond with honest people.
You even went to far asto twist the little we
did say. Christian Actionâ€™s request that was
that you put your questions in writing so
that we would have a clear understanding
of your inquiry, and you would have an ab-
solutely clear understanding of our reply.
The material would then have been very
useful to both you and ourselves should a
misunderstanding have arisen. Would such
action not have been more responsible and
professionally journalistic?

You, Ms Lister, really have nothing
against Christian Action assuch. You have
a tremendous amount to say about the fact
that Christian Action vehemently objects to
socalled clergymen who are more involved
with politics (and not even objectively) than
with their spiritual taske. It is nosecret that
Christian Action identified the fact that cer-
tain socalled clergymen attempt to mislead
their congregation so that anti-christians,
communists and suchlike can force their
own ideology which contradicts the Bible,
on their people. Therefore, all you could do,
Ms Lister, was to attempt to cast suspicion
on the strong point of view made by a
member of Christian Action.

What you did will not work, Ms Lister. You
forget thet Col Radmore is not Christian Ac-
tion. You forget that Col Radmore is a
Stoalelicnd fhetatian whn dna not hasitate
