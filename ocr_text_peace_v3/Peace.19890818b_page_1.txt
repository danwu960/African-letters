IN Oshiwambo there is a proverb
which says: Omufundji oku vule
osnulodhi. It means a liar is worse
than a witch. The saying continues: It
is better to accomodate a witch than
a liar.

I have been battling to understand
the proverb of my ancestors. My
question has been, why did they look
upon liars with spprehension? (I pould
be happy if someone could give fur-
ther clarification).

For many years we have been out-
side our beloved motherland - parted
from our parents, sisters, brothers,
friends and comrades. We have al-
ways been dreaming of home.

It also pained us when we were
told that some of our relatives or
fends penshed in the bloody 23-
year war. Therefore, we understand
what it meant when some of our
fellow compatriots were told that
their nextof kin were ‘eliminated’ by
Swapo. These lics have causcd
immense damage and confusion.

Maybe our ancestors were afraid
of liars because what they said did
not only affect a limited number of
people, but the enure population. A
witch destroys only one or two people,
and then that is the end.

When liars speaks of death, they
mean life, when they speak of de-
mocracy, they mean tyranny, justice

= injusuce, reconstruction = destruc-
tion, freedom = oppression or captiv-
ity, decolonisation = colonisation,
freedom from South Afnca = de-
pendence on South Africa.

These are the people who nearly
destroyed the Namibia peace process
by concocting lies that Swapo com-
batanis infiltrated Namibia on Apnl
1, whilg many of them had been in-
side already.

Lies were fabricated again when it
was reported that Swapo combatants
were moving south of the sixtcenth

to prepare for a big incursion
Nasnibis - an absurd statcment

We have been lied to many times,
we will not be lied to again
