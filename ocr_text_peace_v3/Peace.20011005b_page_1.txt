Who Are The Real Terrorists?

ALLOW me to express my views in your esteemed
newspaper. They are in connection with the ongoing
confusion of the Angolan situation with the main news
topic in the intemational political arena, namely the fight
against terronsm.

I take this opportunity also to express my condolences
to the Amencan people for the loss of lives on the [1 of
September events.

It1s clear by now that the terms terronst and terronsm
have to be redefined and a consensus to be reached
amongstall that belong tothe human race. The way ahead
is challenging but also highly rewarding. Basic justice
and a dignified human lite for every inhabitant of the
earth are at stake here. The concems about state terrorism
should be given the necessary attention. For instance,
enforced disappearance and arbitrary Killings of citizens
committed by state authontes should be considered as
acts Of state lerronsm,. A typical example of such as state
in Africats Angola.

The longest, bloodiest. and most destructive and largely
ignored contlictin Africa ts being staged in the beautiful
landscapes, hills and savannahs of Angola. Twill refrain
tromdis ing deep into the causes of the crv il war that rages
for decades now, for they have been exhaustively cov.
ered. Tam going to stick to crucial facts to refresh the
memory of those in oblivion. who stl] fantasise in giving
tothe Angolan niling party tree hand to continue deer
mauneg the Angolan population and plundering the natu-
ral resources. For those. a hittle piece of advice: forget it,
Or at least, think reasonably alf over again. Here are the
facts:

- The MPLA did start the civil war Tin 1975:

- The MPLA did cheat the veneral elections in 1993
and tnitiated the civil war Th

- The MPLA violated the peace accord of Lusaka 1994

by resuming military operations aimed at total destruc-
tion of Unita (its old sweet dream , by the way).

The MPLA leadership, who successfully metamor-
phosed from demagogic communism to venal capital-
ism, never had the guts, stomach and neither the slightest
desire in the distant past and now to face real opposition
parties. Why? The answer is quite simple: the Angolan
Cake is so awesome, astonishing and magical that it will
constitute a sacrilege to share it with someone else other
than the top few people of the ruling party. Thus the
current tragedy. In this regard the intemational conimu-
nity, especially the Wester countnes that continue to
milk the proverbial wealth of Angola has done very ttle.
As a result the majority of Angolan population live in
abject and sordid poverty contrasting. very painfully,
with the unashamed opulent life style of few ruling party
individuals and army generals.

Calling Unita and Dr Savimbi terrorists? And what
about the atrocities committed by the Angolan army
forces, security. the police. and many other paramilitary
orgamisations under the patronage and tmpheit support of
the unqualified and non-elected president JES? Is this not
considered state terrorisay?

Can you unagine the number of deaths caused by the
consututional, military, law and security enforcement
agencies lawlessness, of the so-called Angolan goverm-
ment? Do you have any tdea of the death toll caused by
hunger and starvation. lack of health services, uncontrol-
lable banditry and even lack of potable water including in
the capital Luanda itself, derived from the chronic eco-
nomic mismanagement. blatant incompetence, rampant
cormuption. nepotism, of the so-called Angolan govern-
ment?
