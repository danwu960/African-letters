Therefore, after independence,
Namibia should change its clocks to
the 15 degree time zone. as the 15
degree eatern longitude actually nins
through Namibia. (Ask any gcogra

Not a negative force

THE assessment as to who our
enemies currently are by the Director
of the Association for the Handi-

HOTIIUANJTA,
.' MARIE KOTOKA,
TIANA,

4 tive foros in

is currently more or less correct.
siteation should give us the few
yeers of peace we need in order to
build a truly professional military
establishment.

However the future is unknown to
humans and we are unable to deter-
mine now what the situation will be
in fifteen years. Military expens
throughout the world agree on their
assessment conceming Africa south
of the Sahara. It is dangerous un-
stable power keg ready to be touched
off by the smallest spark. In response
lo uhis situauuon America, France.
Britain, Russia (and soon Maly) have
Organised specially trained and
equipped forces to conduct military
operations in Africa.

Contrary to the Director's appar:
ent belief, amilitary establishmentis
not a negauve force in the develop
ment of a county. It can, if struc
tured in the proper way, achieve all
the objectives outlined by the Direc
tor for the Development Force

Tn addition it can serve as achan
nel for technological transfer, devel:
opment and expansion of our indus-
tnal infrastructure, our off-shore
fishing industry (three of the world’s
largest ship buliding Companies agrec
with me on this) and intemal and
extemal transport networks. Itcan be
a positive force in raising the educa
tional level of future generations,

, effect positive changes within our

society and itss the only vehicle that
has the potenual of being a melting
pot to change our diversified people
into pne people one nation while also

as a shield of protection of
our freedom.

For four years I have been study-
ing how our new military establish-
ment should be organised, structured
and equipped to achieve these goals.
Tt can be done within our financial
means.

The military profession through-
aut the world has and is working hard
