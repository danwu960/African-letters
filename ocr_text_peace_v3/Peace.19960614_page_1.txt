MINISTER Gert
Hanekom has been re-
Ported as advising the
Hospitality Association
of Namibia (HAN) at the
Organisation’s recent
congress, that it should
decide whether it wants
a “free, Unregulated
market” or a regulated
one. It is a point that the
Prime Minister made
some time ago. As the
Prime Minister and Min-
ister Hanekom have
both said, HAN cannot
have it both ways.
Minister Hanekom
also requested that our
association and HAN

nised under new legisla-
tion. We must point out
that Minister Hanekom
is essentially advocating
a regulated market, sim-
ply for the sake of what
he hopes will be some
degree of peace in the
industry. But such a
compromise will not
bring peace, because it
will not address the one
question that we have
always posed: Why
should successful small

businesses be driven out-~

Should try-to reach- “Of Dusifiess, just becaiise

agreement on the mini:

- Mr Johnnie Hamman,
the new chairperson of
HAN, is reported as say-

ing that HAN has re-
duced its demand for a
minimum number of
rooms, from ten to five
“to enable new legisla-
tion to be passed”, In
Saying this, he pretends
that HAN have made a
generous concession.
But it is far from being
generous; in-fact, it is
cleverly constructed SO
that, if it were imple-
mented, it would wipe

although we cannot ac-
cept the wiping out of
the business of 95 per

will accept the destruc-

would 55 per cent be
Sufficient for Mr
Hamman and HAN?
What Mr Hamman
and some members of
HAN are Proposing is,
in fact, much more than

~The destruction of, say,

thirty or fifty successful
Small businesses. They
are proposing that new
legislation should out-
law the prospect of most

Namibians ever being
able to share in the ac-
commodation industry
of their own country in
an entrepeneurial way.
They are effectively pro-
posing that no home-
Stead in the north of Na-
mibia should be able to
offer accommodation to
tourists. They are effec-
tively proposing that no
resident of, say, Rundu
or Otjimbingwe should
employ the facilities at

her or his disposal to of: -

fer accommodation
commercially. They are
effectively proposing
that no Namibian with-
out access to capital re-

» Mr Hanekom

sources of at least half a
million dollars (at inter-
est rates of above 20 per
cent) should be able to
enter the accommoda-
tion industry. And they
are demanding that the
Namibian state should
ratify this discrimination
against its own citizens.

We call upon the me-
dia and the public to rec-
ognise that this issue is
not simply a matter of a
disagreement with HAN
and the Budget and
Home Accommodation
Association. It is a mat-
ter of principle: and that
principle involves the
question of whether or

not the majority of
Namibians, who were
denied meaningful ac-
cess to economic activ-
ity under apartheid, will
continue to be denied it
under new legislation of
the type proposed by
those who benefited -
and still benefit - under
the outdated Ordinance
20 of 1973. If members
of HAN are successful
in their demands, then
economic reactionaries
in other sectors will be
encouraged to attempt
the same.
