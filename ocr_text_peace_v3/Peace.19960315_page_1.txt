1 AM against the conference planned
for May this year by the Secretary
General of the Council of Churches
(CCN) the Rev Ngeno Nakhamela
about the detainees during the war and
the feedback given by the so-called
‘Executive Director of the Society for
duman Rights Mr Ya Nangolo.

ia bese ideas must be stopped before
eed Te-open the wounds which have
oe ee treated by national recon-

“Truth Commission Not
The Right Solution ...’

Nr § USRSSE

If things go on like this, let us put
reconciliation aside and start to fight,
because Mr Ya Nangolo always fights
people.

A psychological war is more pain-
ful than a war with guns.

Why can’t we stay in peace rather
than fight each other.

Forgive and peace shall set us free.
