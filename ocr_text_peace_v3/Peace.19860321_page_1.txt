Women and youth exhorted to unite against aparthe

AS WE usher ja this year of peace
and harmony, Swapo must assist the
women to take an active role in the
political fe of oar country. Nocoun-
try in which women do not have
equality with men, can be truly
democratic.

Women of our country and all the
whites who identify themselves as
truc and sincere citizens of Namibia.
who are yearning for a change,
should be accomodated in higher of-
fices and responsibilities in the party.

We must continue tenaciously
with the struggle. consistentls
demanding the prinaples of one man
one vote to be applied.

The first stepistopiveesery adull,
irrespective of race or creed, the right
to vote. When citizens enjoy equali-
ty of status with others, then the bar-
riers of race and colour will disap-
pear and people will mix freely
together and will work for the com-
mon good of society.

Our peopk are the masters of their

own lives, designers of their own
future, and dictators of their own
destiny. The illega! rule in Namibia
must be brought to an immediate
end.

No government can continue to
impose its rule coercively in the face
of the conscious defiance of the over-
whelming majority of its people.

L appeal to all progressive forces
which are fighting to establish ge-
nuineand democratic institutions in
the country to unite and form a
strong blog. No minorities, whether
they be BMlack or white, can fear a
united people.

While Swapo and all progressive
parties and institutions in ts coun-
try are intensifying the struggle for
emancipation and human dignity.
Swapo must not turn down honest
and authentic talks which could lead
toaceasefire. Swapo must talk to the
apartheid regime and not tothe self-
proclaimed government of national
unily.

LETTERS

Women of Namibia! The hour has
passed when women were made to be
mere spectators of events. Your
husbands are not paid adequate
wages. Your children are walking
around with empty stomachs and
they do not receive a proper educa-
tion. They are taught in segregated
schools and you do not have decent
houses and recreational facilities.

You do nat have equality. with
men. The voke of oppression is hur.
ting vou and sou should naw de-
mand vour rights

Youth ofthe country! Do not give
into intimidation. Wedo not havea
legaladministration inthis country.
Those whe proclaim power do not
have the mandate. You are the
citizens of today and tomorrow and
the salt of this nation. It is to you we
are looking for new values. Come out
resolutely. Stand up for justice to

prevail in Namibia.

Remember apartheid is hike cancer
inthe body politic of the country. It
is repugnant with the symptoms of
hatred, fear and relentless violence.

To draw up a constitution at this
juncture without the participation of
all the parts concerned, is fraudulent
and an indignity to our very ex-
istence, Regard it as null and void.

Close your ranks in the spirit of
peace and harmony Surmount your
problems with vigour and determin.
edefrors, discharge your duties with
honour and fulfill vour obligations
promptly. Eradicate the abominable
policy of apartheid from the face ot
our country.

The State. President of South
Africa ty not sincere in his proposal
for the implementation of Resolu-
tion 435, and he has no right to link
the independence of Namibia with
the withdrawal of the Cubans from
Angola.

The Cubans are in Angola at the
invitation of the Angolan Govern-

ment, and ever since they went to that ;

country in 1975 to date, they havenot
attempted to violate the territorial
boundaries of Namibia or. South
Africa.

I see no logic m the proposal of the
State President. One would have ex-
pected Mr Botha to be more realistic
and practical on this desperate issue
of Namibia. An issue which took so
many years to discuss inthe interna-
tional forum.

Angola is a sovereign member
state of the United Nations and
under the present Charter of the
United Nations. No government or
individual has the right to impose
dictates on that government.

JP W Botha, as the leader of South
Africa, can only have the Cubans
withdrawn from Angola through
peacetul negotiations and not
critical and enipty proposals based
On malicious intrigues.
