described as a Pfesbyterian

minister.

As asffember of Ian Paisley’s
self-made Free Bresbyterian

False statement

PLEASE permit me to answer to
the embarrassing statement ‘
Swapo does the same, but nobody
complains ...’ in The Namibian of
May 16.

The angry residents and their
tribal chief, in and around Om-
balantu in northern Namibia, are
totally against the actions of the
South African Police and Defence
Force and not against Swapo.

Obviously the people in the
north are annoyed by the South
African Police and Defence Force’s
‘systematic and cleverly planned’
manner of waiting until the
harvesting period before these units
come in and destroy their many
months of hard work.

in ‘Windhoek, the Police
: *s comment on the in-

has no military vehicles, which ac-
cording to the complaints, the
SADF drove through mahangu
flelds and homesteads. How can
someone from the north be ex-
pected to believe such a statement?

While the police and army claim
to be the defenders of the people,
the Namibians themselves have re-
jected this claim, since Namibians
have experienced untold crimes at
the hands of these forces. These
cannot be erased from our minds.

We do fear the action of these
forces and call for the immediate
withdrawal of South African police
and army. We want peace, justice
and truth and this can be im-
plemented through Resolution 435.

The Namibians have tasted the
colonial fruit of the South African
Government and its puppet institu-
tions in Namibia, and it tastes
bitter.
