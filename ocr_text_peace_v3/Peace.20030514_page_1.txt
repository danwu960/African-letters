Paper. Our Priday April!
25 2003. the NBC Tv

showed the liberation
struggle of our country.
It was especially good
that those who don’t
know the history of this
country could learn and
See for themselves how
Our people suffered dur-
ing the colonial era.
Often when you talk
about the difficult times
Our people went through,
some people think you
are joking and by watch-
ing the programme on

Bae Eo. A

Knowing Our History

And Our

TV they will know what
happened during the war.
The colonial times were
terrible and those who
know the history will
never forget.

A new peace and sta-
bility is prevailing in our
country. We should know
that the freedom we en-

_ Joy today has cost a huge

number of Namibian
lives.
Brothers, sisters, moth-

Sacrifices

€rs and fathers from all
Comers of this country sac-
lificed their lives for this
land and all of us who
enjoy freedomtoda y need
to thank them, respect
them and honour them
for the contribution they
made during the strug-
gle and for the independ-
ence of our country.
Today, we have na-
tonal reconciliation, and
I call upon all our people

to unite and reconcile as
citizens of one country,
and work together towards
social economic develop-

ment, improving the
Standard of living of all
Our people, reducing the
unemployment rate in the
country as well as Poverty
and hunger. Lastly, Ihope
peace and democracy will
remain in Namibia.

Anyone whotnesto de-
SUOy peace in this land
must be brought to jus-
tice.
