Objective view

ASA socalled white South African, liv-
ing in Jchanneeburg, and not a
member of any one of the great number

of political parties in Namibia, I feel I

have the right to try and objectively

assess the incident of November 30

where the supporters of Swapo were

routed by what is generally known
here as Koevoet.

I was invited to the peace rally (sic)
by friends. I went there because, being
a South African, 1 thought ‘How
wonderful. I always thought Swapo
was a banned organisation’ (At least
that is the way I was indoctrinated by
the press in South Africa). So] went.

It was quite an experience. People
singing and dancing, a group of
children splendidly dressed in Swapo
colours, dancing to the tune of a whis-
tle, blown by a small boy. And the
Swapo police! Dreesed resplendently,
some with wooden AK-47 rifles,
painted blue, green and red. Tradi-
tional kieries and spears (covered with
cooldrink cans to make gure the sharp
points cause no incidental harm).

The peace rally was opened with a
prayer. An old black man, praying in
Afrikaans, for the rally to be peaceful
and in the name of God. There were
some speeches and then a group of
socalled vigilantes started injuring
people and damaging cars inthe road.
They were chased away by the Swapo
police and we all started singing again,
determined to allow peace to get the
upper hand.

The next moment Casspirs arrived.
Much too soon to have been summon-
ed from the police station. They were
close and ready. The hatches flew open
and the firing started. Horribly sud-
den. A terrible and unecessary act of

ked violence.

The air was thick with teargas and
rubber bullets. We all ran, blinded and
choking. They never stopped. On and
on. We hid in houses from the choking
fumes, babies gasping old men lying on
the ground. They chased us from hotse
to house I ran like a scared animal,
jamping over fences, chicken coope,
washing the burning skin of my face
and eyes in basins filled with soapy
washing water.

After halfan hour, things quietened
down. I ventured back to the area. |
crossed a poo! of mud in a street, sud-
denly realising my my stomach chur-

that it hadn't rained. It was blood.
mud. I put e note under a wind-
sereen of a friend'scar.

Then they came again. I crawled
wortlike under the car. | knew | would
he at the very least injured ifthey saw
sue, white person, there.

By ugw they wore firing teargas at
random into houses. Houses of people
who weren't even at the rally. Houses
with emall babies, screaming and

hide. In the house, an old woman,
maybe ninety yearsold, embraced me,

saying over and over Jy moet leef, my

hind. Jy moet leef, my hind:

Eventually I reached safety through
rides with other reporters. That was
yesterday (Sunday). Today (Monday)!
read the news: “People started fighting
among themselves .. the police
endeavoured to bring peace ..”” and
worst of all, this line in an editorial col-
umn: “This time Swapo will have todo
much more than the tradjtional ac-
cusation that the police are responsi-
ble for the violence’ (Translated from
Afrikaans).

Whatcan I say, except, that ifthese
are the workings of democracy, Nami-
bians should wake upto reality. Do not
allow your fut and the future of
your children, to be placed in the hands
of demented perpetrators of violence,
acting under the cover of reality. I beg
you, wake up.
