Cry of the masses

THE CRY of the Namibian masses has
gone up for the umpteenth time to
vanish into the annals of ignorance
and hatred.

The plea of my people for self-
determination and unobscured self-
rule has been met with brutal assaults
by members of the notorious Koevoet
against those who dare tosay it aloud.

So the war, waged in Namibia in
general and inthe north in particular,
has its effects on everyone not-
withstanding his political sympathies,

Those who withstand the war of
liberation are indoctrinated more to
suppress and destruct, legally, in the
name of the colonia] power and the
unelected elements of political

opportunists.
