United States Election

tem ie it appeared
Florida county laws were applicable
to the recount argument during the
election court Proceedings and not
perhaps the National Constitution

duplication, disparities and contra.

and what the Electoral College does.
During the election proceedings in
the Florida Supreme Court, | Tecall
one judge was reported as saying the
US election 2000 fiasco was caused
by people who did not follow voting
instructions. This can be an ambigu-
Ous or explicit statement, was it due
to the illiteracy of the voters or the
complication of ballot papers as al-
leged by the Democrats? From my

observation people are altributing it
to illiteracy.

According to that judge's state-
ment, it is Overt that the voter's illit-
eracy impelled/incited the whole
election process/ballot counting to
be referred to the court for a verdict.

With regard to the change of US
