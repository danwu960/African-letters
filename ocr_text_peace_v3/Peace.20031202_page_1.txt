Use Your Power Wisely

RE: your story on the outcome of
talks between the NAU and Nafwu
(Nafwu says NAU meeting ‘a total
failure’, November 2003). In the
article, you describe the talks as a
failure. The fact that some common
ground was found, which, considering
the delicate and inflammable nature
of the topic, is quite noteworthy, was
merely mentioned in the last sentence
of your report. Another daily
newspaper based their headlines on
this very fact, that some common
ground between the parties was found.

As members of the media, you
directly influence public opinion and
thus hold immense power over the
course of political events and
ideologies. | find, in the interest of
peace and stability, certain sensitive
topics should be handled more
carefully, and not become victims of
purely profit-oriented sensa-
tionalism. It ts not in the interest of
the Namibian people that this

particular and other topics become
even hotter than they already are; by
feeding on the negativity of certain
events, you are definitely not acting
responsibly.

If instead, you focus on positive
aspects in your reporting, this will
propagate in the public mind and
eventually become reality. This
principle of suggestive reporting is
well known and in a more negative
context it borders on propaganda.

There is no such thing as unbiased
reporting; so against this background,
please realise your power and its related
responsibility, and use it toeveryone's
advantage.
