THE price of silence will
be tantamount to let havoc
reign in people's lives al-
ready inamess. Overhasty
statements and false
claims are also mislead-
ing and will only disad-
vantage those already dis-
advantaged.

I will not remain quiet
nor turn a blind eye to a

campaign designed to ben-

efit and enrich certain at

the expense of those

Namubians from Caprivi

who moum today, because

of a number of hardships

their families, exiles and

treason suspects are going

through.

False claims like‘under-
ground resistance groups’
will only ruin and create
more problems for people
in the Caprivi region and
heighten high levels of in-
security. Therefore claims
of having revived CANU

Canada where J live as a
Namibian refugee and can
only tell you that I fully
understand the move be-
hind such claims.The
move has nothing to do
with either independence
for Caprivi or the plight
and suffering of those
Caprivians from Namibia.
It is all a question of ‘self
preservation’ and ‘self in-
terest’ by the subject, who
has been denied “Refugee
Status” in Canada and who
wants to tamish his image
back home and that of the
Namibian government so
that the chances of possi-
dle deportation can be
minimised,

I also question the need
to source funds. Caprivians
must come to terms with
the fact that “no one was
drugged to be part of
Swapo in exile", and that

A misforume
on 2nd August 1999 ang
the way forward is to work
towards finding peace and
reconcilianon in Namibia,
parucularly with le
from the Capnvi re eon
who have been misled for
solong by opportunists and
liars. In a nutshell, should
the Namibian Government
pardon and grant amnesty
to UDP’s exiled leader-
ship, the release of the
Grootfontein Treason sus-
pects and call home all
exiled Namibians from the
Caprivi region, then we as
a government and people
would have accomplished
enough.

Weacknowledge efforts
by the Namibian Govern-
Ment to repatriate thou-
sands of Namibians from
Botswana’s Dukwe Refu-
gee Camp and hope some-
day that same hand shal\
be extended to all
Namibians currently liv-
ing in exile.
