Where Are

We Headed?

TAKING a close look at whatis happening tn our
region and in Namibia in particular as far as lead-
ership and politics are concermed, Fw ould like to
pont out two things that are increasingly becom-
ing a threat to our democracy

TOLERANCE - Namibians have seen a growing
number of cases where poliucians, especially in the
ruling party, have exhibited intolerance This hap-
pened after the launch of the new party and there
was namecalling, especially about Ben Ulenga.

Launching a political party is in line with the

Namibian Constitution and does not infninge on any

person or other party’s nght of existence.
CENSORSHIP - The fact that State-owned me-

dia are always reporting in favour of Government
and the ruling party ts a clear indication that there
is a great deal of censorship in the media. The state
is footing their bill, but as a taxpayer I want to be
fed with real, correct and factual information and

News.

Hearing lines like ‘the legitimate government of
President Kabila’ on NBC makes me laugh. What
makes Kabila’s government a legitimate one? Is it
because it was brought to power through the barrel
of a gun? [s it because Kabila overthrew a long time
dictator with the help of foreign. troops? Is it be-
cause Kabila happens to be a personal friend of
some of our regional leaders? Would someone

please tell me how Kabila’s government got its le-
gitimacy? °
In conclusion, I hope that our democracy, peace
and stability, that we chensh and-enjoy, does not
go down the drain. Of course we can only accom-
plish this if we are all tolerant-of one another as
countrymen and women irrespective of our politi-
cal differences and affiliation. colour, creed and

religion.
