Law of the knife

I WISH toexpress my feelings about
the violation of human nghis in
Namibia. At this point I would like to
urge my fellow Namibians to respect
life more than money or property.
Many people have lost their lives
since independence. Mainly because
some people do not want to respect
the laws and constitution of the
Republic of Namibia which provides
forthe protection of life, and other
human rights.
The use of knives to kill others is the
order of the day in Namibia, espe-
cially among young people. In order
to reduce or eradicate the problem
altogether, I appeal to the govern-
mem to introduce laws to prohibit
the carrying of knives in public places.
The knife is as dangorous as the gun,
and there nwust be punishment to
ensure that knife-users are deterred.
What we have to bear in mind is that
the killing of innocent people is a
violation of human righté in terms of
our laws,
Note that the constitution says that
all human beings are born free and
in dignity and rights, without
of any kind, such as race,

law of reconciliation, which should
promote justice. We are all seeking
peace and not war.

Please, people must obey the laws.
They should familiarise themselves
with them. Help to defend and pro-

mote them. The country belongs to
all of us.
