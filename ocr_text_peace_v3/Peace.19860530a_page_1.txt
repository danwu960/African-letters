Plight of Namibia

NAMIBIAN independence Is
delayed by the entire western world
with their intentions of exploiting
our country's natural resources and
promoting the illegal occupation of
Namibia by the South African
Government.

In 1978 the United Nations pass-
ed a Resolution (UNSCR 435)
which was to pave the way for our
independence through UN-
supervised elections.

Both Swapo and South Africa
had agreed to the implementation
of Resolution 435, but when
Reagan came [to power in
Washington, he and South Africa
brought in the linkage issue. This
is now made a precondition to our
independence.

The Cuban Internationalists
have been in Angola almost three
years prior to the introduction of
Resolution 435. They were only
found to be a threat after six years.

This is a feeble excuse and ploy
by western capitalists regarding
Namibia.

We in Namibia have tried on-

three occasions to bring and end to
the shedding of blood and the suf-

fering of our people, but all were |

in vain. In Geneva in 1981, Swapo
was ready lo sign a ceasefire and
put Resolution 435 into @peration,
and this was repeated in Lusaka in
1984 and on Cape Verde later that
year, but the South African
Government turned a deaf ear.
Mr P W Botha told the world
that Swapo was the one delaying
independence and opting for
violence, whereas Swapo had stated

often that a ceasefire was the only —

way to end the war.

if Mr P W Botha could just tell
us openly that he is afraid of a
Swapo victory if Resolution 435 is
implemented. Swapo would win
the elections overwhelmingly,
which is why the Reagan Ad-

ministration is backing Pretoria on |

the Cuban issue.

The South African Government

is again playing with us by saying
that Swapo must talk to the interim
government in Windhoek. Why
should Swapo talk to their sur-
rogates? The country is not oc-

cupied by Mudge-Shipanga- —

Katjiuongua, but by Pretoria.

They talk of reconciliation, but —
