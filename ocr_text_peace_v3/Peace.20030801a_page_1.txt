Tam talking of these Afnean
Patriots who have seen their con-

and have acted by working out
SOME strategies on how to liberate
Africa fully in the economic, so-
etal and pohtical sphere

African leaders who in their re-
spective countries hacked the feet
and hands of their people with
machetes, enriched themselves,
are racists and plunged their coun-

Mes into vicrous eyeles of caval
Wars and economic

disasters
