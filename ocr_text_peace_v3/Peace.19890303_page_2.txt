body in the USSR today has enough |
food and clothing. | am convinced
thal even in the most communist â€”
states, citizens enjoy more democ-
racy, more freedom and more justice
than the majonty here in Namibia.
The waves of protest in the commu-
nist countnies today, like the one in
Poland, is not directed against the |
communist system itself. The Soli- |
danity Union in Poland is not an anu-
communist movernent, which is trying
to destroy the Polish socio-political
structure. In fact, the union leaders
are better communists than ther rulers.

To many of those who so strongly
criacise the communist way of life,
communism and marxism mean the |
same thing, which is also wrong.
Somebody can be communist and |
not marxist; he can be Stalinist, Maoist |
etc. :
I myself do not adhere to any ide-
ology. I concern myself as a Chns- |
tian only, but to be a good believer
and Chrisuian does not mean to be
ready to kil] communists and non-
believers.

Rather it is to mean to work to-
gether and work in peace and har- |
mony. If we are not prepared to do
this, our future is bleak. To try to |
bring people to your side by creating |
a fear of the unknown is primitive
and cheap propaganda, which as such
is not a part of Western civilisation
which the SADF claims to defend.
