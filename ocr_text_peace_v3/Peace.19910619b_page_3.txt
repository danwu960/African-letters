Editor, if at all the Land
Conference wishes to achieve
peace, it has to address the
cardinal issues. There is no
way we are going to be talked
into improving current ‘home-
lands’. It is actually wrong to
talk of ‘homelands’, since the
whole of Namibia is OUR
homeland.

Reconciliation implies
wrongdoing. Wrongdoing
implies correcting the wrongs.
We cannot put the cart in frer
of the donkey. We have to start
at the beginning of the colonisa-
tion and end with the handing
over of Namibia to its rightful
owners, We are poor because
of the annihilation of land. How
can whoever expect us to raise
money where to raise money
with which to buy our land
back from whom?

Let us not be lured by the
forked tongues of land sharks.
They have no interest in Na-
mibia. Now is the time that
Namibia will be truly inde-
pendent, not only on paper but
in real jland ownership terms.

To those who are to attend
the Land Conference, know your
history and be solely guided
by it. We are all products of
our sad history, We are once
more in a new ora of
history for the gencratiatia to
coma.
