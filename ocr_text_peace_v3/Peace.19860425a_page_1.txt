THE UNITED States of Americais
fast becoming a threat to interna-
tional relations. Firstly she agreed to
give covert aid to the guerrilla move-
tment Unita, and the result of this is
that the President of the People’s
Republic of Angola will be forcedto
get more aid to counter the aid given
to Savimbi.
Can America then claim to be a
- | ader in maintaining world peace?
_ Secondly, the US attacked Libya.
is this 1 not a violation of the norms
oni ternational relations? Britain
aul also be held responsible for

US threat to international peace

this attack.

America is one of the super-
powers, and supposedly a
democratic country. What will hap-
pen when one of the superpowers
begin to attack other countries?

America gave Unita the aid asifto
say ‘there is the aid (weapons), go and
kill the masses of Angola’.

The attack on Libya showed that
America is barbaric.
