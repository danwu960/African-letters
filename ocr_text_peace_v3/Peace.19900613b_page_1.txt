A colleague lpfer informed me that
he had beapaware of the fact that I

was to by fired before this was re-

Many other questiong{n this regard

that because of Yle discrepancy be-

sub-editors pagement had to fire
one sub-edjior in arderto give a
salary increase of RSO to ach re-
porter.

The company’s high Maff tumover

indiscriminate Afring and firing’ is

disturbing. Dis policy creates an at-
mospherpf instability in the work-
ing enylfonment and inaccurity among
taf¥employed by this establishment.
lt would appear that the problem here
is not 90 much the quality of sorvice
but the financial gituatian of the
newspaper. It isa pfly thal instead of
trying to solve problems in a more

Police dilemma

1 WONDER why you (Ms Gwen
Lister) and some of your staff soek

to discredit the gov-
emmant of the ofNamibis.
1 refer to the le ‘Pepsi Boys -
Lively Lions share the spoils’ writ-
tea by Conrad Angula on May 28.
The statements implying that the
Namibian police are discriminating

against sports lovers on the basis of
colour are not only unfounded but
aleo irresponsible. .

Tam convinced that you would make
a significant contribution toward
feconcilistion and to peace and ete-
bility, if you order your reporters not
to accept the version of ‘one furious
Spectator’ about the policy of tho
government of the actions of the police,
but rather to check such allegations
and emotive utterances with the rele-
vant authorities.

Seeing that Mr Angula has a high
office in soccer circles, I would rec-
ommend that he initiates a meeting
between soocor administrators and
the police to work out ways and
Means to ensure that soccer specta-
tore can enjoy the game in peace and
secunty. At such a meeting the po-
lice will explain their position end
their dilemma.

Please contribute towards the good
efforts of the Namibian Government
to ensure law and order and to effect
meaningful reconciliation, by not
discrediting a govemment depart-
ment just for the sake of an own
political motive.

WINDHOEK

Note: Brigadier Eimbeck, you have
opposed this newspaper and all it
stands for, since its inceptian. You
even apposed the registration of The
Namubsan wa swor statemont, say-
ing that Lister and her political back-
ground proved that the newspaper
would become a ‘threat to state socu-
rity and the maintenance of public
order’. You similarly opposed the
party which pow makes up the gov-
emment of the day. You claim now
to have changed your political view-
point. Well end good. If this is truly
the case then please stop your politi-
cal tactics. Conrad Angula misod a
very legitimate point in the article in
question: namely, the lack of police
presence for as long as we can re
member, at soccer matches, There is
a lot of hooliganism, and violent
incidents, and last weekend was no
exception as you are well aware. On
the other hand, It is an undisputable

ample). You can make your own
comparisons in this regard. Purther,
it is not the job of a reporter to initiate
meetings beteeen the police and soccer
administrators. That's your job. His

. is Co report on events as they occur.

The Namibian supports the idea of a
police force to maintain end uphold
public order. Ite a new concept for
most Namibians who heve in the pest
ecco the police as their enemy (in
most cases, quite righuy 90) since the
latter have acted against political
opponents in mo gt cases. So its up to
the police to prove the mselves to the
public in order to eam their trust aod
confidence.

Lastly, Brigadier, don't make such
laughable statements such as ‘‘ why
you and some of your staff seek
Opportunities to discredit the gov-
emment of the Republic of Namibia’’.
You know quite well that this is not
the issue here. - Gwen Lister.
