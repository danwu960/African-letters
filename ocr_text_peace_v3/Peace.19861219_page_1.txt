' THE ISSUE of the increase of water:
_and electricity in the Caprivi is
creating some division among the
people. The one group is prepared to
spend every cent they have on these
tates, and the other group is reluc-
— tant to do so.
. The thing is that repairs on taps,
— toileta, bathroom drains and even in-
let pipes are ineffectively done, thus
resulting in the wastage of kilolitres
of water. I wonder why the
maintenance office are so interested
in the number of kilolitres rather
than the number of repairs to the
“water'system.

I believe every official working for
a certain authority is a civil servant
and thus entitled to the benefits due
to civil servants, but one wonders
when one sees in the Caprivi that
some civil servants are given about
500 units of electricity free of cHarge,
while the other group of civil ser-
vants have to pay for i’.

The one group gets all the
privileges, while the other-group is
suffering. Is this what the Namwi_
Foundation calls cooperation and
peace? This is rather the promotion
of discriminatory hatred among the
people.

Unless certain people start to work
for the interests of the majority, then
they can forget about cooperation and
peace of mind among the suffering
majority. |

I would therefore suggest that ir-
ritating things are done away with,
Buch aa the increase in

Yatea for water and electricity, with
_ purposeful disregard for the coet of
living; the withholding of workers in-
_ crements and the ineffective
