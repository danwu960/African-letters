To the Generals

‘DURING the years of illegal occupa-
tion by South Africa, I, as a resident
of Suidethof, had problems with the
armed forces living next door to me.
The officer commanding the base
lived across the road from my home,
and every time a black person en-
tered my premises, he would give me
a ‘show of force’ and spit in the strect
to show his resentment.

Every Friday moming one would
bear sergeant majors shouting at ‘sleg
troepe’ refusing to polish their boots

or behaving ina disorderly fashion in

public, Later a certain so-called
coloured battalion moved in and the
wbuse contined. Being a keen gar-

Gener in those days at six in the

‘acting I received a whole run-down

Y events for free.

into suburbia became the main high-
way for the amy.

Then they began to use a siren for
waking up the troops.

My constant calls to vinually
everyone in the army led to me be-
conung very unpopular with the
Windhock-based military. But the
siren system) was eventually aban-
doned.

On independence | stood in my
garden and spat in the street as the
commander moved out to South
Africa!

But my ulusions of peace were
shattered when the UN moved in,
and among others, the Kenyans in-
sisted on being physically fit and
taking the battalion for a run down
Palm Street every moming. Every
white-owned dog in the area went
bananas, as the troops ran past in
heavy boots.

But my story has not ended...

Two weeks ago, after a heavy Fn-
day night, I fell into bed, and at
O5h00 my nightmare began. Out of
the base came the deep wail of a
bombing siren. I leapt from my bed
and jumped for my pants, images of
Kassinga and Ngiva pounding in my
head. I stumbled onto the lawn ex-
pecting chaos, but it was only the
troops being woken up.

Nothing has changed. The base is
stil there, slap~bang in the middle of

suburbia. In the early momings, the
air-raid siren goes off.

Could T make a suggestion: tha
whoever goes on duty at the base
knocks on bungalow doors to wake
up troops, or gets the troops to wake
themselves up! Please, this is not
war-tom Angola but good old Suid-
erhof suburbia. As a homeowner near
the base, T ask those in charge to
show consideration for residents.

In the past we canvassed against
military bases in residential areas,
and while the former rulers were not
sympathetic, we would have thought
that our new Government would be
more considerate.
