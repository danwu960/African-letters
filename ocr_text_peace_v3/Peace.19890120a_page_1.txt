Unchain our brain

IF we have all unchained our brams,
then let us be vigilant and recognise
what our ancestors have done. Let us
unite, because we know thal through
unity we are able to maintain our
independence.

We must not all our brains to be
chained, and we should rather liber-
ate our motherland/

I appeal to all in this country,
including stooges, to unchain their
brains and liberate Namibia. We want
the maintenance of human nghts,
freedom, equality and adequate edu-
cation.

We want to do away with the sys-
tem of apartheid, and bury it where it
can never be found again.

It is clear that ‘there was never a
good war or a bad peace’, yet it is
better to die on one's feet than live on
one's kneews.

We all know that apartheid is like
Aids in Namibia: our people have
diced and are dying because of this
disease.

I hope that in the course of 1989 we -
can achieve our independence, shake
off colonialism, and bring about a
Swapo Government under Sam
Nujoma. I want Mr Nujoma to gov-—
ern the whole of Namibia including
Walvis Bay. Without the inclusion
of Walvis Bay, Namibia cannot be
independent.

I] call on those Namibians who
have been collaborating, to drop the

South African government and its

police forces and join the national

movement, Swa

We must give full support to Swapo,
becausc Swapo is the people of
~ Namibia and the people are Swapo.
