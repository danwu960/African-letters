Whose AK-47â€™s?

I WISH to raise a strong appeal tothe
South African army to withdraw from
~ Namnbian territory.

It appears they are hereto harass, in-
timidate and oppress innocent and
peace-loving Namibians.

As a member of Swapo anda Youth
League activist, ] condemn the latest
deeds of the army and police in the
Katutura hostel.
