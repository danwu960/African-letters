Africa Motherland - Have We Lost Direction?

A Reflection On Laurent Kabila And Other New Age Leaders In Africa

AS we near the 21st century, we as
Africans are confromted with many
questions as to what the future holds
in store for us as ciuzens of the
black continent. Indeed. we are
Pondering this in the wake of recent
happenings on the continent: It is
safe to say that there 1a Common

have failed miserably in shaping
the future of ther own people and
the continent as a wholc.

With Ghana's attainment of in-
Kwame Nkrumah had

farther to say, “Seck ye first polin.

powerment or emancipation.” Be-

would still have remained in the
hand of the select few and our at-
tempts at economic self-empower-
tent could have been meaningless.

officials clinging onto their poss.
tons, not allowing for new wWeas
and the resultant progress of the
Nation

Hence, we are faced with the ques.
bon of our nextstep .. how are we to
nd our continent of this bloodshed?
Firstly, the perception of govern-
ance on the part of our current lead-
ers has to be amended. It 1s sad to
note that there are only a few of
our current leaders who show genu-
Ine intentions of making a positive

improvement tw the Irving condi-
bons of their own people. Because
instead of changing the traditional
tunes of politics in Afinca, they are
seemingly happy to continue with
the status quo,

When considering the new age of
leaders one 1. continuously reminded
of Kabila of the Democratic Repub-
Ix of Congo. Shortly after over-
throwing Mobuto Sese Seko. Kabila
was seen as the man of polucal
change and modemisation im the
former Zarre but | had great reserve
about his capabilities.

Kabila has shown that my con-
cems were not without foundabon
since his current refusal to allow the
United Natons invesugation into
the mass killings of Rwandan refu-
gees makes one question his claim
of innocence. When caung such ex-
amples I maantain my stance that the
role of leaders in Afnca needs to be
redefined at all cost.

Furthermore, we are faced with
people such as Arap Moi of Kenya
and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe
who have made it clear thet they will

not easily hand over power to some -
one ebe. This is absard after bow:
these men have nun ther respectrve
countnes for more than s.atecn years.

San: Abacha of Nigena, despite
hav ing overthrown a legaimate gov-
ernment, and taking power through
mulitary coup, 1s apparently try mg to
install ademocraticalty elected gov-
ernment in Srerra Leone. Is that not
what we call double standards of the
highest order? On top of that we
have the OAU and United Nations -
two bodies that continue to play
double standards.

Based on thts analysis Africa can
only be saved by the democratic
elecuon imo power of people with
integrity, vision, Cammutment and
dedication to the cause.

As Africans we musi to look for
what we do not have, Le. peace,
tranquillity and economic empow-
erment, and then continue to stnve
for these admirable qualities in our
society.
