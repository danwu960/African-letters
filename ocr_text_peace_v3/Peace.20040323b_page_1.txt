Bigotry Needs To Be Exposed

AS a matter of principle, Idon't
engage in sub-standard argu-
ments, but there're exceptions,
especially when utterances of
the anti-democratic forces beg
for an appropriate response.

It's high time, brothers and
sisters, that the misguided
elements in our society are taken
totask and their bigotry exposed.

If peace-loving Namibians
remain silent any longer, this
country will got to the monkeys
before we know it.

It seems the anti-democratic
forces are having a good time in
Namibian political life, behav-
ing like extra-terrestrial beings
and becoming more dangerous
every passing day.

They are misusing all avenues
- talk shows, discussion panels,
conferences, etc.

The sad case in point: Mr.
Paulus Kapia’s and Honourable
Petus flonga’s pointed accusa-
tions of the judiciary. They,
deliberately disregard common
sense and logic.

Were they not supposed to
know better? Why, then, did

they - out of their own free will
- choose the road of demago-
guery and hostile agitation? Is
that their only “trick” todiscredit
the judiciary in general, and
Judge Elton Hoff in particular?

Another sad case in point is
Mr. Jordan Atshipara’s letter
(Judge Hoff's judgement
disappoints - Namibian 9/3/
2004).

At one point he says: “The
charges remain: the accused
allegedly planned and declared
war against the Government of
the Republic of Namibia. Were
we supposed to sit back with
our tails between our legs, while
our hard-eamed peace is being
disrupted and our country being
destabilised?”

And I say: You missed the
point altogether. The case before
Judge Hoff was not one of high
treason but one of unlawful
extradition. Even if itwas acase
of “alleged” high treason that
remains an “allegation” to be
tested in a competent court of
law (not a kangaroo court or
something!).

He says: “We all know the
results of war... those who want
tosecede the Capnivi....!€found
guilty - should rot in jail.”

And I say: So! There is still a
possibility of them being found
guilty - wait ull then!

He asks: “But were Judge
Hoff and his court blind and
deaf the day when he ruled that
return of the 13 to Namibia
violated some intemational laws
and procedures guiding
extradition?

Which procedures did the 13
follow when they allegedly
carried out their attack at Katima
Mulilo? Why should we follow
some procedures by bringing
misguided elements to be tned
back home?”

And I say: It seems we are
dealing with an arrogant misgui-
ded element who believes that
the State should not follow
proce-dures simply because
alleged terrorists did the same,
ah?

He asks: “Who is he (Judge
Hoff) to determine the fate and
the interest of the Namibian

nation?”

And I ask: Are you accusing
the Government of bringing
high treason suspects before an
“unknown Judge”, who has no
right “to determine the fate and
interest of the Namibian
nation”?

Come on guys; let's be
serious!

Why not consider the real
causes for the Swapo Party
Government's poor
performance before Namibian
and international courts
(Kasikilif)? Like, for example,
negligent legal advisers,
incompetent State prosecutors,
reckless police investigations
and indefensible violations, by
Government, of existing laws
and regulations?

Anyway, why have laws and
regulations when the likes of
Sackey Namugongo can go on
air and tell the Nation who's
guilty?

Brothers and sisters, the road
to anarchy ts wide open!
