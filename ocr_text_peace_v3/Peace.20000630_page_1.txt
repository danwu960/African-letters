Nam Involved With FAA
For Our People’s Safety

IN recent months, much has been said
about Namibia's involvementin the war
in Angola. Opposition parties, in par-
ucular, have been questioning the legal-
ity of providing logistical support to the
Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) in its
offensive against Unita.

It is common knowledge that since
gaining independence in 1990,
Namibians living along the Angolan
border have been subjected to Unita’s
banditry activities. Their cattle and per-
sonal belongings have been and con-
tinue to be destroyed by Unita bandits.

Itis because of the suffering inflicted
on Namibian civilians near the Angolan
border that the Namibian Government
decided to provide logistical support to
the FAA, in its offensive against Unita.

Whatare the opposition leaders worried
about? The defeat of their long-stand-
ing ally Unita? Aren't the lives of inno-
cent Namibians worth such Protection?
Opposition leaders in this country
should learn that while they where busy
destroying the Katutura Compound and
eating boerewors behind the central
shops in Katutura, the Angolan govem-
meat was offering its territory to Swapo
to fight for this country’s freedom, which
they (the opposition) are enjoying more
than the people who struggled for it.
Moreover, the Battle of Cuito

Cuanavale, which speeded up Namibia's

Don't we therefore owe it to the
Angolan government and its people, to
Assist them in their quest for peace?

There are of course many ways of achiev-
ing peace. Our Prime Minister on Febru-
ary 22 2000 addressed the nation in the
National Assembly and listed all efforts
by the Namibian Government and the
intemational community in achieving
peace in Angola. The role played by
Namibia was no secret. It was public
knowledge just as it currently 1s. Who
didn't know that Unita leader Jonas
Savimbi was invited to Namibia in Au-
gust 1996? All other mectings arranged
with Unita officials were also made pub-
lic.

The excuse that banditry activities are
as a result of the logistic support offered
to the FAA is rather musleading. Unita’s
banditry activities were reinforced by
the fact that Unita is on the run, cut off
from logistical and other supplies which
resulted in sheer desperation and
cnminality.

The Government has a responsibility
{0 protectits citizens, and maintain peace
and stability which is being threatened
as a result of Savimbi's unwillingness to
comply with intemationally brokered
peace agreements for his county.

I, therefore, think that we all owe it to
the Angolan people to assist them in

obtaining genuine Peace and stability in
their country, which otherwise we would
not enjoy as long as Unita continues to
be led by Jonas Savimbi. All We need at
this moment is unity, in order to achieve
Peace in this region. And the oaly solu-
Gon left to achieve peace and stability is
by offering Support where it is most

Let's give Credit where it is due. There
is ing wrong with the Namibian
Government Providing such support. In
fact, such support was long overdue.

stability in its country
