Tb turn instead to a few substantive
points raised in the text:
Why a Constitution before elec-
tions? So that you know what you are
going to get. A constitution is the
skeleton of a country’s political
aystem; the set of parameters within
which the political contest between
parties espousing different ap-
proaches, is regulated. Constitutions
reflect common values, not the
political preferences of a (temporary)

when addressing this point.

The facts are that SWAPO has been
deciared since 1973, by the
General Assembly, tobe the “sole and
authentic representative of the people
of Namibia”. As a consequence of this

and other actions of the Assembly, it
enjoys the status of ‘permanent
observer’ throughout the UN system.

Those who have had the opportuni.
