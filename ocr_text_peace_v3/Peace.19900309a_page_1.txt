Returnee
problems

IN THE name of reconciliation, all
Namibians, irrespective of colour, creed
or political affiliation, are supposed to
tolerate one another and forget about the
past. Contrary to this, most retumnee job
hunters are often told mainly by white
business ‘managers throughout Namibis
that ‘we have no work for terrorists’ or
‘Nujoma should give you jobs’. The type
of language used against poor retumees is
not only abusive but an insult. Do whites |
not see that the winds of change have
armved?

One may say that these are isolated

(incidents, but the fact is that those who are
victims of such practices argue the con-
Irary. All of us are supported to be guided
by reconciliation, but it seems that itis just |
a theoretical term. |

We are of course ina transitional phase
In Our country, and after a few weeks we
will enter another phase. AL this stage we
cannot afford to have clements drunk with
these rotten altitudes in our society. They
must be sternly wamed to Stop insulting
relumees who are also entitled to work be -
Cause they are sons and daughters of this
country. Last month two retumees asked
me to take them to South West Breweries
Ltd to go for job interviews. This was in ac-
cordance with an advertisement which ap-
peared in a daily paper of the same day, |
They were treated badly by Mr P von

Kuehne at the Human Resources Depart-
ment of the Breweries.

To add insult to Injury. the same Mrvon
Kuehne asked the two people questions
such as whether they spoke French. One
wonders what this had 10 do with working
at the Breweries. People like this are poi-
soning the spirit of reconciliation.

President Nujoma noted when officiat-
ing the launch of the lraining of the first
black troops who will serve as @ guard of
honour on independence day that every.
body should forget the past, and that
Namibia was not the only country where
people had fought Against one another.
Europe had experienced two wars, and yet
the same nations were now striving for a
united Europe, he said.

Wo ‘thought this and other reconcili-
atory slatements made by President
Nujoma and other loaders would set an

society who don't want to fo tthe

Reconciliation should boa 1wo- way

nother and build our unity on the founda.
Uons of reconciliation, love, peace ind
