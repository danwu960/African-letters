IAM a twenty-year-old black

Nangbia. But despite my colour,
there is something about some
black Namibians which hurts
me deeply, and that is the use
of the word ‘boere’ regarding

white Namibians.

In the name of Christianity,

humanity and democracy, let

|

us stop it

This little word is furthering
hostility and suspicion instead
of peace and unity.

Even some of our leadi
Ministers are guilty of this. As
our leaders, I expect them to
help peace and democracy,
simply by stopping from use
of this word, The word is busy
