Churches and radical change

THE CHURCH is the body of
Christ and it is the responsibility of
the church to act in the spiritual,
social and political interests of the
community.

The Church should acknowledge
that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is to
be understood, not only in an ec-
chesiastical sense, but also in the
social, political and cultural sense.

The task of the Church is to work
for God's reconciliation everywhere.

The Church has a responsibility to
reject government policies which
deny people their human rights and
it must speak out against injustice
and preach the Christian message of
peace, freedom and reconciliation.

It should reject racial discrimina-
tion and racism and put forth renew-

ed efforts to live according to Biblical
norms. It should press the govern-
ment to promote fundamental
human rights, freedom and peace
among the people.

The Church is responsible for the
welfare of its people. It cannot re-
main uninvolved because the peopte
under the government are also
members of the church.

The Church has to realise that the
situation in this country is contrary
to the will of God. It has to struggle
for radical change in our society - for
genuine independence for Namibia.
