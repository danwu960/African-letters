Down With Hate Speech

PROMPTED by the publication of ...
“instances of hate speech” by the National
Society of Human Rights in our media
allow me to pass some comments, and
express my personal opinion on this very
serious issue.

I don't think it would be necessary to
write or explain more about the grave
consequences of hate speech. It’s all
well known and documented in places
like Bosnia (the country of my birth) and
Rwanda.

I have to mention that for many years |
used to live under two, which I would call
“evil systems”, being communism and
apartheid respectively.

However evil the two were, none of the
two allowed hate speech to be directed
towards other nationalities or races. Under

the communists, hate speech even heavily
punishable by the law.

Here in Namibia where the building of ;
“one Namibia one Nation” and reconcili-
ation should be the priorities for the sake
of peace and stability.

We have destructive elements among
the democratically elected public figures,
like some government officials and union
leaders, who are by their speeches finding
it very difficult to connect their mouths
with their brains.

What makes matters even worse, their
speeches are broadcasted, over and over,
in most of our spoken languages.

Even winning by 99% of votes, no
government can claim for itself to be
transparent and democratic if it allows
the rights of minorities to be disrespected

and violated.

However, NBC and other instigators of
racial hatred in our society didn’t achieve
anything so far and hopefully this will be
so in the future. 1, as a white Namibian,
can still walk freely in any of the “black
residential areas” without fear of racial
motivated attacks.

If Namibian fallen heroes, who died for
a multiracial society and justice in this
country, could now hear what comes out of
the mouths of Kapenda and Kapia, believe
me, they would turn in their graves.

My sincere congratulation goes to all
peace loving Namibians on their shown
maturity and tolerance.
