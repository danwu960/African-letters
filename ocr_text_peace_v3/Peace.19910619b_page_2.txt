main socalled iNamaland, the
Damaras were thrown away in
the barren western region, the
Hercros to the barren cast and
north-east. Let it be known to
those who don’t know or pre-

tend not to know that no amount
of money or political manoeu-
vering will stop the quest for
the regaining of our traditional
pastures.

We did not forget the past.
We shall never do so, We want
our land back. They never
bought it from us. They inter-
change money to our debit and
continued misery and poverty.
We are not asking for a fair
distribution of land. We want
it all back,

Why, Ms Editor, do you think
that the majority of Namasand
Damaras are the pooreat to-

day? Simply because they are
the most destitute people sinc}:
