against women and in
some instances men, and
by doing this save char-
acter and face. | for one
have noticed and beamed
that being potonous, es-
pecially io Katutura,
bonourns you with respect
from the socety you Live
ut for an example, being
a chag brings you all the
beaunful girls, as op-
posed t bong a law-
abeding teenager or cru-

rea.
Coming beck to our
sceaano, for Anyman
With Fists to be re-
Spected and accepend mn

wards bes onfe.

ft is the same with
cnaninel-mca, especially
boyfriends who beat, as-
saul and even thresticn
uber girifnends with
death, to regard the vio-
babon of buonan ngbo,

For the criminal-
minded men, when they

ever-extended family
that will excuse che as-
seultby commanding the
victims to keeprtpnet and
even withdraw cases? Do.
they rely on the ineffec-
bveoeas of the police
force on the reluctance
of the police officers to
carry out they dunes?

What society are we
living m7 Is it a society
that condones violence,
a society thal respect
comunals, disregards hu-
man integrity? What
kind of people can allow
themselves to be ruled
by crmunals and then yust
voll over and accept it?
What man in his nght
miod can blackmail
women and children and
continuously abuse
them?

Who has the answers
and why don't they give
thers to us? Are women

going to be kept hostage
by cominal-cunded men
of has the socsety cast a
bhnd eye on the pain in
flicted upon itset? Ls
Namibian society going
to groom Anyman With
Fists’ in the future?
Like 1 tad before, |
don't have answers, pust
questions thet are very
s0On to tum me into a
criminal. If the system
fasls to protect the umo-
cent, let the very same
system NOt pursue inno-
cent people who cannot
accept the injustroes they
arc suppressed with ona
daily basis The pavence
of many of the Law-abed-
ing ciuzens of Namib
1S running low, as we
have no confidence in
the law system or the po-
lhecing system We arc not
going to be quiet for

much longer

We're Brothers,
we're happy and

we re coloured,
