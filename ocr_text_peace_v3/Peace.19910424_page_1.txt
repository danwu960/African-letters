'Mbotsotsos'

[WOULD hike to air my views
regarding the statement by
Police Commissioner Siggi
Eimbeck in which he criticised
residents of Katutura of hav-
ing killed two members of
“mbotsotso”.

I make state categorically
that it is regrettable. that the
Commissioner made such a
etatement, regarding people
taking the law into their own
hands.

Even though Namibia is an
, state, people are
gt Gee to move hers and there.

Yet the police accuse people
who live among bad elements,
for killing them in defending
an elderly man. You should
not blame people whose aims
are to do away with cnminals
in this coyatry. Rather take
steps agaizist the criminals.

The houses where these bad
elements are staying are well-
known to everybody, the po-
lice included. The “mbotsotso"
should not be allowed to take
the law into their own hands
and disturb peace and stability
in this country. Moreover, we
are aware of those who col-
laborate with the mbotsotso”’.

The reason why Katutura
residents decided not to fold
their arms and watch their
beloved fellow citizons being
killed by “mbotsotsos” is
because if they are brought
before justice they will proba-
bly be granted bail or acquitted
by a court of law.
