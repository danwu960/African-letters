US scrambles
for Africa

I BELIEVE IN Jimmy Cliff's song,

which says ‘Meeting in Africa’.

Iam referring to today’s news me-
diain which President Ronald Rea-

gan and his Secretary of State, Mr
George Schultz, revealed they back
and support the rebels, as South
Africa has confirmed that it supports
Renamo with food and ammunition,
in order to stage a coup on the Freli-

mo and MPLA Governments.

In the face of the world, Ronald
and George have declared war on the

Government of Angola by support-
ing Unita, a rebel movement. Is this
not another Afghanistan-type crisis?

Hardly a week before the meeting
between Gorbachev and Reagan in
Geneva, Reagan openly challenged
Gorbachev with his support for

Unita.

The military position of the
Americans and its Star Wars defence

programme clearly ignores the im-
portance of the Third World.

Were the talks between the USSR
and the USA leading to Armaged-

don, which inthis case is Angola? If

the Angolan Government calls upon

Russia for support, who can blame

them, but the cowboy administration
in Washington?

Ronald and George’s administra-
tion is going to support Unita

throughtheSouthAfrican Defence

Force, which is already doing that,

[would liketoinformboth Reagan
and Schultz that they have actedcon-

trary tothe interests of world cace,

and that they aye ilso: violatin g hu U
