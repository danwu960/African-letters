When Headmen March On 4th Term

THE recent marching of Swapo kings and head-
men is a wrong move. It's a pity that our people,
when they are in numbers supporting the same
idea, think they are right. They think that means
“one Namibia, one nation”. What we must think
of is what the fourth term means for us as Namibian
nation, not to make one man bappy. What is the
extent of its advantages and disadvantages? The
fourth term is costly. It will lead to more hunger
and poverty. Peace can never be maintained by an
individual human being, unless it is deserved by
all.

The demanded referendum is an additional
election. Where will the millions of dollars come
from? Will the nation be sacrificed again for an
individual advantage and benefit? Are we really
serious? To change the constitution to allow a
fourth term means money (millions). This burden
will be put on the already suffering Namibian

and hence we have a very limited time, die to the
lack of funds, for the re-registration of élections.

The money will be misspent as we still have a
high unemployment rate in the country and those
in the recent youth service scheme from
Grootfontein could be employed. Or is it Swapo
party that will fund the referendum?

The extent of love within a human being is the
same as hatred. Chiluba in Zambia is an example
of the peoples’ turning point from love to hatred.
Next, the same people who are chanting. “We did
not sleep, we want Sem_.blah, blah”. They will
call for prosecution after they discovered the dis-
respect of our country’s constitution by him and
the misuse of our country’s limited resources for
individual benefit. Which reasons will they give
and what difference will they make between the
current President and his successor who will be
demanding a third and fourth term? He will also
be liked and supported by a majority like Neison
Mandela and Bill Clinton. It is the same type of
people who will march again then.
