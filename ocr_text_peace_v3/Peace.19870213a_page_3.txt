while preaching socialism. The peo-
ple should be prepared for the Great
Socialist Revolution which is going
to tranaform the entire Namibian
society. 7

Namibian masses must stand
together and cal] and end to the op-
preasion meted out to you. If the
leaders are not taking any initiative,
then you are at liberty to take actions
to liberate the country. Let us make
1987 the final year of our struggle for
independence.

We have been hearing about peace
and reconciliation in Namibia ..
what a misuse of words and terms.
The fact is there is no peace in
Namibia and there won't be peace in
Namibia unless the enemy is driven
out and we resume our rightful place
and control of our country. There
won't be reconciliation in Namibia
between the oppressed and op-
pressors. What are we reconciling?
Oppression? No way. The real peace
and reconciliation will come when
the black man has come to hia rights
and power. We cannot talk about
peace and reconciliation in Namibia
unleas we are trying to bluff
ourselves as the white liberals are do-
ing today. To the white liberals we
say: you cannot achieve or solve
anything by working with your pup-
pets or tamed blacka. The key to the
solution of the Namibian problem
lies with the true blacks ... the
revolutionaries, We are holding the
key to peace, freedom and tranquili-
ty in Namibia, ee
