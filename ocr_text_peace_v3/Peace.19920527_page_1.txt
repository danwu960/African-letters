What might
have been

ONCE upon a time there was
acountry in Afncacalled Ba-
sibia. Basibia had a small
population. Most of its people
were peor in terms of money
but nch in spirit.

For many years Basibia was
tuled by a colonia: power.
The officials in the colonial
government paid themselves
high salaries while the people
starved, robbing Basibia of
its wealth for their own bene-
fit. But the people of Basibia
were suong. For many years
they fought against colonial
tule under BAPPA, the Ba-
sibian Peoples Party. After a
long and painful struggle,
Bastbia finally won its inde-
pendence. Now the Basibian
people were free to shape their
own nation.

“Now we can be just like
other nations in Africa”, said
some of the people. “Oh no”,
said others, “we must learn
from our brothers and sisters.
We will follow ther successes
and avoid their mistakes”.

Basibia adopted a
consbtrution that was admired
all over the world because it
made Basibia a true democ-
racy.

BAPPA swept to victory in
Basibia’s first election as an
independent nation because
it promised to live up to its
name as a people’s party. Its
election posters said ‘United
We Stand, Divided We Fall’
and ‘Build a New Basibia for
all Basibians’.

The leader of BAPPA be-
came the first President of
Basibia. He loved the people
of Basibia and was much loved
by them.

“We are all Basibians to-
gether”, he said. “Every man,
woman and child in this na-
tion is my family, and I will
not rest while any of ny people
are suffering”.

“That is fine”, said some of
the members of BAPPA, ‘but
now we must talk about our
salaries. To keep the peace,
we have promised all the gov-
emmment employees who were
hired before independence that
their salaries will not be re-
duced. So we must pay our-
selves at least as much as
they are getting, of perhaps
even more”.

“No”, said the President
“those people were robbing
our country. Why should we
follow in their footsteps? Be-
cause we work for the gov-
emment, we are given houses
to live in while many of our
people are homeless. The state
even gives us pensions and
medical aid. We will pay
ourse!ves modest salaries. And
I have State House to live in
and a government Car to travel
in - I will be well taken care
of. My salary must be the
lowest of all”.

“But, Comrade President”,
the others cried, “you can’t
do that. You are the father of
the nation. Surely your salary
must be the highest. No leader
of any other country would
do such a thing”. .

And the President replied
“You say that [ am the father
of ous nation - what father

the world!”

The neat day some of the
President's advisors came to
talk to him about cars for the
government. “Of course,
Benz's”, they said. “The Ba-
sibian people would like to
see us in cars that will suit our
status as leaders”.

“No”, said the President, ‘I
do not think so. We willneed
transport, but we must save
as much money as possible
for developing our nation. No
one working in this govern-
ment is going to drive a fancy
car”.

“But Comrade President”,
they said, “all the highest
government officials before
independence drove expen-
sive cars. And so do Heads of
State all over the world!”

“Yes”, said the President

“but we will be different. We
will set an example. A true
leader does not separate
himself from the people. You
must remember that most of
the people of Basibia cannot
afford a car at all. Find us
some inexpensive cars that
will get us where we need to
go”.
“Now, Comrade President’,
said the advisors, “we need to
build a new place for Parlia-
ment to meet”

“But why?”, said the Presi-
dent. ‘Is there no place where
we can gather to do our work?’

“Yes”, they said, “but it is
old and dingy and we will be
crowded there. We want a
fancy room with a new carpet
and leather chairs”.

“No”, said the President, ‘1
will not spend any money on
government buildings until
every single person in our
nation has a home to live in.
Until thatday, we must get by
with what we have”.

The next day the President's
advisors were back again.
“Comrade President”, they
said, ‘we will have to make
many trips to other counmes.
We must share ideas and
discuss issues and make agree-
ments with the people of other
nations”.

“This is true”, said the Presi-
dent, ‘we moust do some tav-
elling. But we must always
think of saving money. None
of my ministers will fy first
class, and we will always stay
in the cheapest hotels”.

“But Comrade President”,
they said, ‘‘a government min-
ister must travel in style. You
would not want your minis-
ters to be crowded and un-
comfortable”.

And the President said “how
can you talk about being
crowded and uncomfortable
when I have seen some of our
people living in the single
quarters, 10 and 20 people
sleeping in one tiny room,
every night of their lives?”

“But what about you, com-
rade President?”, they said,
“you must have your own
plane for efficiency and secu-

simplest plane that can take
moe where I need to go. A true

leader does not separate
himself from the people. We
are going to set an example to
the world”.

It was not long before a
delegation came from Parlia-
ment to visit the President.
“Comrade President’, they
said, ‘this cannot continue.
We are Basibia’s leaders. We
fought for independence and
now we deserve our reward”.

“Yes”, said the President,
“but we did not fight alone.
Would any of us be here in
government today if we had
not had the support of our
people? All Basibians deserve
the reward of a new Basibia
where all can prosper”.

“But, comrade President”,
they said, ‘‘no other country
in the world operates this way.
We will be the laughingstock
of Afnca”.

“No”, said the President, “T
think you are going to be sur-
prised”.

And it was not long before
anew spirit came to Basibia -
a spint of giving and sharing.
Government ministnes held
competitions to see which ones
could save the most moncy.
Some of the civil servants who
had been hired before inde-
pendence were so embarrassed
about their high salaries that
they asked for salary cuts.
Even private citizens sold their
fancy cars because it was so
unfashionable to be seen in
them.

And the government spent
money on health care and
education and literacy train-
ing and development projects
and social security payments
for the old and unemployed.
It was not long before the
standard of living of every
single person in Basibia had
risen. No one was hungry.
Children were healthier.
Everyone in Basibia had a
home, and almost everyone
could read. And the govern-
ment had been so careful with
its money that Basibia was
not dependent on foreign aid.
Basibia was truly free.

The Presiden: was respected
and admired more than any
other leader in any country in
the history of the world. Alt
over Basibia people said “A
true leader does not separate
himself from the people”. They
voted for BAPPA again and
again, and Basibia remained
peaceful and prosperous.

And soon Basibia was fa-
mous. No other nation had
ever dared to be so different.
Visitors came streaming in
from all over the world to sce
this remarkable place. New
investors were attracted [0
Basibia because it was SO
unique. People in every land
recognised the wisdom of the
President of Basibia and he
was awarded many honours
(which he always accepted in
the name of all Basibians).

Basibians had once said
“We must be like all other
countries”. Now people in

ae abe aoe ree

othercountries said ‘‘we want
to be like Basibia”’.

And that is how one small
nation began to change the
world

ANON

The jet outcry

IT has never been part of my
culture to engage myself in
public debates which are being
over-emphasised for political
gain.

In the face of the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an R80 mil-
lion jet for the Government
and officials of the Republic
of Namibia, I was faced with
several questions which I could
not help to answer.

I fully concur with the fact
that our country faces oumer-
ous problems, some short term
and others long term. Take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane.

Now the queston is whether
it is true that those ‘Muyon-
gos’ who presuppose that the
R80 million could have been
better spent if used for rehef

programmes, are more sensi-
tive to the realities in Na-

mibia? If so, how far back
have they (Muyongos) been
$0 critical about the way in
which taxpayers’ money has
been spent for the purchase
of things such as Casspirs and
Mirages by their regime, the
former interim government?

Or, does Muyongo wantus
to believe that the money mis-
used on the purchase of war
material at the ume of their
rule was less than R80 mil-
lion? And was it not taxpay-
ers’ money?

This country has inherited
a debt which it has to repay
due to the misuse of funds
and the criminal war which
was imposed on our people.
Again, does Muyongo want
us to accept that the drought
and other social evils in our
country today are new hap-
penings? I assume not.

Unemployment, hunger, to
mention but a few, are the
legacy of the past history of
the country. Even at the time
of successive colonial regimes,
the problems were there.

As these problems did not
prevent them (the Muyongos)
from purchasing wanton war
materials which ran to bil-
lions of Rands which this
country is left to repay today,
likewise, should these pre-
vent the legitimate govemn-
ment from purchasing a plane
which will enable the Presi-
dent and other Government
officials to maintain contacts
with the outside world for the
benefit of the people of this
country?

* Even if the plane were not
purchased, could there be
someone who would come
up with a formula which would
