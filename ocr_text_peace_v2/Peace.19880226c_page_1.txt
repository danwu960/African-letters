aernagainst Bwape srdthe poople of
Namibia. South Africa through its
puppets and mase media continue to
deceive and mislead Namibians as to
the true situation in our country.

- I feel deeply hurt at the loss of lives
of innocent civilians at Oshakati. it is
not the first time that the people of
Namibia are intimidated, harrassed
and killed by the racists of Pretoria.

Who was responsible? There are
many instances as examples; 1981
bomb blast at Oshakati Post Office, for-
tunately noinjuries; 1998 bomb blagt
at Okatana service Station, killing two
Americans and a loca] businessman,
Mr Nakambonde; 1985 bomb blast at
Ondangwa Poet Office, killing many
people including children; 1985 bomb

blast atthe Ongwediva Training Cen-
tre, fortunately no casualties; 1996 s0-
meone tried to plant a-bomb at Mr
Frans Indongo’s Continental Super-
market, fortunately he wascaught red-
‘handed and felt very ashamed; 1986
security forces tried to a bomb fdr
CDA President Peter Kalangula, but
this too failed.
Further still, there are many, many
Namibians who have either been kill- |
edor whodisappeared,andlamciting
the following examples; Mathias
Ashipembe, David Sheehama,
Fillemon Elifas, Joseph Dumeni and
many others. These are merely some
examples of atrocities committed by
South Africa against the people of |
Namibia, and for which Swapogetsthe |
blame. |
Many Namibiansdo not have homes
or property any more, as these have
been destroyed by the racist’s Casspirs.
Swapo has never committed any such |
act against the people of this country,
| which we cannot say about South:
Africa. Racist South Afriea is to he
blamed for numerous atrocities
against Namibians, and Icalluponthe
: international community to quickly
