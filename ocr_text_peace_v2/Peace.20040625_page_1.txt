Poor Planning In Boeing Purchase

KINDLY allow me space in your
newspaper to air my views on what
] see as an issue which should
concern all true patriots as well
as taxpayers in this country, the
purchase of the Boeing 747 Combi
by Air Namibia.

First let me thank the government
of the Republic for its commitment
todevelopment.I cannot enumerate
all its achievements because there
are so many. Let me also say that I
have no doubt that the government
wishes to see things moving in this
country, after all that is what we
fought for. To return to the Jumbo

Jet, I think, keeping quiet on this
issue would be tantamount tosaying
Icould not care less about the future
of this country. As a citizen, I feel it
is my duty not to allow what I see
as imprudent financial decisions to
continue to be made.

When one looks at the financial
quagmire into which the Combi
has dragged Air Namibia, they
would not think that it was the same
plane that brought the ‘feel- good
factor’ in some quarters upon its
purchase. I trusted that those who
make decisions onour behalf would
be careful not to pour public money

down the drain by engaging in what
seems to bea not-well-thought
through purchase.

The reasons advanced for the
lack of viability of the Boeing
makes one wonder whether proper
procedures that purchases of that
magnitude require, had been fol-
lowed prior to the purchase. In my
book, there seems to be indications
of lack of sound economic think-
ing in the purchase of the Combi.
Consequently, to put my mind at
peace regarding the purchase of
the Boeing, Air Namibia should
answer the following questions:

Was any investigation conducted
to determine the viability of the
Boeing? If it was, why are we now
being told that the Combi's carry-
ing Capacity and its maintenance
make ita financial burden? Did not
the study address these and other
pertinent issues?

Comrades, let us admit that the
purchase of the Boeing 747 was a
squandering of government money,
money which could have been put
to use somewhere else. In my
view, this kind of practice will in
the long run undermine the govern-
ment and therefore to deter this

kind of spending of public funds
in future, somebody must be made
accountable for this shameful
blunder.

If you want me to believe other-
wise, convince me that the decision
to purchase the plane in question
was based on scientific investi ga-
tions the results of which were
positive. And therefore the current
financial crisis is not a result of poor
planning. The question is: Have we
learnt any lessons?
