powestine. Altematively, if be,
for some reason, was unable to
design such a system, only then
should he have asked the SADF
or Kocvoet to regularly patrol
soch ;

The steel pylons are ex-
tremely expensive and each
power pylon costs at least R10
000. And 400 would cost R4-
million. Also it is extremely
expensive and dangerous to
remove those moves. Can you,
as an engineer, guarantee that
no human life or pylon will be
destroyed in the process of
removing the mines, Mr
Hooggenbout? How much did
Swawec pay the SADF to
remove such mines?

If they had not been your
mines, Sir, then such R3 400
00 could have been used in the
trauning and re-training of ‘non-
white’ Namibians in order to
meet the letter and spint of
Article 23 (1) of the constitution.
