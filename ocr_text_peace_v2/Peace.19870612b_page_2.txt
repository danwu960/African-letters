thee AKT you have confiscated?
‘We are iiot all children and cannot be
fooled. Perhaps those in the Tinten-

_ palast and Pretoria can be fooled, but
not ts.

The subsequent police press con-

ference was a total distortion of the

_ truth. There the police claimed that
“we have no knowledge of any assaults
committed by members of the police or
‘security force members during the
operation. That is rubbish and we have
evidence that people such as Linus.
Shipingana and others were assaulted
while looking at police from the cor-- |
ridors of their room when thay were |
awakened. |

I also wish to condemn in the

strongest of terms the confiscation of
property of compound residents. How
can they confiscate things like knives
or kieries. We are allowed to possess
these things, and nobody needs a per-
‘mit to buy or keep the ct meet
ed items either for ho self
