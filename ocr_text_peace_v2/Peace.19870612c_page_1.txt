” Swapol, also known as Koevoet, seem
_to believe that physical violence will
“change our viewsas Namibiansin this

country.

I and two comrades, living in the
Katutura compound, were assaulted
by drunk membersof Swapol on April
15 (a Wednesday) after midnight at the
Rasta Funk Disco.

Why do members of these forces at-
tack innocent Namibians? Were they
appointed to maintain law and order
or not?
| Are they trained in the right way? Or

are they trained to hit and kick inno-
cent people? Shouldn’t they be helping
us against trespassers of the law?

It seems that many of those people
are cowardly rather than brave, and
this is why they attack innocent
a vere ratherthan delinquents.
