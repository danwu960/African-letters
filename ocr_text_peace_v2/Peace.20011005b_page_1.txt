Who Are The Real Terrorists?

ALLOW me to express my views in your esteemed
Newspaper. They are in connection with the ongoing
confusion of the Angolan situation with the main news
topic in the international political arena, namely the fight
against terrorism.

[ take this opportunity also to express my condolences
to the American people for the loss of lives on the 11 of
September events.

It is clear by now that the terms terrorist and terronsm
have to be redefined and a consensus to be reached
amongst all that belong to the human race. The way ahead
is challenging but also highly rewarding. Basic justice
and a dignified human life for every inhabitant of the
earth are at stake here. The concerns about state terronsm
should be given the necessary attention. For instance,
enforced disappearance and arbitrary killings of citizens
committed by state authonties should be considered as
acts of state terrorism. A typical example of such as state
in Africa is Angola.

The longest, bloodiest. and most destructive and largely
ignored conflict in Africa 1s being stayed in the beautiful
landscapes, hills and savannahs of Angola. I will refrain
from diving deep into the causes of the civil war that rages
for decades now, for they have been exhaustively cov-
ered. | am going to stick to crucial facts to refresh the
memory of those in oblivion, who still fantasise in giving
to the Angolan ruling party tree hand to continue dect-
mating the Angolan population and plundering the natu-
ral resources. For those, a little piece of advice: forget it.
Or at Jeast, think reasonably all over again. Here are the
facts:

- The MPLA did start the civil war fin 1975;

- The MPLA did cheat the general elections in 1993
and initiated the civil war II;

- The MPLA violated the peace accord of Lusaka 1994

by resuming military operations aimed at total destruc-
tion of Unita (its old sweet dream , by the way).

The MPLA leadership, who successfully metamor-
phosed from demagogic communism to venal capital-
ism, never had the guts, stomach and neither the slightest
desire in the distant past and now to face real opposition
parties. Why? The answer is quite simple: the Angolan
Cake is so awesome, astonishing and magical that it will
constitute a sacrilege to share it with someone else other
than the top few people of the ruling party. Thus the
current tragedy. In this regard the intemational commu-
hity, especially the Western countries that continue to
milk the proverbial wealth of Angola has done very little.
As a result the majonty of Angolan population live in
abject and sordid poverty contrasting, very painfully,
with the unashamed opulent life style of few ruling party
individuals and army generals.

Calling Unita and Dr Savimbi terrorists? And what
about the atrocities committed by the Angolan army
forces, security. the police, and many other paramilitary
organisations underthe patronage and implicit support of
the unqualified and non-elected president JES? Is this not
considered state terronsm?

Can you imagine the number of deaths caused by the
constitutional, military, law and security enforcement
agencies lawlessness. of the so-called Angolan goverm-
ment? Do you have any idea of the death toll caused by
hunger and starvation, lack of health services, uncontrol-
lable banditry and even lack of potable water including in
the capital Luanda itself, derived from the chronic eco-
nomic mismanagement, blatant incompetence, rampant
corruption, nepotism, of the so-called Angolan govern-
ment?
