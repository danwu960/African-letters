Inclusive Dialogue Is Only Angola Solution

MUCH is being said about
Angola but less has been
done to address the root
causes of its long-running
problem. The so-called
peace-loving countries
have not alleviated the
situation but have aggra-
vated it by fuelling the
war with the supply of
arms to warring parties,
sometimes based on bind
loyalty.

To put it briefly: after
the unceremonious with-
drawal of the Portuguese
colonialists in Angola,
there was an historic meet-
ing in Portugal. The three
nationalist movements,
Movement for the Popu-
lar Liberation of Angola
(MPLA), the National
Union for the Total Inde-
pendence of Angola
(Unita) and the National
Front for the Liberation
of Angola(FNLA) signed
the Alvor Accords on
January 15, 1975.

The Alvor agreement
provided for a joint in-
tenm government and in-
tegrated national army.
However, as the date for
military integration
acared, the agreement
broke down. By mid- 1975
the three groups were at
war and the US and Rus-
sta rushed to involve
themselves.

On May 3! 1991 the
Bicesse Accord was reu-
fred, calling for the Gov-
emmment and Unita forces
to integrate into a $0 000
strong military force. The
Accord contained a ‘Tri-
ple Zero’ clause which
prohibited eather party to
the conflict from purchas-
ing ocw weaponry, while
the MPLA remained the
legitimate government,
holding responsibility for
running the state during
an interim period.

Russia had been one of
the three observing
‘Troika’ members in the
peace process. But it has
also long been a suppber
of weapons to Angola.
The Angotan Government
had unul 1998 a S$6billion
debt to Russia, all of itdue
to weapons purchases.
After segotiations in
1998, such debt was re-
duced to about $1,$ mil-
lion. Because of the out-
standing debt, the deal bad
to be funded mainly
through diamond joiat

venture arrangements. as

well as some oil and min-
ing concessions and fish-
ingrights. Kazakhstan has
admitted that in 1998 11
transferred Russian mati-
tary equipment to Angola.

Portugal remains tied to
Angola by its history. Itis
that country’s main noa-
oil trading partner. The
Portuguese government
has always been partisan,
supporting only the
MPLA in spite of its posi-
ton as a member of the
observing ‘Troika’. (Por-
tugal, Russiaand US form
the Troika).

Under the Lusaka Pro-

Li". oa a

he os om i

tocol concluded on No-
vember 39 1994, neither
President dos Samtos nor
Unita’s Jonas Savimbi
signed the agreement,
leaving it to their subordi-
nates to do s0, a sign of
their continued lack of
confidence im the peace
process. The abuse of hu-
maa rights contributed to
the collapse of the Lusaka
accord ia 1998. Serious
violations of the ceasefire
increased io 1997, the
majority of which were
civilians. Human rights
issues remained a sub-text
two the agreement.
