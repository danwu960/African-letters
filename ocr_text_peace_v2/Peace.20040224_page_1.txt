Marching for Africa

PLEASE allow me to
invite interested Africans
to march together for
Africa.

AfricaWise, founded by
Africans who want to do

something for Africa, was

established tocreate Africa
awareness among Africans
wherever they may be in
Africa and the world.
Therefore, all willing-ly
African people in Na-

mibia, in Africa and the
Diaspora are invited to a
long peaceful march for
Africa, forunity, peace and
love in Africa.

Although a petition
calling for an “End to all
conflicts on African soil,

An appeal for faster
unity among African
nations and the return of
people of African ancestry
from the Diaspora back to

Africa” will be signed. The
march is not political, reli-
gious or anti-govern-ment,
but is about bringing toge-
ther different African peo-
ple to march together for
Africa.

The march willtake place
on Sunday, 29 February,
starting at 18h00 from the
KatuturaCom-munity Arts
Centre (KCAC) and
marching all the way to the

Parliament Gardens.

Bring along your
self-written posters or
whatever is African?

All Africans who want
to do something for Africa
are invited and welcome.
