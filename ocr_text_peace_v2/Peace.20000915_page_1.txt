1 READERS’ LETTERS

I READ with interest and
some amusement your
editorial of Friday Sep-
tember 8 2000 on what

letter by echoing the sen-

you referred to as “mud-
dling of words”.

Being a journalist my-
self, I know exactly what
you are talking about. I
have also experienced the
frustration of trying to fig-
ure out the meaning of

sentences and paragraphs
in media releases.
However, I have real-
ised that it can be danger-
ous td make assymptions
on the ground of statements
made in such releases.
Since you referred in
your editorial to a media
release issued by the Min-

Tf "4@ 4 rns

istry of Foreign Affairs,
Information and Broad-
casting, I feel compelled
tO point out to you the
dangers of assuming the
meaning of statements.
You quoted me as saying
that: “The future of the
elephant that attacked the
tourists will be decided
once a fall investigation
into the circumstances of
the incident has been
completed.” From this
you deduced and even
suggested that it would
have been better to

straightforwardly inform
the public that the el-
ephant will be killed.
Youassumption, which
you clearly qualified with
“we think” in brackets,
was wrong. In fact the
Ministry of Environment
and Tourism has already
confirmed, upon the out-
come of the investigation,
that the elephant cow that
was responsible for the
attack would not be killed.
It is, therefore, clear
that your assumed option
was incorrect. The other

options that we consid-
ered were to leave the
animal in peace or to drive
it back to the possible re-
stricted area from where
itescaped, which was not
the case in this instance.
Being aware of at least
three options to be con-
sidered insofar as the fu-
ture of the elephant was

been very irresponsible if
