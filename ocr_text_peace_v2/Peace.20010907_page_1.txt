an colonial army.
y before they were

md i, forces St
cided in that short ses-
‘gion held at their Head-
quarters Schuckmanns-
‘burg to name the region
(Caprivi in addition of the
(existing Itenge name.

. This was decided to
‘have a two-fold connota-

entire Namibia was colo-
nised by Germany. Sec-
londly, with the name
‘ Caprivi intact it was easy

for Germany to reclaim
the entire country back
after the war and review
all signed agreements with
Britain.

A name change for
Caprivi is long overdue;
it was supposed to change
subsequently after inde-
pendence in 1990.
Change is inevitable and
we cannot run away from
it.

Why the name change?

1. The name Caprivi has
no cultural link with
Namibians residing in the
region viz Masubias,
Mafwes, Mayeyis and the
San people.

2. Caprivicuts short the
history of Mafwes,
Masubias, Mayeyis and
the San people whose his-
tory goes as far asthe [5th
century.

3.The scrambling of
African history teaches us

- that most Africans come

from the Great Lakes
where the name Caprivi
never existed, hence it
only came alive in 1915.

4.The name Caprividis-
criminates hence all
Namibians residing there
cannot be called
Caprivian, only those born
there.(note: Caprivi is not
a language but a German
name.)

5.The name Caprivi
promotes rebellion and
secessionism since it im-
plies

Namibians who hail
from that region are from
a country other than the
Land of the Brave.

6. Caprivi assumes the
status of a different coun-
try, hence it is the only
Namibian region that sub-
jugates citizens, viz, we

don’t have Omahekeans,
Ohangwenians nor
Khomasians, why
Caprivians?

7.Caprivi should not be
compared to cities and
towns like Windhoek and
Tsumebd which explicitly
reflect their origin by
name. It is subject to
change without vote or
referendum to suit the pre-
vailing changes and de-
velopment, so as to bring
about pease in the coun-
try. Remember it is one of
the most troublesome re-

gions in the country.
8.The name Caprivihas

nothing in common with

Namibian people.

9.The name Caprivi
could have been a con-
tributing factor to the past
and ongoing tribal con-
flict in the region. Nobody
really knows its real mean-
ing. I'm aware the new
name may not make
Katima Mulilo clean.

10. Caprivi is the only
Namibian region, which
is not indigenous - it has
no historical background

with its people.

The name praises
Caprivi and his father
Zipfel and indeed the en-
tire German people as he-
roes and will continue to
haunt us as long as it ex-

Having said that, my
choice of name is Zam-
bezi Region. It is neutral,
impartial andis Namibia's
major tourist attraction.
Nearly everyone drinks

all live from it either di-

Viva Ndaitwah For Snub At UN Launch

I WOULD be extremely pleased if you could publish
my reaction. I am basically writing in response to an
article which appeared in the Friday (August 31, 2001)
edition of your newspaper titled “Minister snubs UN

launch”.

I think the Minister did the right thing by ignoring the
launch of the so-called human development report. This

Minister should not even agree to talk to them before
they publicly apologise to the nation or publicly ac-
knowledge that this report was a mistake.

If they have no respect for us, there is no reason why
we should show them respect. It must be reciprocal. Is
this how they justify paying themselves hefty salaries
for doing nothing in Namibia? ‘They are redundant i in
