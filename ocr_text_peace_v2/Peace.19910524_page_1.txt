ing. ib was difficult however,
to get work experience in for-
eign countries. In Zambia it
was not possible due to finan-
cial problems; in India it was
dus to the short time of the
contract; and in Germany it
was due to the fact the! many
radio broadcast houses belong
to private companies and those
companies did not support
Swapo, and apparently did not
want to accomodate Swapo
members in ‘sensitive’ areas
such as broadcasting.

[ remember when we asked
our programme coordinator to
arrange an attachment in Ger-
many, be said it was difficult
to get attachments for people
regarded as ‘terrorists’. He
failed to get a permanent at-
tachment and only succeeded
in 8 short period of time at a
small radio studio.

Since we came back to
Nasaibie in 1989 as past of the

process, we have

happen? If there are no vacany
Ges in NBC, why ase’new people
being recruited?

Everyone needs bread for
his or her survival! so that we
can live in peace and hanmoay
in independent Namibia.
