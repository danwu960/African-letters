Giving Praise To A Great Leader

KINDLY allow me space
in your highly esteemed
newspaper to comment on
the opinion piece of Phil ya
Nangoloh which appeared
in the Namibian of April 16,
2004. fam of the opinion that
statements of that nature and
in that fashion should not be
left unchallenged by patriotic
citizens.

Prophets of Doom have
always been there since time
memorial, but the opinion
piece in question does not
only predict a bleak future
for the country but also mis-
lead the readers with regard
to the calibre of President
Sam Nujoma and that of the
Swapo Party of Namibia
lest we forget why Swapo
emerged.

Such statements should be
rejected with the contempt
it deserves by all patriotic
citizens and the international!
friends of Namibia.

The opinion piece created
an impression that our in-
cumbent President is power
hungry, and also misrepre-
sents the facts relating to the
so-called infighting among
the Swapo Party rank and file
with regard to succession and
a lack of democracy in the
structures of the party.

Every movement or or-
ganisation has its power

dynamics and Swapo Party
should not be singled out for
criticism. The recent breaka-
way factions of the Official
Opposition are testimony
that power dynamics exist
in all organisations.

1 would like to state that,
people of Ya Nangoloh’s
calibre should know better
about the political dynamics
in this country and should
lead the illiterate masses to
the truth and not make use
of public platforms and their
knowledge to mislead the
youth and future generations
of tomorrow. Itis unfortunate
to note that right from the be-
ginning when he emerged as
the Director of the National
Society for Human Rights, he
has opposed the Swapo Party
of Namibta, its government
and specifically its President
and poticies.

When one reads between
the lines of what he said
with regard to the Swapo
Party Central Committee
decision to nominate three
candidates for President, not
only of the Swapo Party but
also of the country after Dr.
Sam Nujoma, one gets the
impression that Swapo does
not have democracy and that
all decisions are dictatorially
taken by President Nujoma.

Thisisaclear misrepresen-

tation of what Swapo is all
about and is intended to sow
seeds of doubt and mistrust
in the people but also for
the much needed investors
intending to invest in the
country. One just wonders
who really pulls the strings
of Mr. Ya Nangoloh?

Democracy was brought
in Namibia by Swapo and
its leader President Sam
Nujoma. It has been proven
beyond reasonable doubt at
the formation of the Swapo
Party and recently by the
Swapo Party Central Com-
Mittee meeting of April 2
2004 that the interest of the
nation is far more important
than that of an individual.

I hereby submit that is
has also been proven by
the founding father of the
nation and first President of
the independent Republic of
Namibia io his tast State of
the Nation’s Address that he
will leave office by March 21
2005. with confidence that
the new head of state will
build on the foundation that
we have built collectively.
Let us give praise to a great
leader comrade!

Ya Nangoloh also cites the
State House project to justify
his claims, forgetting that the
project is for the nation and
not for an individual, and as

it was eartier said, “the State
House project should repre-
sent the nation's pride (Not
the current one thal represent
a fallen racist regime of the
former Apartheid South
African administration) and
should be a national monu-
ment for current and future

It is only those who are
patriots, those who compre-
hend, those who are humble
that can appreciate the efforts
of the Swapo Party govern-
Mentto builda national mon-
ument of that magnitude. |
am confident that if] goto the
graves of Mr. Ya Nangoloh’s
parents, I will be able to find
atombstone. Why should all
citizens and a free nation not
have something to relate to,
to be proud of and to identify
themselves with?

T would like to focus on Ya
Nangoloh’s opinion piece in
particular but not limit my-
self to mention that in general
people are out there to mis-
lead the nation. InSwapo we
have learnt to tolerate this,
but I am of the opinion that
they should be opposed and
excluded by all peace loving
and progressive citizens, by
all means possible!

Mr. Ya Nangoloh, the Pres-
ident is not so narcissistic to
fire the cadres that he has

led as you think and suggest
in your opinion piece. The
President will not dissolve
the Parliament to cling to
power, the President is not
Robert Mugabe and for that
matter Namibia is certainly
Not going to take the Zim-
babwe route to resolve the
land issue.

A government should
make decisions that are in
the interest of the nation and
agovernment is mandated by
the electorate to make deci-
sions on their behalf. The
decision to expropriate land
is in the national interest and
inline with the constitutional
provisions. As bona fida
members of the Party, we
expect our leaders to take
action and implement the
Swapo Party Manifestoof the
last elections. Please do not
try to score cheap political
points in this regard.

I would like to thank the
President of the Republic of
Namibia on behalf of those
who argue like me for the
generous contribution he has
made to the future of the Land
of the Brave. Your dedicated
service during the struggle
and after independence will
never be forgotten. Your wise
philosophical saying that,
“a victim never forgets, but
the doer does” is true in the

circumstances.

Those who criticise the
people’s movement Swapo,
and its founding leader today
was part and parcel of the
system that caused a lot of
inequities in all social struc-
tures of the black people.

Mr. Ya Nangoloh’s opin-
ion piece and those that are
similar in content are not
welcome in Namibia, par-

‘ticularly at a time that the

people are nominating their
next leader. Remember, we
shall forgive but never forget
what happened in Namibia
prior to independence and
especially those who have
sacrificed their lives for this
nation. Today we are a free
people with only one aim; to
restore our dignity and claim
back what was stolen and
what belongs to us.

I would like to conclude
by quoting his Excellency in
his last State of the Nation's
address, “A united people
striving to achieve a com-
mon goal for all members
of the society, wit! always
remain victorious”. Let
these philosophical words
of wisdom be the building
blocks of our future endeav-
ours comrades.
