Well, in the interest of space I shall
not dwell, because after all it is obvi-
ous:

- that it is because of intemational
diplomatic and economic pressure
on the government in South Africa
that your TGNU was not recognised
by a single country as such.

- that the South African Rand has
and continues to plunge, to the extent
that (as you correctly pomt out) South
Africa had to recognise that it cannot
continue to enforce her preferences
through intermediaries of her unilat-
eral choice; and that the cost of re--
. taining control has come to, arid in
fact has long exceeded, the benefit. :
