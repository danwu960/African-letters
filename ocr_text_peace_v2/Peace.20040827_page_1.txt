‘Apartheid? At Cheetah Festival

PLEASE allow me a
space in your newspaper
to air my concern over
Otjiwarongo Cheetah
Festival which was or-
ganised in June by the
Otjiwarongo Tourism
Forum.

Initially it was a con-
cept to attract potential
investors to Otjiwarongo
and expose the opportu-
nities we can offer.

Howeverthetnd result
of the so called Cheetah
Festival was just another
form of apartheid and
racism which was or-
chestrated to only benefit
the minority (whites) on
the expense of the black
masses.

My rationale for call-
ing it this is based on
the fact that the black
participating cultural
groups received a dif-
ferent, discriminating,
inhuman and insulting
treatment. The occasion
was organised so stra-
tegically that the black
groups were performing
at a separate location
at the ‘white elephant’
museum rather than at

the main venue (open
space next to the town
Municipality) where
the white groups were
performing. The main
venue was where most
of the activities and peo-
ple were concentrated.
This was indeed a local
investment centre for the
festival.

Black groups on other
side were not even at-
tended by the organisers
and worst of all, no-one,
apart from the participat-
ing groups themselves
turned upat the socalled
museum. How did the
black community ben-
efit from the so-called
festival apart from be-
ing used to eyeblind
the local politicians and
waste their time and
energies? The level of
community involvement
from the initial stages

of the whole organisa-
tion is questionable if
the festival was indeed
aimed at benefitting
the entire Otjiwarongo.
Afterconsultations with
the organisers, one of the
black groups. was told
to perform at the main
venue, but when they
turned up at the main
venue they were again
told that there was.no.

to perform.

It must be clear that
we are raising this issue
forthe sake of protecting
national reconciliation
and for the peace and
stability to préyail<in
Namibia. To this et
I call upon the loc
politicians to look into
this matter.
