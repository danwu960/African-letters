On ‘Uninformed’ Opinions

I HOPE this time my letter will ap-
pear, unlike the other two or three
cases when you (unintentionally)
omitted them. I will copy it to the
other media, just in case.

I read the rather confusing, if
not uninformed, opinion of Nadia
Ihuhua, where she was dissatis-
fied with Uutoni Nujoma’s pres-
entation to the CHR in Geneva,
regarding the case of the Caprivi
secessionists.

Well, Nadia, like any other
Namibian, you have a right to air
your opinion as you did, so let me
do the same as follows:

How informed are you if you
label Cde. Paulus Kapia as one
of the “government officials”?
When last we checked Cde. Ka-
pia was a Party official. Nadia
rightly alluded to the need for us
to have “responsible and trans-
parent leaders who know what
is important and what constitutes

human-centred

development” She is right but
which humans are being referred
to? To me, only leaders tothe con-
trary willallow sucha vision to be
derailed by a few elements

such as Muyongo and his
cohorts.

After all when we talk of hu-
man-centered development don’t
we mean the people with a sense
of purpose, that of sustainable de-
velopment, like the ones we have?
Or, Do we mean the detractors, Ms
Ihuhua? Surely we do not mean
to spend all the scant resources
on the rights of the detractors
rather than on the pensions of our
elderly or HIV-AIDs patients?
Do you really think if we spend
millions of $ this case, we will
elevate our human rights record
internationally?

What about the right to live in
peace, the right to food, the right

live without fear etc? What kind
of agenda do you want to set for
us, innocent citizens?

Then again, since you are invit-
ing people to go to the launching
of the NSHR Report, then I guess
I (and everyone else) know where
you are coming from. Good luck
with that event, but for the rest of
us, we prefer democracy, which
is the government by the people
(majority) for the people, and of
the people.

If you really have the future of
our country at heart, please stop
being phony and be a Namibian.
The few people you are talking
about want their own country.

They will have their fair chance
under our laws. The question is,
are they with Republicof Namibia
or with their dream Republic?
