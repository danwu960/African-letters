Give Peace A Chance >

AS we all know the US and its associ-
ates are preparing for the largest and
most expensive offensive which the
world has ever witnessed. This offen-
sive is aimed against the vulnerable i.e.
the children and other innocent victims,
while the main culprits are at large as
usual. The US hunt for Bin Laden has
proven unsuccessful so far.

I don’t condone terrorism or any other
associated barbaric act against the mpo-
cent. Neither should chaos be the order of
the day in apprehending those suspects.
We are in acivilized world where the rule
of law is preserved. That’s why we have
a recognised body (UN) which is sup-

posed to ensure that peace and tranquil-
lity prevails on this planet, and among

cerned about the massive military i
up in the Gulf. It has been reported that

UN or other big nations like France,
Russia, Germany or China. Weapons
inspectors confirmed that no weapons of
mass destruction had been discovered so
far.
But the US then says Saddam is not
i g with them, and he must do
more. If Saddam lied or is still conceal-
ing something, then most certainly he
will face the full consequences thereof.
The weapons i have asked
for more time and Bush still has to wait

the US intelligence are in possession of
», evidence to prove that Saddam aD
ci’or mass destruction. TI
