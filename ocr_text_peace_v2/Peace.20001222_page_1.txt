duplication, disparities and contra-
between what the voters did
and what the Electoral College does.
During the election proceedings in
the Florida Supreme Count, I recall
One judge was reported as saying the
US election 2000 fiasco was caused
by peopie who did not follow voting
instructions. This can be an ambigu-
Ous or explicit statement, was it due
to the illiteracy of the voters or the
complication of ballot Papers as al-

determinant of the fairly elected 43rd
US president.

Having said that I salute the loser
Al Gore and supporters for conceding
defeat in the election they were sup-
