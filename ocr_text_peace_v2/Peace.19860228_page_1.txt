Preserving the
tatus quo

- ‘THERECAN BE no pretense. There
can be no cover up. Moses Kat-
Jluongua isa collaborator. Heis not
only a member of the MPC,
machinery set up by the South
African Government, the most ar-
ticulate member of a Cabinet pro-
tected by the South African army and
its secret services, but he also prevents
people from peacefully registering |
their rejection of South African col-
onialism and oppression.

Al a recent press conference he |
said ‘to give people freedom is not to
give them licence toturn against the |
State’. These fateful words is ample
proof, not only of the extent and
depth of his collaboration, but the
fact that he is no nationalist but a
mere reactionary.

However devious his rhetoric, his
capability to ‘capture the imagina-
tion of the majority of the popula-
tion’ has been reduced to zero if it
ever existed at all, For to be a friend
of the state is to be a friend of tyran-
ny, brutality, violence, oppression
and similar vices.

The fact that the South African
rule in this country is illegal, her in-
struments, the Administrator
General, armed forces and national
assembly must also be without
legitimacy. |

Nonetheless, Mr Katjiuongua sees
it fit to state that ‘we must be seen to
be doing the work we said we would
do for the people of this country, and
we must justify taxpayers money’. He
even finds it necessary to attempt the
propaganda that ‘the transitional
government has committed itself1o |
changing the country to make it bet-
ter for its people’.

The laws that Moses Katjiuongua
‘holds are the laws that virtually the |
whole Namibian population has |
dismissed as oppressive and immoral
and have fought since the orjgin of
our political struggle and earlier.

Surely political stability means
preservation of the status quo. Any
change brought about by the Cabinet
will be of the type that fits with the |
grand designs and. strategies of South |
Africa to retain contro! of our land |
and its resources.

Katjiuongua deprives peace. |.
loving men and women to make their | :
grievances heard in a peaceful way.
and asks these people to surrender |
their genuine aspirations for justice, |
peace and freedom in favour of |
. docileacceptance of laws which are | |
an anathema to their interest and. qo
