Too Late To Reverse The Status Quo

DESPITE all the allegations and lessons learnt from
the past about the incumbent President, none holds
water until proven right, but it is acceptable for
people to speculatively express themselves.

Many people believe that Pohamba will keep the
status quo but experience just outside the border
(Zambia-Mwanawasa) teaches us otherwise. 1 don’t
take charismatic theorists for granted, but I believe in

collective leadership. So long as Pohamba is listen-

ing to intellectual advice and to the general public,
he will definitely deliver beyond expectation.

The party’s presidential elections are over and
there is nothing one can do to reverse the situation
and those who seemed the most preferred for the
position hold relatively less support within their
political abodes.

So, what else can a rational peace lover do? In
this state of affairs, | think it should be a wait and
see scenario from now on.
