Nam Involved With FAA
For Our People’s Safety — -

IN recent months, much has been said
about Namibia's involvement in the war
in Angola. Opposition parties, in par-
ticular, have been questioning the legal-
ity of providing logistical Support to the
Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) in its
offensive against Unita.

It is common knowledge that since
gaining independence in 1990,
Namibians living along the Angolan
border have been subjected to Unita's
banditry activities. Their cattle and per-
sonal belongings have been and con-
tinuc to be destroyed by Unita bandits.

It is because of the suffering inflicted

oo Namibian civilians near the Angolan
border that the Namibian Government
decided to provide logistical support to
the FAA, in its offensive against Unita.
What are the opposition leaders worried
about? The defeat of their long-stand-
ing ally Unita? Aren't the lives of inno-

There are of course many ways of achiev-
ing peace. Our Prime Minister on Febru-
ary 22 2000 addressed the nation in the
National Assembly and listed all efforts
by the Namibian Government and the
intemational community in achieving
peace in Angola. The role played by
Namibia was no secret. It was public
knowledge just as it currently is. Who
didn’t know that Unita leader Jonas
Savimbi was invited to Namibia in Auv-
gust 1996? All other meetings arranged
with Unita officials were also made pub-
lic.

The excuse that banditry activities are
as a result of the logistic support offered
to the FAA is rather misleading. Unita’s
banditry activities were reinforced by
the fact that Unita is on the Tun, cut off
from logistical and other supplies which
resulted in sheer desperation and
criminality.

The Government has a Tesponsibility
to protectits citizens, and maintain peace
and stability which is being threatened
aS aresult of Savimbi's unwillingness to
comply with internationally brokered
peace agreements for his country.

I, therefore, think that we all owe it to
the Angolan people to assist them in
obtaining genuine peace and stability in
their country, which otherwise we woald
not enjoy as long as Unita continues to
be led by Jonas Savimbi. All we need at

his Moment is unity, in order to
