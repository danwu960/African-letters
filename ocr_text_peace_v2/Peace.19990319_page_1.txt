then was one of oppres-
sion, denial of justice and
human rights for the
greater majority of the
black and coloured popu-
lation of our land. There
were laws instituted such
38 job reservations, Bantu
education and numerous
pass laws restricting the
movement and abode of
citizens merely on the col-
our of their skins.

One could not get cer-
tain categories of jobs, no
matter how qualified you
were. One could not pur-
chase or own property or
land no matter how much
money you had. One
could not attend any
school or academic insti-
tution. This circum-
stances were degrading,
humiliating and restrict-
ing the human spirit of
our people for generation

fairly. It was a vision
where no one tribe would
again try to dommate over
the others. It was also a
vision where all

pressed population.
