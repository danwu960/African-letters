Rebuke For ‘Moderates’

WE would all do well to understand and accept
that the New War is being waged against an
enemy that cannot be reasoned with. An enemy
that has no respect for our beliefs, our culture,
our values, our religions, or our lives.

Those advocating moderation would do well
to grasp hold of some courage, and remember
the lesson that Britain learned, too late, when
Neville Chamberlain returned from his peace
talks waving his hard earned piece of worthless
paper.

We would do well to heed the advice of the ex-
Isracli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A
mun with a knowledge and experience of the
difficulties of trying to deal with terrorists and
extremists.

Time will prove to us all that we are now faced
with a for or against situation.
