Museum’s Not ‘Tacky’
Says Local Historian

HAVE you been to the Alte Feste
lately? If you have, then there is no
need to convince you that the claim of
Caro! Kotze made in The Windhoek
Advertiser of January 13 about ‘empty
rooms’ is aproduct of ill imagination.
If the colleague knew what a museum
is all about, her capectations could
have been different.

According to the International
Council of Muscums: *A museumis a
non-profit making, permanent insti-

tution in the service of society and its °

development, and open to the public,
which acquires, conserves, researches,
communicates and cahibits, for pur-
pose of study, cducation and enjoy-
ment, material evidence of people
and their environment’.

Therefore, a muscum is a cultural
institution of national significance
whose goals reach far beyond mere
the entertaining of tourists. And after
all, Ms Carol Kotze has no mandate to
speak for the tourist, or docs she feel
like a tourist in her own country?

which brought about this independ-
ence.

And if someone's head ‘drops in
shame’ in the light of the historical
facts revealed in the Alte Feste dis-
plays ‘since independence’, then obvi-
ously he/she is against the struggle.

wrote in the visitor's book the ambigu-
ous: “History has many facts’. Indeed
history has many facts and many ironic
twists too. An ancient Roman apho-
rism says: ‘When the facts speak, even
the gods keep quict’.

As to Ms Kotze's concern about
attracting tourists and investors to
Namibia, distortion and silence over
historical facts will notdo the job. This

pressions of what she Called ‘tacky’
exhibition (Our Namibian Heroes) at
Alte Feste, includes the opinion of
foreign tourists and Namibians alike.
It speaks for itself. Just to mention a
few of the remarks most often uscd
over the last four months: Exceilent/
Very Exccllent/Superb/Fabulous.
These are comments of 38 visitors of
which 24 are Namibian, 6 from RSA,
3 from USA, 2 from Norway, | from
Denmark and 2°froém Germany.

Nice/Very Nice/Beattiful came
from 16 visitors; OK from 10 visitors:
Intercsting/Very Intcresting came
from 31 visitors; Thank-you from 7
visitors; Informative/Very Informa-
tive/Educational came from 15 visi-
tors. Itis impossible to mention all the
different encouraging words in the
book, but the positive remarks are
certainly a genuine indication of the
role of the muscum in nation-build-
ing and a truc reward for any muscum
professionals.

I would advise Ms Kotze, whose
blood pressure apparently riscs at the
sight of muscum cahibitions, to seck
inimediate medical help before she
has ahcartattack, for independence is
here to stay and so is the historical

It is evident, from: the litue impxo-
vised museum survey, thatthe tqurists
are interesicd to know the truth about
Namibian history. Thus, they will be
able to appreciate the real dimenstons
of national reconciliation today and
the moral and political generosity of
the Namibian people - a colourful co-
hesion of national characters who
cmerged victorious as a nation from a
difficult past. As far as foreign inves-
tors are concerned, they are not invest-
ing in the history, but in the peaceful
and stable present of Namibia and in
the hope for a brighter future, and the
price for today’s peace and stability
was heavily paid in the past.

That is why there is a saying that a

‘Nation without -a past has no future

cither.
