White Namibians
Have Rights As Well |

- AFTER reading the article by Albert Kawana (‘Nujoma
- Best Insurance Policy’, October 23, pp 6-7), IT asked
myself why he mentioned the fact that peopte such as
he with only one passport would “burn to ashes within
Namibia” in case of war and instability, if he believed
SO strongly that his party was taking the correct course.

And he mentions that there are those with more than

one passport. I assume that he means the white Na-
mibians. Who is he to accuse them of being cowardly
and predicting they will flee their country and “‘look at
Namibia through DSTV from abroad’? (By the way,
DSTV is a South African company.)

You did mention this in your column (Political
Perspective), and I want to support what you said: even
the white Namibians who were born and grew up in
Namibia have a right to see Namibia as their home.
They also develop a feeling of belonging to Namibia,
just like everybody else claiming that Namibia is
“theirs”. Isn’t it their right to defend “their” country's
peace and stability as well? Do they have to belong to
Swapo to classify as “freedom fighters’?

Inthislightitis your and my right to speak out against
the Third Term, because we believe that it may threaten

Namibia’s peace and stability in the future. And itis our

right to convince others of our opinion by laying open

the consequences that the amendment of the Constitu-
tion might have one day. I also ask myself if supporters
of the Third Term have ever studied history, because
there we find many examples of what an amendment to
the Constitution can lead to.

To give one person more power has very seldom
resulted in what it was meant to achieve. And the
argument of Mr. Kawana, that the historic record of
President Nujoma proves his selfless loyalty to the
country, is based on a very naive belief. The president
is no saint, he is also only a human. Power is a very
dangerous thing when given to one human.

I would like toend with an appeal to you: please carry
on with your effort to bring people to their senses. Ican
only hope that people like you will always be assured
freedom of expression, and that our parliament does not

wish to change chapter 3 of the Constitution in the near
future.
