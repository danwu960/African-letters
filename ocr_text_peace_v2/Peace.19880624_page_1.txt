d.Minister of Education, Mr
* Andrew Matjila and I refer to his
: gnamef speech on the Radio
*Owambo | ‘in the Okambiya
 Ramahela programme.
-Hevwas speaking about boycotts in
»' the north as well asin Katutura, Win-
7 @hoek. What upsets me is when Mr
- Matjila said that the students have
nothing todo with the implementation
of the future plan, Resolution 435.
This arose from the time students
wrote placards demanding the im-
mediate implementation of the peace
plan.
~ How can he say we students are too
. ss demand the implementation
, ofthe plan?
~'E pe Ona: say to him that we
fiider te are not children and foolish.
