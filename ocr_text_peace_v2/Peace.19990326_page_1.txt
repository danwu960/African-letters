ON March 21 1990 a new
~ mation was bom. Citizens
in this new nation stood
tall with pride at the low-
ering of the flag of the
Republic of South Africa
and when this new na-
tion’s flag was hoisted.
They said to one an-
other the old saying of the

Negroes in America, “We

have overcome”. They

said to one another, “We
are victorious” and then
they made a pledge:

“Never shall we allow

Apartheid and discrimi-

nation to take place in this
country again”, and eve-
rybody then joined in
unity and said, “Let free-
dom reign, let peace
reign, let unity reign.”
This country is Namibia.

However, something
then went ternbly wrong
and the aspirations of
many and their dreams
have become only illusion
and myth instead of real-
ity.

As we go back and Jook
back at Namibia’s nine
years of independence |
cannot do otherwise than
feel a sense of being a
failure as a Namibian.
This is because at our in-
dependence we said to
one another that we have
everything under control;
‘indeed, we were told by
our leaders, “We have

bern. in, the in

community long enough
not to repeat the mistakes
made by others.”

Laudably our leaders
introduced the policy of
national reconciliation.
Yes, we adopted a consti-
tution that has become a
role model not only in
Africa but indeed in the
world at large, However,
something just went
wrong and nine years
Jater Namibia has lost its
identify as a nation.

I know that speech af-
ter speech will be given
by our leaders during our
independence celebra-
tions over the weekend
and we will be told that
everything is just fine.
This is like’ Chinva
Achebe, the. Nigerian
writer, writing in the early
days of Nigerian inde-
pendence. He said “we all

who were io exile have

“barricaded themselves

with all the wealth that
Namibia has and today
while the majority of
Namibians are faced with
poverty, many of them
have become million-
aires. Yes, there will be
those of you who, while
reading this letter will say,
can this guy not be happy
for once on Independence
Day?

Brothers and sisters,
my conscience dictates to
me that cannot be happy
and celebrate our inde-
pendence while:

* The majority of our peo-
ple are suffering under
severe poverty.

* The Government has
failed in addressing the
ever increasing rate of un-
employment.

* The Swapo Party has be-

ready as a nation to take
stock of the mistakes of
the past, so that we can
enter the future with con-
fidence. This is so be-
cause those of us who
spearheaded the tibera-
tion struggle to this logi-
cal conclusion are not
necessarily the heroes.
but I believe those who
laid the foundation are
real heroes.
Namibians and the cur-
rent Swapo government
have not yet married one
another. The truth is this
lies in the fact that what
Namibians want and what
Swapo can offer are two
different things. At the 9th
independence celebra-
tions Namibians must
start with a sou! searching

ask ourselves whether
Swapo is sal! fit to rule
