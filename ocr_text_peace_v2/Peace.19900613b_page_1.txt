Note: Brigadier Eimbeock, you have
opposed this newspaper and all it
stands for, since its inception. You
even opposed the registration of The
Namibian ina swom statemom, say-
ing that Lister and her political back-
ground proved thet the nowspapor
would become a “threat to state socu-
rity and the maintenance of public
order’. You similarly opposed the
perty which now makes up the gov-
emment of the day. You claim sow
to have changed your political view-
point. Well and good. If this is truly
the case then please sop your politi-
cal tactics. Conrad Angula mised a
very legitimate point Ln the article in
question: namely, the lack of police
presence for aa long as we can re-
member, at soccer matches. Thore is
a lot of hooliganiem, and violent
Lacidents, and last weekend was 20
® as you are well aware. On

the other hand, it is an undisputable

your
comparisons in this regard. Farther,
it is not the job of a reporter to initiate
meetings between the police and spcosr
administrators. That's your job. His

. is ¢o report on events as they occur.

The Namibian supports the idee of a
police force to maintain and uphold
public order. Ite a new concept for
most Namibians who havo in the pest
seen Che police as their enemy (in
most cases, quite rightly 20) since the
lattes have acted against political
opponents in mogt cases. So its up to
the potice to prove themselves to the
public in order to eam their trust and
confidence.

Lestiy, Brigadies, don't make such
laughable siseomonts such as ‘‘ why
you and some of your staff seek
Opportunities to discredit the gov-
emmoent of the Republic of Namibia’.
You know quite well that this is not
the issue here. - Gwen Lister.
