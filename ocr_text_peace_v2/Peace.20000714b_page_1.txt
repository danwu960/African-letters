WE are hereby tryi
sponsi

ing to correct the dangerously irre-
Dax

ble statements made one Alfred

- a Swapo backbencher inthe Neseee Ceenas
This man is clearly showing his ignorance that the
Swapo reconciliation policy is a total sham meant to
deceive the people of Namibia. Itis also very clear to us
that he has been appointed to launch a racist attack
against the Rehoboth Basters.

I shall hereby try and sketch to Mr Dax how the Baster
people have come to ultimately settle in the Rehoboth of
today. | am not sure whether Mr Dax can grasp to
historical facts that I am going to present but that is not
my problem. During the start of the 19th century both the
Nama and the Baster people who sprang from each
other’s loins, felt the bad administration of the Cape
colonial government. Together they decided to look for
salvation across the Orange River and outside the reach
of the Cape colonial government. There were many
streams ever moving northwards but the main ones were
the name groups of Witboot, Afrikaner and others.
Together with them were the Basters under Kaptein
Hermanus van Wyk heading northwards while another
group split eastwards towards Rietfontein.

It was a journey over many years of forbearances and
suffering without food or water at times until Van Wyk’s
trek finally reached the Rhenish Mission of Brother
Kleinschmidt at Rehoboth. With proper agreements
between the Baster Kaptcin and the Hereros. the domi-
that time in the region, the Basters settled

What Really Happened In Rehoboth

impossible for small clans like the Swastbools and
others to have occupied an area the size of the original
Rehoboth gebiet. In spite of this, Kaptein Van Wyk
Made agreements with Samuel Maherero, Jan Jonker
Afrikaner and others to ensure the peaceful coexistence
of the Basters with their immediate tighbours.

All that the history shows is that Van Wyk made
Streruous efforts to make peace among the warring
faction of Witbooi, Maherero and Afrikaner. He wanted
above all else to have peace in this land and security for
his people. He set up an administration in Rehoboth
based on the organised ownership of Land and property
and law and order. His administration started to delimit
and regulate the sizes of farms. The citizens santed
naming their farms and title deeds were issued.

Since the Basters were of mixed origin, all of them
spoke mainly German, Dutch and Nama. And they
freety gave names they preferred to their farms. Many
preferred to give Nama names to their farms, names that
still exist today.

Now along comes Alfred Dax claiming that farms
with Nama names belong to Damaras. Damaras never
owned any piece of land in the Rehoboth gebtet.

What we know from history is that Damaras initially
lived on the western hills of Rehodoth. This was a shanty
town built with rusted pieces of tin. The Damara inhab-
itants of that part of Rehoboth town were mainly domes-
lic servants and farm workers.

They admittedly lived in very adverse social and
economic conditions. To address this eyesore, the
Rehoboth government under Kaptein Hans Diergaardt
built a new and modern suburb on the castem part of
Rehoboth and freely gave it to the inhabitants of the
shantytown.

Today that modem suburb under the very same Alfred
Stephanus Dax is fast becoming another shantytown.
