Where Are
We Headed?

TAKING a close hook at what is lappening in our
region and in Namibia in particular as far as lead-
ership and politics are concerned» I would like to
point out two things that are ineveasingly becom-
ing a threat to our democracy.

TOLERANCE - Namibians have seen a growing
number of cases where politiciana;especially in the
ruling party, have exhibited insolerance. This hap-
pened after the launch of the new. party and there
was namecalling, especially abowsBen Ulenga.

Launching a political party issin line with the
Namibian Constitution and doeanot infringe on any
persona or other party's right of existence.

CENSORSHIP - The fact thasState-owned me-
dia are always reporting in favous-of Government
and the ruling party is.a.clear indication that there
is a great deal of censorship in theemedia. The state
is footing their bill, but as a taxpayer I want to be
fed with real, correct-and factaalvinformation and

news. .

Hearing lines like ‘the jegitimate-government of
President Kabila’ on NBC makes: me laugh. What
makes Kabila’s government- legitimate one? Is it
because it was brought to powentiirough the barre!
of a gun? fs it because Kabila overthrew:a long time
dictator with the helpof forsiggntroops? Is it be-
