Support For Renaming

PLEASE allow me to express my support for the
Swakopmund Town Council decision torename some
Streets in the coastal city. I believe that it is time for
us Namibians to have our identity spelled out in the
names that best describe our cultures, including our
Namibian heroes wherever they are.

Why should we have German names used in our
country while many of our people who liberated this
country are not acknowledged. How will we learn
about the likes of Brendan Simbwaye, Peter
Mweshihange and many others who sacrificed their
lives for the independence of this country.

I call upon all those who are against this idea to bear
in mind that that the peace we are enjoying today
came as a struggle which needs to be promoted in
every aspect. This also includes the renaming of the
Caprivi region to something with a Namibian iden-
tity.
