ike to see their
Continent out of its negative po-
litical, social and economic Posi-
tion. :

Tam talking of these African
Patriots who have seen their con-
tnent mercilessly reduced to ru-
ins by the western imperialists
and have acted by working out
SOME Strategies onhow to liberate
Africa fully in the economic, so-
cial and politica] sphere.

Their plan of action kicked off.
Unfortunately, some fellow A fri-
Cans started hampering the good
Progress and things started to go
awry. Here I am talking of those
African leaders who in their re-
ive countries hacked the feet

hands of their People with
machetes, enriched themselves,
are racists and plunged their coun-
nes into vicious cycles of civil
wars and economic disasters.
Hence due to these prevalent situ-
ations, Africa's Capacity-building
Was crippled and less was
achieved as a result.
To redress that fate. the African
Patriots thought of another strat-

that are absent in the existin ing en-
tities and they should be capable
to curb the scary situations I have
Mentioned. These elements in-
clude: conflict Prevention, peace,

uman resource development and
Others

Their absences in the existing
entitles is believed to be the rea-
son for their failure. These ele-
ments are going to be ensured
under the framework of the peer
review mechanism
Structure that makes it more vi-
able. Thus, if you weigh these
Principles you can really see that

Can save African from its
multiple upheavals.

Its viability can also be fore-
Seen in essence because itcame at
the right time when the world is
experiencing a wave of
globalisation and realising a need
for genuine cooperation between
the developed and developing na-

tons. Envisioned to operate along-
side with the African Union, it
could imply that Africa can

Sign up foe it (Nepad) and com-
Mit to it, We should stop nonsen-
sical wars and declare war on
Poverty instead. The idea needs
the input of the developed na-
tions, ing a need for us to
Cultivate a culture of diplomacy
and stop Pointing fingers and or
making Nasty statements against
other countries and their leaders
for our failures.

In a nutshell, Nepad will nog
excel if we continue being cor-
rupt, non-transparent,
undiplomatic, selfish, arrogant
and uncooperative. We should
Start allocating more money to
Our education, health sector and
infrastructure rather than play-
ing deadly military games as in
the DRC, Ivory Coast just to
mention a few.

In conclusion, let me say we
should collectively altow Nepad
to be fruitful and also asa lasting
solutionto Africa’sdevelopment
problems.
