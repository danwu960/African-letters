WE HAVE read, with interest, a letter
received from Minister Koscnguizi
typed on a letterhead of the Depart-
ment of Information, indicated that
even euch letters are done at the tax-

payer’s expense.

Minister Kosonguizi’s epistie is

provision of these facts and the

millions, if not billions of Rand from

the pockets of the South African and

Namibia taxpayers, and in the case of

taxpayers and without the consent of

We canal! agree that a constitution
is one of the most important pillars of
a stable democratic state - if not the
very foundation of it. But surely such
an important besic document must
represent the will of the people of
Namibia otherwise it will have to be
imposed and then it will not be worth
the paper on which it is written. To
represent the will of the people, it
follows that only truly elected
representatives of the people can
represent the will of the people.

And to elect such representatives of
the people who will then draw up acon-
stitution for Namibia, in the exercise
of their self-determination and right
to independence, is the very aim and
essence of Resolution 435 of 1978.

refugees and confront Swape face to

the judges. When the Honourable
Minister denigrates Swapo, he should
remember that he himself set out the
options for Namibian resistance after
the 1966 World Court decision on
