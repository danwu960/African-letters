Why Assassinations Don’t Work

ALLOW me some space, please,
to remind some of your readers
that before they write about any
conflict around the globe and the
peopie involved init, todo some
research first on particular mat-
ters and to have a more realistic

A letter to The Namibian
- ‘Condemn the Killers’ - is an
example where the writer shows
his total ignorance about the
situation in the Middle East and
it’s people.

The writer claims that Pales-
tinians are foreigners in the Holy
Land and should be expeiled by
the Israelis in order to achieve
everlasting peace. He also writes
that Palestinians are not men-
. tioned in The Bible or recorded
by historians. In the letter he
criticised European Union gov-
emments for condemning the
assassination of Hamas leader
Yassin by Israelis.

This isn’t the place for me
to write about the 10 000-year
long history of these two great
nations which contributed so
much to world cultures in terms
of many discoveries, writings

and science. My sole objective
is to correct misperceptions on
this particular issue.

The fact is that the Arabs
and the Jews believe that they
descend from the same father
- Abraham. No-one is sure who
came first tothe Holy Land. His-
tory only tells us that Palestine
was first peopled by wandering
Stone Age hunters and that per-
manent agricultural settlement
appeared at Jericho about 8000
B.C. According to historical
claims Hebrew (Jews) tribes
arrived from the desert in Pales-
line between the 14th and 12th
century B.C.and that roughly
the same time the Philistines
invaded from the sea.

The name Palestine is in fact
anadaptation from a Greek word
“the land of Philistines” and the
name is mentioned many timesin
The Bible. First Book Gen 21:34:
“Abraham lived in Philestia for
a long time”.

Just for the record 1 would
like to mention that in 1918 the
Palestine population consisted
of 500 000 Muslim Arabs, 100
000 Arab Christians and 60 000

Jews.

At the time of the 1948 war,
more than 500 000 Palestinians
fled from their country to seek
refuge with Arab neighbours. In
every Arab country where they
landed, they were treated as
second-class citizens, confined
to ghettos specially created for
them

Why EU governments con-
demn the killing of Hamas
leader Mr Yassinis because they
believe that the assassination of
political leaders promotes more
violence and does not provide
a solution for either sides. Not
long ago, Swapo was just like
Hamas, on American terrorist
lists, and everybody wouldagree
with me that assassination of its
President, Sam Nujoma, by the
former South African white re-
gime, would only have destroyed
the relationship between blacks
and whites and caused more ha-
tred; but would ultimately never
have prevented Namibia from
becoming Independent.
