To Eat Promptly, And In Peace. :

EVERY once in & while, ons would like to share experi-
ences and happening: with other people, in order to either
ing the sare, or to hopefully shed

would like to share one such
hope that this will have some kind of (positive) impact

We all like to slip away from office during our hunch
hours (usually between 1 and 2) and grab something small
to eat, preferably in pleasam company, i
surroundings if

name the little comer amongst birds and trees, created in a
backyard-garden like , where I decided to take
a female friend to lunch for a chat over some usually good
and fresh food. The order was comprised of a salad and
toast for the lady. After having been helped promptly, the
waiting began. As the minutes ticked by one after the other,
I decided to enquire about the delay. One of the waiters told
me that the order was almost ready and that I should be
patient. | was amazed that a lukewarm pasta salad could
take over 25 minutes to make ... after all — to cook pasta
takes at most 10 minutes!

Eventually food was served at 13h40. After eating as fast
as possible without being obscene in doing so, I decided to
ask for the bill to pay for food consumed. Amazingly, fot
the next 10 minutes no waiters were to be seen anywhere in
the eating area! I then walked upto the counter outside, and
asked for the bill, clearly stating that I was by this time in
a great hurry. It was 13h58 already, and my friend and I

were going to be late for both our jobs. After waiting at 4
another 5 minutes, now slightly annoyed, I decided to

without and to return later for such. As ott
vio te waiter came running after us, expecting mert
pay for lunch once I was inside my car! I refused to do

pe ef. only to be called about an hour later and told a
I would have to deal with the Police in this matter should
Trefuse to pay for the food and services rendered. Task ;
though - what service? I work in a highly customer servigg’

related industry, and thus am well familiar with the con:

cepts of customer satisfaction and prompt, efficient and!

friendly service. I would like to conclude in asking this: are:

we forced to merely endure slow and inefficient service in’

instances such as these? Should we, as the clients

customers, the consumers, andeffectively the money

ers to establishments such as this one, stand up and deman{

better and more customer-oriented service? Upon

ing to pay the outstanding bill, I had to listen to

of being ill mannered, and guilty of theft, with no intentiog)

of resolving the matter from my side...
Occurrences like these seriously hamper the enj

of the public, and thus I am inviting the editor and the

readers to comment on such instances, and let us try tp.

resolve these problems. After all - what we as consumer

want is some quiet place to sit and enjoy our lunch, no

having to worry if the food is served on time.
