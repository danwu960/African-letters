Guise Of Anti-Terrorism

AMERICA has always
presented herself not only
as a superpower, what-
ever that means now, but
also a moral power of
some sort. However, any
critical observer of the
American governments
and administrations,
whether past or current,
knows that their moral
and ethical banks have
been chronically bank-
rupt!

These are the very
same people who are de-
ceptively against terror-
ism and the use of weap-
ons of mass destruction?
Really, for how long will
these people continue to
delude themselves into
believing that they can
fool all the people all the

time?

What are they doing to
Afghanistan and the in-
nocent Afghans is surely
a crime against human-
ity!. But, who will pun-
ish this kind of modem
and technologically ad-
vanced type of terrorism,
when the whole world is
told to either be against
Bin Laden’s alleged ter-
rorism or for American
terrorism!

This type of moral
sickness is at the very
heart of global instabil-
ity and a serious threat to
world peace. Incidentally
Islam means (universal)
peace.

If Muslims in the world
get deceived by all the
sweet talk of Bush, Blair

and company that they
are not involved in acru-
sade against Islam and
Muslims, then they may
wake up too late to real-
ise that the Afghans will
have been nuked to death,
right in broad daylight.
America has publicly
confirmed that they have
used the so-called tacti-
cal nuclear weapons.

In fact, what is meant
by carpet bombing? What
do you bomb for over a
month in a country like
Afghanistan? What else
is left to bomb except ci-
vilian targets which they
fancifully call collateral
damage. In the meantime
terrorists like Ariel
Sharon continue to com-
mitacts of genocide, with

the generous assistance
of America in Palestine.
Isn’t this clearcut moral
bankruptcy and down-
righthypocrisy? America
must just learn to recog-
nise that that it has never
been innocent of global
terrorism itself. Terrorism
is just evil, even when
committed under the
guise of anti-terrorism and
under the American flag.

God Almighty tells us
in the Holy Quran, ‘Fear
them not, but fear Me”
and Stand out firmly for
justice and truth, no mat-
ter. Down with global ter-
rorism!
