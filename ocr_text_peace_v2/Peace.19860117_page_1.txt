and disunity because of people who
want to participate in the peace talks.

It is not good for a strong
Organisation like Swapotoimprison
people who want to talk. Swapo are
losing a lot of support by that kind
of action. Let the people come and
talk, who don’t Want to be a part of
Swapo anynioré. Swapo will not lose

but will only come out benérandit
will show a just organisation.

I feel that it is time to stand
together and show the world that
Namiblans want feal freedom. We
must cast out the people who don’t
want the same as us.

I feel it is time for our leaders to
come to Namibia so the people can
see them again, because only a few
know them anymore, This will make
the people strong again..

Let us not listen to the stories |
anymore. Let us make our prothises —
good,
