Why Do Certain Nations Behave The Way They Do?

VIOLENCE and terrorism
are no way for creating
peaceful and stable socie-
ties, which embrace norms
and standards thal are gen-
erally seen to be univer-
sally acceptable. Differ-
ences in ethnicity, culture

and religion will occasion-
ally present significant
problems, but we are re-
quired to deal with these
and to find solutions that
are meaningful and sustain-
able - not go to war.

We have recently come

to recognise the gulf of
understanding between the
Muslim and non-Muslim
world. From an ethical and

perception. Why is it that
the Taliban and Muslims in
Saudi Arabia, for instance,
interpret the Q’ran so dif-
ferently? Is it merely fun-
damentalism building upits
own head of steam on the
one haad, and Arab hedon-
ism built upon oil wealth
on the other, or is there
more out there that we
should be aware of?
Why are some nations

ple and their Administra-
tion, it is the psyche of the
nation that gives cause for
concern. In discussion

box does litte to change
the status quo. Many
American friends and col-
leagues understand and
share the concerns of those
living outside the borders
of the USA, but are power-
less to do anything con-
structive. Big Brother is
invasive and insidious!!!
There is abnutal streak in
the psyche of the Ameri-
can people. The USA might
be the moet powerful world
power on the planet to-day,
but it is not the most civi-
lised! It still practices capi-
tal punishment and ex-

ecutes human beings in the
most horrendous and bi-
Zarre ways devised by so-
called modem man. From
passing thousands of volts
of electricity through the
buman body to lethal injec-
tions, and all in the name of
justice, must rank as the
ctuellest indictment of civi-
lised norms and standards!
The American peopte have
come to believe that this is
how one exacts justice!
They tum it into aspectacte
by watching it on closed
circuit television in true
Hollywoodian fashion!
Can anything else be more
bizarre, or more bnitalis-
ing? Yes, watching Afghan
women and children scat-
ter for their lives while
American bombs rain
down, is more bizarre and
brutal!!
Nottotalk of weapons of
mass destruction! America
is the only country on the
planet to have dropped an
atomic bomb on another
country. The immediate
destruction was bad
enough, but what about the
nuctear fallout, not just for
Japan but for the region?
Did America care? They
fegarded that as a major
achievement in the annals
of technology and modern
wasfare! So much for car-
ing about the planet! And
the refusal of the Bush Ad-
ministration to sign the
Kyoto Accord, what does

that say about commitment
to the well-being of the
Planet and the rest of us
mortals who are not Ameri-
cans? And the use of agent
orange in Vietnam, was
that humane?

Mt is my belief that the
power and might of the
American people is par-
Ually based on their dam-
aged psyche. Institutional-
ised violence and brutality
desensitises them to the
feelings, aspirations and
sensitivities of the rest of
the world. A judicial sys-
tem based on brutality can-
Not creale justice, just as
war and destruction can
never bring about peace.

After the liberation strug-
gle, both South Africa and
Namibia removed the death
sentence from their legal
systems. None of our op-
pressors and persecutors
was condemned to death,
and no Nuremberg -type tri-
als were held to revenge
the deeds of the past, dur-
ing which thousands also
fost their lives over many
decades. Instead, we opted
for reconciliation, and we
are all the better for that.
This seif-same aparthe+d re~
gime in South Africa was
supported by the USA as
was Unita in Angola. Bill
Clinton's administration
went as far as requesting
the De Klerk government
to ensure thal no nuclear
technology felt into the

hands of the Mandela-led
ANC government, because -
they could not trust the new
black leaders! They were
happy to throw their tot in
with the white pariah racist
regime, but they would not
trust the new black govern-
ment.

No, we do not need any
form of moralising from
those who backed our ersi-
while persecutors. We par-
ticularly have no interest in
being on “their side!” Back-
ing ourselves certainly does
not imply backing terror-
ism and that is what the
Bush administration is so.
clumsily trying toinfer in its
Statemem that “we are ¢i-
ther with them or against
them!”

Americans need to di-
vest themselves of the no-
tion of revenge as a means
of creating a peaceful
world. They can do so by
distancing themselves from
their own forms of institu-
tionalised violence, which
they mistakenly believe tq
be justice. And they can
begin to show some regard
for the millions of us who
are not Americans, and who
do not share all of their
values, ethics and morals
notwithstanding.

The rest of the wortd does
NOT have to catch a cold
when Amenca sneezes!
