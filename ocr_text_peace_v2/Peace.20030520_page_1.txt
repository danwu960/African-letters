Stop Rape And Violence

MANY more young people are becom-
ing violent in their relationships. Some
of them brutally kill their partners. Is
that love? Love is not violent and vio-
lence is wrong. In Namibia there are
many cases of partners killing one an-
Other, because one partner tried to ter-
minated the relationship.

I would like to express my condo-
lences to the three young women Mirjam
Ndakumininwa Haindongo, Susan
Nangula Ikela and Ipula Akwenye who

They need to be given love, care and
Protecoon against all form of viotence
and abuse. Violence against women and
chikiren is widespread in Namibia. Some
young men forced their partners into
sexual slavery. Is that love? But love 5
not pain or violence. The death of even
one Woman in Namibia tm ths manner 1s
unacceptable.
Let us respect their quality and dig-
nity. Let us show our ip and

solidarity as young people of Namibia to
oppose this villainous behavior.

Lwould also appeal to the law enforce-
ment authorities to take drasnc actoa

were brutally murdered by their part-
ners.

Women should be allowed freedom

of movement and speech and to do what
they want, think is the best and what
they need. : Today we are ea ovine Dy
