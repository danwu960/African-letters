Govt Managers Fail To Respond To Queries

An open letter to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Basic Education

{ AM totally disap-
pointed in the way some
senior officials within the
education ministry deal
with letters addressed to
their offices. Ethink of-
ticialy deliberately ig-
nore letters written to
them The aim of such
letters 1s merely to seek
answer to questions. In
literate societies every-
body knows that ethics
are to be honoured. |
think the same needs to
apply when it comes to
those employed by gov-
ernment. [tis very sad to
learn that some of our
senior government offi-
cials display apathy in

this regard. [tis high time
that such officials be
brought to book or even
be replaced hecause they
are NOt interested in ex-
eculing their tasks etfi-
ciently and are thereby
tarmshing the good tm-
age and reputation of the
Government.

L have been confiden-
tially briefed that dispari-
ties still remain un-
touched and conse-
quently some principals
and heads of departments
at schools under the Min-
istry of Basic Education
still suffer financially
due tothe apathy of those
in power to redress con-

ditions of service. Wit
the implementation
Wascom some dra
changes were brow,
remuneration of teoh-
ing staff. As of | Aprsl
1996 all principals and
heads of department with
qualifications below the
level ot Category “C”
were translated into sal-
ary notches fower than
those of their counter-
Parts in similar positions
of responsibility. On es-
timate the difference
could be in the vicinity
of N$40 000 per year.

I think something is
amiss. Whether a princi-
pal has category-C quali-

ns or not, he/she

agains the accounting
-erutthat school. He/

.. nas exactly the same
amountof responsibility
over everything taking
place at his/her school.
Was itreally fairtothem
to be lower than their
counterparts? This state
of affairs just doesn’t
make sense to me. The
affected principals and
departmental heads
brought theircase to their
bargaining agent namely
Nantu. Not much was
achieved and nothing
was changed. These
managers further del-
cgated a spokesperson to

NAMIBIAN COLLEGE OF OPEN LEARNING

established by an Act of Parliament, which provides courses for adults
and out-of-school youth.

solicit their fate with the
Ministry of Basic Edu-
cation, Sport and Cul-
ture since 1996 but again
nothing could be
achieved. Ag of late, re-
newed efforts were
launched with the Per-
manent Secretary's of-
fice but it seems to me
that this office is either
nonfunctional or those
within it turn a blind eye
to this sensitive case.
What is so difficult about
it? Why is the office of
the Permanent Secre-
tary not solving this im-
tating concern?

Please comrades, let
us come out in the open

boldly and explain to the
nation the reasons for not
being forthcoming. I per-
sonally challenge the PS
of the Ministry of Basic
Education or anybody
acting on her behalf it
she might be out of the
country at present, totell
the nation why this issue
is sll unresolved after a
period of 5 years.
Could the PS also tell
the nation why her of-
fice fails to respond to
letters forwarded to her
office? Do we really have
to tum to industrial ac-
tions and demonstrations
in order to solve prob-
tems? This is not a good
thing for the image of
the Education Ministry
and the country in gen-
eral. How cana Ministry
take more than 6 weeks
to respond to corre-
spondence? The manag-
ers sent a letter to the PS

‘on 5 September 2001.

After a waiting period of
4 weeks a telephone in-
quiry was made about
the letter. Officers within
this office promised to
look into the case and

come back. Up to now
no ane came back to tell
whether the letter is be-
ing attended to. Various
follow-up calls were
made to the office of the
PS response on the letter
but unfortunately no-
body could shed light on
this letter. They ac-
knowledged the receipt
thereof. God alone
knows why they don’t
respond. What kind of
treatment ts that? Let us
please hear the response
from the PS that the con-
cerned group could find
their peace of mind or
seek further audience
and assistance with those
agencies/institutions that
would be in a better po-
sition to help them get-
ting their rightful share
of the Wascom cake. |
am very glad I was
briefed about this way of
doing things in Govern-
ment. As a labour advi-
sor. | will not rest until
justice has been done to
these managers.
