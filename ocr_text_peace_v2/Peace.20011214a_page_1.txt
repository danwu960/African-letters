DEEPLY shattered by the
immense increase in the
worldâ€™s social evils, espe-
cially in this generation, I
am deprived of any choice
but to express my dismay
and that of great people who
still believe in peace.

This century has expen-
enced the most horrific and
disastrous violence imposed
on the most vulnerable peo-
ple. women and children.
Our men have become heart-
less and tyrannies symbol-
ising a world leading to
chaos, selfishness and ag-
gression towards neigh-

bours. Evidence of ill-treat-
ment is not difficult to find;
for instance the suppression
of women in Afghanistan.
Women are forced under the
veil and are given noor little
freedom.

Most of the world seems
not to be showing any genu-
ine sympathy or taking joint,
firm action against viola-
tors of human rights. It is
mystifying to understand
how or why any human be-
ing can torture or show ag-

gression to especially the
most feeble and defenceless
of all.

Even babies as litle as
only nine months are vic-
tims of these evil deeds.

Babies are greeted with
hatred and torture instead of
love and security. Citizens
are brutally murdered and
our elders deprived of the
respect and protection they
deserve.

It is confusing how our
leaders enthusiastically

preach about peace and hu-
man rights and at the same
time enjoy power and wealth
while the citizens are suffer-
ing. Some leaders are even
unfalteringly proud of per-
secuting innocem people for
pretty crimes .

I believe that it is our duty
to safeguard human dignity,
protect human rights and
most of all, the importance
of life. It should be our
number one prionty because
evil has no borders.
