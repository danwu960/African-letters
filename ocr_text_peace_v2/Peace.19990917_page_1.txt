ALLOW me to say something about the situation
in Caprivi. The people from Caprivi, I take it,
understand the situation better than other Na-
mibians. Onlookers see the situation in many dif-
ferent ways including Chief Riruako, the NHSR
and the Opposition's views.

’ But all these are partially right or wrong and the
ruth of the matter is that if you harbour bad
feelings about others you end up getting hated
yourself!

The tribal animosity that the Linyanti tribal
authority has been nurturing.

The amalgamation of tribes into a single Mafwe
tribe, the conflict that raged on between the
Masubia and the Mafwe which later spilled over to
the Mayeyi and saw a spat of roadblocks, beatings,
shootings and the killings of two teachers, one at
Sachona and one at Linyanti, the resistance against
the government, threats of death and finally the
flight to Botswana are all signs of the times and a
bad outcome. ,

matter is power, both tribal and political, with
empty promises made by Muyongo to his cohorts.

He thought fighting for it would be the easiest
way, but he underestimated the government, and
{the poor followers out of despair just followed

blindly. Who is then to blame? Of course not the

himself. Ihave strong beliefs that human rights are
universal.

Both the dying and living have rights that need
to be recognised equally. We know lawyers are
making money out of the situation, but this should
not undermine the rights of others. [tis interesting
to hear from acertain lawyer that he condemns the
activities of the rebels but at the same time he is the
one pocketing moncy from the same people for
their defence - what a double standard. Would it
therefore not be interesting to find out how those °
photos got to the media if there was money
involved and if this is so to what degree is this
professional? Namibians should put the blame
whete it is due.

This was a very unfortunate self-sought situa-
tion, the security forces therefore performed their
national duties as expected of them. One wonders
what national role rebels were fulfilling apan
from committing abominations.

If you put your hand in a hole where a snake is
you should face the consequences of the outcome.
Let the government carry out its constitutional
tesponsibility which is the protection of the sov-
creignty and democracy of this country.

Peace is a precious commodity and cannot be
allowed to be messed up by those who think they
can take out their frustrations on innocent citizens.
call on all peace loving Namibians to stand with

government to defend the peace this country has
dearly earned.
