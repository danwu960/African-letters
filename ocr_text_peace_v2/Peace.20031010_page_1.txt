‘Big Goats Don’t Sneeze Without Reason’

ALLOW me space in the peopk’s
paper to air my views on same issues
that are not right in our country. I am
disheartened by the receatevents where
our commander in chief criticised one
section of our community, namely the
whites. Whatis happening? What went
wrong?

There is asaying, which goes: ‘a big
goa does not sneeze without a rea-
son”. If there is something going on
about the whites in this country then
we as citizens also deserve the right to
know. To blame people just out of the
blue is not a good thing, especially
when it is done by a person who is
supposed to unite the whole nation.

What has happened to our policy of
national reconciliation? Is it working or
dead? Of course it is the government
that brought itinto being and if itis dead
then we as a nation also deserve to
know so that we can also start criticis-
ing some fellow blacks who did us
wrong during the liberation struggle. J
lost my brother because my neighbour
reported him to the South African army
to be a ‘terrorist’. I have forgiven him
but I did not forget. J am also fully
aware of the atrocities that the Germans
and the South African colonisers have
committed againstour people but which
whites did this kind of thing? Is itGwen
Lister? Is it Hannes Smith? Believe
me these whites, Gwen and Hannes,
also suffered but of course not the
same way the blacks did. Just like
today some blacks are driving beauti-
ful 4x4s because it suits their status
while some fellow blacks are going

hungry with no shelter, nothing.

I cannot understand that 13 years
after independence whites are still
causing divisions amongst the people.
Are we so stupid that we (blacks)
cannot think for ourselves? How can
we allow ourselves to be divided by
others? Maybe there is something
wrong with our systems, which in fact
might be causing divisions and not the
whites. How many white farmers are
ministers today? How many whites
are CEOs? Of course many are com-
mercial farmers and is it this which is
causing problems? We have the right
to know.

Saying whites are causing division
while we have the full commanding
power to me is a joke. Fine, we have
the capacity todeal with them. Why do
we say this instead of just acting but of
course acting with reason? We must
alsoexamine oursetves before we stast-
pointing fingers at others. I think peo-
ple that are causing division are the
ones that are stealing the public funds
So that the government will be unable
to provide for its citizens. Those are
the people who need to be dealt with.
We must try to empower all of our
citizens. Let the whole nation enjoy
the fruits of independence. If we ig-
hore that we are just inviting more and
more trouble and then we will blame it
on the whites. Do not laugh at the
snake because it walks on its belly.

We must also understand that in a
country of beggars, stealing and not
begging is considered a crime. There
isasaying, which says ‘stealing brings

misfortune”. There are too many steal-
ing in government and no concrete
steps are taken. All one hears is pres-
idential commissions.

They are becoming too many now
and their findings are just gathering
dust wherever they take place. Don’t
we have the capacity to deal with
criminals

and thieves in this country? I sug-
gest if we have the capacity to deal
with whites we must also use the same
capacity to deal with thieves especial-
ly the ones that are embezzling the
public funds.

When is the six million Namibian
dollars going to be retumed? And who
is going to return it and how? Do
whites cause these things? If yes, then
there is something wrong with us, I
mean the black people. We like “nice”
things but we hate working hard. We
are good af blaming others but we
neves tum the finger on ourselves. Of
course whites are hard workers that is
why they have what they have today.
Of course some of them have acquired
their riches by exploiting us but now
there are laws in place that are prevent-
ing this kind of things from happen-
ing. It all depends on how committed
we are to such laws.

I know that whoever reads this letter
might say that I am an enemy of the
state but unfortunately I am just being
realistic. [am nota CoD, nora DTA or
a RP. I am just myself with my own
do not have their own brain will want
to shut me off. Let’s not blame the

whites but rather blame ourselves for
our own misfortune. These days the
comrade is not always right because
some comrades are hungry and they
are doing whatever they can do to be
like other comrades. What are the 17
farms for?

Tt must be clear to each and every
Namibian, whether you are black or
white, Herero or Ovambo, Damara or
Caprivi, Nama or Tswana, San or Ka-
vango, Himba or others that Namibia
is independent forever. Hans Dreyer,
Koevoet, SWATF, SADF and Bothas
ase gone forever. If ever they will
come back we should blame it on
ourselves and not on the whites.

God created us with a brain to dis-
tinguish between what is right and
what is wrong. If you let yourself be
misled, blame it on yourself. The pot-
iticians should also stop working on
our emotions and feelings. We know
how hard it was during the liberation
struggle. We were there when our
homes were destroyed and burned
down. We were there when our ma-
hangu fields were destroyed. We were
there when our own children were
killed. We were there at Niimwandi.
We know all these things. To tell us
these days that whites are bad while
you are enjoying their company at
your farms and in your neighbour-
hood is just a joke to us.

We know how dusty itis in Katutura
but we are still there. We know all
those things and we also know that
Namibia is unfortunately a mother for
all of us. All we need to hear now is

economic development, peace and sta-
bility, employment opportunities and
projects so that we can develop our
community.

We don't want to bear hate speech-
es. We know how bad and terrible the
war was. We don’t want WAR, we
want PEACE.

We must remember that there is no
lion which cannot miss a chase, and
there is no pond that the sun cannot dry.
Life is when you are together, alone
you are an animal. In Oshiwambo there
is saying that says “Pombili iha pa
potwa!" Translate it yourself.

Let us all work together and be
united as we were during the dark days
of the liberation struggle. Whites are
not enemies today but our enemies are
hunger, disease, poverty, ignorance,
nepotism, tribalism, hatred, cormup-
Gon, sexism, self-centeredness etc. The
list is too long. Namibian develop-
ment needs us all. We cannot talk of
development if we are blaming and
attacking other people. If we keep on
blaming whites, they may say, “though
1am not edible says the vulture, yet
nurse my eggs in the branches of a
high wee because man is hard to be
wusted.” I hope we don't want this to
happen. We must also remember “he
who finds the occasion to hurt others
will be hurt by them tomorow. We
don’t want this to happen either.

Let us build and develop our Na-
mibia. Viva the Republic of Namibia
