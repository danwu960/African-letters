Colonising ourself

ALLOW metoair my opinion that we
the Namibjans, are guilty of colonising —
‘purvelves, especially in the far north
Namibia. °
Students who pass matric with good
symbols are unable to find jobe, Often.
only those from rich families are con-
sidered, while those from poor families
are turned down. Employers
sometimes only give jobs to those well-
known names from rich families. |
It, happens in the hospitals.as well.
On many occasions only those whoare
well known in the hospital circles can
be immediately hospitalised ifthey are
ill or sick, while many poor people
stand for a long time before they get
treated.
Iwieh tocall for an end tothis sort of

their duty as Nar _
. Ment duty as Namibiane and ipl

_ order to achieve peace. Stop this man-

_her of colonising your own people.
