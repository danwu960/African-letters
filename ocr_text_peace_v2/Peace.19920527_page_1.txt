What might
have been

ONCE upon a time there was
a country in Africacalled Ba-
sibia. Basibia had a small
population. Moet of its people
were poor in terms of money
but rich in spirit

For many years Basibia was
tuled by a colonia: power.
The officials in the colonial
government paid themselves
high salaries while the people
starved, robbing Basibia of
its wealth for their own bene-
fit. But the people of Basibia
were strong. For many years
they fought against colonial
mule under BAPPA, the Ba-
sibian Peoples Party. After a
long and painful struggle,

Basibia finally won its inde-~
pendence. Now the Basibian |

people were free to shape their
own nation.

‘Now we can be just like
other nations in Africa”, said
some of the people. “Ob no”,
said others, “we must lea
from our brothers and sisters.
We will follow their successes
and avoid their mistakes”.

Basibia adopted a
constitution that was admired
all over the world because it
made Basibia a true democ-

racy.

BAPPA swept to victory in
Basibia’s first election as an
independent nation because
it promised to live up to its
name as a people's party. Its
eléction posters said ‘United
We Stand, Divided We Fall’
and ‘Build a New Basibia for
all Basibians’.

The leader of BAPPA be-
came the first President of
Basibia. He loved the people
of Basibia and was much loved
by them.

“We are all Basibians to-
gether”, be said. “Every man,
woman and child in this na-
tion is my family, and I will
not rest while any of my people
are suffering”.

“That ia fine”, said some of
the members of BAPPA, ‘“‘but
now we nrust talk about our
salaries. To keep the peace,
we have promised all the gov-

their salaries will not be re-
duced. So we must pay our-
selves at least as ofuch as
they are getting, or perhaps
even more”.

“No”, said the President
“those people were robbing
our country. Why should we
follow in their footsteps? Be-
cause we work for the gov-
emment, we are given houses
to live in while many of our
people are homeless. The state
even gives us pensions and
medical aid. We will pay
ourselves modest salaries. And
J have State House fo live in
and a government caf to travel
in-I will be well taken care
6f. My salary must be the
lowest of ali”.

4 “Bat, Comrade President”,
6 others cried, “you can't
teat; You sre the father of
9. Surely your salary

the world!” Ye

The next day some of the
President’s advisors came to”
talk to him about cars for the -
government. “Of course,
Benz's”, they said. “The Ba-
sibian people would like to
see usin cars that will suit our
status as leaders”.

“No”, said the President, “I
do not think so. We will need
transport, but we must save
as much money as possible
for developing our nation. No
one working in this govern-
ment is going to drive a fancy

_ car”.

‘But Comrade President”,
they aid, “all the highest
government officials before
independence drove expen-
sive cars. And so do Heads of
State all over the world!”

“Yes”, said the President
“but we will be different. We
will set an example. A true
leader does not separate
himself from the people. You
must remember that most of
the peopk of Basibia cannot
afford a car at all. Find us
some inexpensive cars that
will get us where we need to

0”.

‘Now, Comrade President”,
said the advisors, ‘we need to
build a new place for Parlia-
ment to meet’.

_ “But why?”, said the Presi-
dent. ‘Is there no place where
we can gather to do our work?”

“Yea”, they said, “but it iz
old and dingy and we will be
crowded there. We want a
fancy room with anew carpet
and leather chairs”.

“No”, said the President, “T
will not spend any money on
government buildings until
every single person in our
nation has a home to live in.
Until thatday, we must get by
with what we have”.

The next day the President's
advisors were back again.
“Comrade President”, they
said, “we will have to make
many trips to other countries.
We must share ideas and
discuss issues and make agrec-
ments with the people of other
nations”.

‘This is true”, said the Presi
dent, “we must do some trav-
elling. But we must always
think of saving money. None
of my ministers will fly first
class, and we will always stay
in the cheapest hotels”.

“But Comrade President”,
they said, “a government min-
ister must travel in style. You
would not want your minis-
ters to be crowded and un-
comfortable”.

And the President said “how
can you talk about being
crowded and uncomfortable _
when! have seen some of our
people living in the single

10 and 20 people

the world”... :

It was.not long: before :&.
delegation.came froth Parilx- °
ment to visit the President.
“Comrade President”, they
said, “this canzot cohtinne.
We are Basibia’s leaders, We
fought for independence and
now we deserve our reward”,

Yes”, said the President,
“but we did not fight alone.
Would any of us be here in
government today if we had
not had the support of our
people? All Basibians deserve
the reward of a new Basibia
where all can prosper”.

“But, comrade President”,
they said, “no other country
in the world operates this way.
We will be the laughingstock
of Africa”.

“No”, said the President,“
think you are going to be sur-

And it was not long before
anew spirit came to Basibia -
a spirit of giving and sharing.
Government ministries held

Km be like Basibia”. ;
\: And that is how one small
gation began to change the
world.

In the. face of. the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an R&O mil

and officials of the Republic
of Namibia, I was: faced with
several questions which I coud
not help to answer.

I fully concur with the fact
that our country faces mumer-
ous problems, some short term
and others long teem. Take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane.

Now the question is whether
it is true that those ‘Muayon-

and social security payments

Tt was not long before the
standard of living of every
single person in Basibia had
risen. No one was hungry.
Children were healthier.
Everyone in Basibia had «
