BECAUSE of the high regard the BWS (Breaking the Wall of
Silence) has for family of the late Moses Garoeb. we decided
to reserve our comment on his life until after the funeral.
Garoeb was given a full state funeral with a 21-gun salute,
Preceded by a public holiday. Flags flew at half mast for 8 days.
A memorial service was held at Parliament Gardens. BWS
followed the events with great interest.
History bas a special Place for any person who has been given
& special responsibility at a given time. The yardstick being
used is how that person has related to human rights. Garoeb
was given a key position of administrative secretary of Swapo
in exile, which he occupied for 18 years. The period between
1977 and 1939 can best be described as the era of terror and fear
amongst Namibians in exile. Upon his return to Namibia, he
was given a key position of Swapo Secretary General. When
Namibian history puts Garoeb in his proper place in its annals,
it will seriously take the details of the two periods into account.

‘After all the nice words have been said and all formal
statements have had their day, the crucial! question has still to
be asked. “Where shall history rightfully place Moses Garoeb
when the whole truth is told of how Namibians have lived in
exile, particularly in Zambia and Angola, and when issues of
hooesty and human rights are taken into account?”

Moses Garoeb was brutally frank and frankly brutal. contra-
dictory, a demagogue who sought fulfilment in hurting feel-
ings and: hate speeches. In 1977 during the so called Shipanga
Crisis in Zambia, Garoeb went to: Mboroma concentration
camp and succeeded to lure hundreds of the dissident combat-
ants back to Swapo, many of whom had disappeared soon

exemplary privaic life and Garoeb had not been a good role
model in this regard.

When the UN Resolution 435 was about to the implemented,
with the demand that both South Africa and Swapo should first
release their captives, Garoeb went quickly to Lubango, gath-
ered the detainees from the different dungeons and threatened
that if they would reveal that they were detained by Swapo,
Swapo would deal with them in Namibia. At the same occasion
he “promised” them that they would carry the stigma of being
called South African spies for the rest of their lives.

Last year when some Namibians had started to organise
themselves into BWS to bring into the open the dark side of our
independence struggle. Garoeb called upon Swapo members
country wide to prepare for “civil war”.

In life Garoeb had carried a lot of secret information crucial
to BWS work. It seems he has gone to his grave with this
information locked up in his heart. For the sake of history, BWS
is eagerly interested to hear what Garocb had said about the
whole detainee saga during his last days of life. BWS had
expected that he might invite some of the Lubango dungeon
Survivors to his sick bed but this seems not to have happened.

We all know that it was a gross political blunder and sheer
shonisightedness when last year Garoeb tried to publicly belittle
the Council of Churches in Namibia. It was really moving to see
that during the funeral service his body was consecrated and
committed back to dust by the man he once so scornfully
characterised as a“‘non-entity”. However, in the contextof truth,
reconciliation and peace, Garoeb had left us with a very impor-
tant theological question: “What will you do if I tell you that 1
had killed your brother?” He asked this question last year when
he was addressing the striking workers in Okahandja. In es-
sence, Garoeb was asking, “What will happen if Namibia is
exposed to the harsh truth regarding Swapo atrocities in exile?”
answer to this question is that truth, repentance, confes-
ind- restitution are the only sure foundation for genuine
