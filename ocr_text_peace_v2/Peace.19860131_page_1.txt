Call for international conference

FIRSTLY, I wish to congratulate the
staff of The Namibian.

Secondly, I would like to express
tay point of view.

It is Bow over seven months since
the interim government was install-
ed in Windhoek. No significant
change bas come about in Namibia
except that repressive laws, such as
AGE, AG9and AG 26, are still strong
and alive.

‘Tens of thousands of our people
are walking about in search of jobs.

The socalled Ministers talk most
of the time on TV about ‘good
human relationships’ and ‘more job
Opportunities’ for the citizens of this
country.

We wonder whether these
Ministers are blind to the real situa-
ton. Katutura is a mere stone’s throw
away from the Tintenpalast and

some members of the National
Assembly even live in Katutura. They
know very well the bad conditions in
existence there.

In this country the population is
about one million, yet the Govern-
ment can ill afford to run a charity
food programme for citizens. Bob
Geldof, the London-based rock star,
can doit for more than three million
starving Ethiopians.

Gentlemen, who do you think you
are fooling when youcall yourselves
the leaders of the oppressed people
of Namibia?

Stop shouting at one another in
the air-conditioned Turnhalle. That
is not the way to find a solution for
the problems of this country.

The basic root of our problem is
apartheid. Our problems also lie in
education and joblessness. The

Ministers should stop buying air-
conditioned cars and houses.

An international conference
should be arranged under UN
auspices. South Africa, Swapo and
all the progressive pasties must try

and find a way to implement Resolu-
tion 435,

Thope too, that the International
Year of Peace, will be meaningful in
the daily lives of most Namibians.

The controversial issue which re-
mains unsolved is education. Mak-
ing a quick survey of our black high
schools you are told that hundreds of
students are turned away because of
lack of accomodation in the hossets
or because of examination faibuees.

Those in charge of education
should take this situation very
seriously.

At the same time | appeal to all
teachers to play an active role so that
Cee ae Ml the gap which is
created theapestheld policy of the
former Bantu education.

Long live The Nemibian. May
God bless the staff with courage.
