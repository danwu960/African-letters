settling feeling-that the edges of our
frail society - brave new Namibia! -
are crumbling under the onslaught of
insecurity, fear and outright paranoia.
Over the last decade, the world of
ideas has failed to deliver anything
credible to hold together civil society
« the Wea of organised religion still
hangs by its fingemeils but has failed
to address our physical needs, the great
battle tetieon and commu-
ntem has ended with communism de-
feated and yet there is an uncasy feel-
ing that capitalism should not have
won the day, because now we are left
at the mewcies.of robber capitalism. a
market-place driven beast that has no
eyes and cars for the suffering of the
litte people of the world.

t now, we haye a goverament,,,,t
in place which, after eight years of — intes

promise of social justice in the face
of overwhelming odds, is now litte
more than a self-serving, self-per-
petuating mutual admirauon club of
aging men. held together only by
their unashamed glorification of the
cheap trinkets of conspicuous con-
sumerism and their fear that, by fail-
ing to assure their president that he
it indeed the only answer to Na-
mibia’s future, may find themselves
out tn the cold at the next Cabinet
reshuffle.

And so they have all become. their
fearful leader inctuded, the unwitting
prostitutes of the “forces of interna-
tional impertalist capitalism”, to use
one of their favourite phrases. What
sickening irony!

And yet, we are expected to belive

them when we are told that the war
in the Congo Is in the defence of tn-
ternational solidarity; that we are
fighting a noble war against the dark

forces of American

If we truly support international
solidarity with oppressed people else-

yet to say anything about the ongo-
ing and brutal massacre of more than
250 000 East Timorese people since
1975, hunted from British-made
Hawk jets and spied upon by Ameri-

The ugly reality ts that our header-

in common with other dictators and
right-wing regimes than with op-
pressed people elsewhere: they will
not say anything about indanesia's il-
legal occupation of East Timor be-
cause they would like to have cheap
credit in order to buy more weapons
and other tools of death in order to
prop up their ivory-tower dreams of
being an invincible African power!
