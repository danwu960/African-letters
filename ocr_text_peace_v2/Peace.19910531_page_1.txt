The relative peace we aro
Snyoying is artificial especially
when we have certain peopit
in our midst in strategic places
where they can contimue to use
and oppress the people of this
country.

We must look at ourselves
and decide whether what we
are doing is right or not and the
various reasons for that. Are
our actions building or destroy-
ing the very foundations we
are trying to build?

It is for this reason I believe
the allegations made by Bas-
son must be taken seriously.
The Government should set up
a commission to investigate.
