‘Blood Diamonds’ ys ‘Blood Oil’

IAM writing in response to the
letter by Mr Alexactus T. Kaure
(How Namibia Supports Israel's
Palestine Occupation).

Mr Kaure has used the words
“blood diamonds” and “Methods
of Suppression”.

He can make good use of the
term “blood for oil” since most
world leaders are

so guick appease OIL RICH
Arab nations by condemning
any form of self defence by the
Israeli’s.

The same UN was very quick
to support the war in Afghanistan
after only one dreadful day of ter-
ror attacks on American soil.

The I{sraeli’s have tived with
people who send children with
suicide belts onto Jewish lands
for so many years, that people
like Mr. Kaure, like many others
may have become used to Jews
being killed.

Very few people notice the fact
that the Israeli’s have tried to
make peace with the “Palestin-
ians” even though the “Palestin-
ian” organisations all have one
thing in common: The objective
of The Destruction of the State
of Israel.

The Israelis’ have even called
these Arab migrants “Palestin-
ians”, knowing that there is no
such nation as “Palestinians”.
Any person (Christian, Muslim or
Jew !) who wishes to contradict
me on this can open his Bible
or Hadith and look for the word
Palestinian.

The closest word to this is the
Philistines, whom the Lord has
driven from His land to give to
the Jews.

I see that Mr. Kaure mentions
that Mr. Leviev is a “sponsor” of
Israel and “Jewish activities”.

So I guess that Mr. Kaure
does not like Jews or their tiny
State. It is difficult to understand
why people, some who claim to
be Christians, don’t like Jews
since the Messiah has a Jewish
mother, and his first Apostles
were Jews.

The Muslims’ Hadith give
a good idea of what the Arabs
(Umaral Khatibin particular) did
to the Jews and how some of the
Arabs aka ‘Palestinians’ came to
live in Israel.

The Jast two weeks has shown
just how far the EU and UN will
take their

double standards with the prob-
lem of terrorism.

These leaders are quick to con-
demn Israel for retaliating when
they are attacked by “Palestinian”
mititants.

The tsraeli’s then choose to
build a wall to keep the suicide
bombers out.

Then the oi! rich Arab world
is unhappy because the wall ts
very effective in it’s purpose of
protecting Jews, Christians and
other non Muslim “infidels”.

Therefore they took to the UN
and EU, convinces them that the
“Palestinian” suffering weighs
heavier than Israeli lives.

The biased UN then condemns
Israel for building the security bar-
tier. In this case the Israeli’s can-
not win no matter what they do.
From my Zionist Christian point
of view, the Israeli’s should first
seek their own security only then
the approval of Mr. Kaure, the
international courts, the UN the
EU and all others who approve
of oi] rich Arab nations who are
OK with killing of Jews.
