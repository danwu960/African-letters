At the end of his address, the Mayor
tried to restore order as the school-
children became so excited. Presi-
dent Nujoma gave them the rest of
the day off.

As I left the stadium I felt spiritu-
ally satisfied. As I saw our kids started
to play soccer on the grass, [remem-
bered that it was also the S0th birth-
day of Pele, the world's greatest soccer

* player.

Who knows, maybe one of them
will one day be Namibia’s Pele, with
the opportunities and leadership that
are offered by our great President,
Sam Nujoma. »
