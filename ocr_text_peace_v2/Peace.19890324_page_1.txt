happy?

Is it not truc that 90 percent of the
votes which the DTA will draw, will
come from our non-white fellow-
countrymen? Do you think that they
will then, after they gave your Alli-
ance the majority vote, take a back
seal, like in the pest, when the Preto-
Tia regime gave the DTA and the
Puppets the driver and the front seats
on the puppet train? No, Mr Mudge,
unless I am wrong, you won't even
be in the guard’s van! If the DTA
should win, we shall still heve anon-
whute government which, if the DTA's
lies re Swapo were tue, will still
land us in the same boat.

Am] wrong, Mr Mudge, in believ-
ing that the DTA will not lift a finger
wo get Walvis Bay as OUR harbur,
even be it only for the sake of justice
and faisnces (because Pretoria won't
like ft, as they will then not be under
our blanket from where they could

serve the masters faithfully)?

Mr Mudge, I beg of you, don’t lel:
the DTA wy and ghost us with thumb-
sucking stories and by doing 90, alec:
try to frighten the hell out of us, Las
