Thanks To Teachers And Peace

ALLOW me a space in
your newspaper to express
my sincere thanks to those
teachers who taught me
throughout my life. Now
that we are completing our

Grade 12 itâ€™s time for us
to become both produc-
tive and decision-makers
of our country. I owe my
sincere thanks to our lead-
ers who liberated our

country and made it safe
for us to study in a peace-
ful atmosphere.
