are forced to accept poverty as
their final destiny.

We who are governed cont-
rades must bear in mind that
our new Namibian nation re-
quires of everyone of us to be
a new person, with a now mind,
a new heart and a new spirit. I
also believe that the hope for
Namibia does not just lie in a
political system or with a spe-
cific government. it Hes with
us, the people, black and white,
who have come through the
crisis and have had to change.
We need new minds, new hearts
and new spirits, hown, as they
have been, from pain and

and forgivenses. Therefore we
must not expect our govem-
ment to perform miracles while
we ourselves have not begun
the process of attitudinal change.
