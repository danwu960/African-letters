What Are The Govt'’s Priorities On Land?

THE debate concerning
Namibian’s land hunger goes on
and will continue to do so as long
as politicians have the remotest
chance of gaining support from
this. The debate takes place on a
platform of highly charged
emotions leading to threats of
forced farmland occupations,
which in tin canses concern about
aZimbabwe-style sinuation arising.
The fact that we have elected union
members as well as elected
members of Parliament stating
quite openly that they wil! ignore
the Constitution and the nile of law
by taking the law into their own
hands seems not to have even
caused a stir here. Quite amazing
that acountry which tells the world
how proud it is of its Constitution
for which so many tives were lost
and which it will defend by all
means can become so selective in
its criticism or rather lack thereof.

The fact that Swapo finally
ordered the unions to discontmue
their folly is of litte consolation
when the people of Namibia are
prepared to accept such lawlessness
and irresponsible behaviour
without a murmur. The only voices
of concern we hear time and time
‘again are those of The Namibian
newspaper and the NSHR.

Here are some thoughts
concerning this issue.

A person who squats or one who
does not own land but who chooses
for whatever reason to live off that
land has no responsibility towards
that land. Once however he owns
‘land, this situation changes
drastically. All of a sudden the
availability of water for him, his
family and animals becomes his
responsibility, the availability or

pot of grazing takes on different
dimensions, no longer can he trek
with his animals to some other
place in order io be able w grazehis

to pay salaries and wages;
evenoually taxes and repay the loan
plus interest.

The situation is made even worse
when all the support systems are
pot in place and the chances of
Success are from the very beginning
remote because the area of land
givenis too smallever to be viable.
Can you imagine this person’s
discontent when he finds our after
three or five years that he was 00t
adequately prepared forthis venture
and that the land has as a result of
various factors such as overgrazing
and drought become useless,
necessitating more and or another
piece of land.

Bven though studies have shown
that the most pressing needs in
Namibia are poverty and the lack

poverty and employment was of

little concern.

the expease of more innovative
ways of trying to address this very
real problem. A foreign farmer's
land, which has been targeted for
expropriation, will in most cases
already be developed and the owner
will have at his disposal some if not
hots of money.

So, instead of going to the trouble
such as litigation, having to meet
the requirements of the Foreign
Investment Act, orrisking the value
of farmland being drastically
reduced by going to the tribunal in
the event that an agreement cannot
be reached on the price for the
farm, why not approach Mr
Foreigner and suggest to him a
partnership with a Namibian?

Instead of going to all the trouble
set out above and exposing our
countrymen to the challenges of
establishing what already exists
albeitin another’ s name, and paying
for what is already there in the
form of not only land but water,
fences, vehicles, pumps, generators
etc, the partnership can be
structured in various innovative
ways and would not cost
Government a fraction of what it
would cost to litigate, bay the farm
and develop it.

My experience has been that
foreigners most want space,
freedom, clean air and the
possibility to hunt. All of this we
could coatinve to make available
and at the same time accommodate
a serious Namibian farmer and

foreigner spends little time on the
farm. Arcally daring butinnovative
way of obtaining land is to invite
foreigners to buy farmland on the
condition that they enter into
partnerships with Namibiens on
set terms. Many a Namibian farmer
wo would only be too happy to
receive an interest free loan in order
to restock his or ber farm io
exchange for agreeing to a
partnership with a Namibian.

A priority now is to finda way of
using the best skills available to
move the unemployed and even
the unemployable into the formal
economy in order wo address the
Teal problems - unemployment and
poverty. To provide aspirant
farmers and communities with
access to land and essential services
fails to address the real problem if
they cannot afford these services
on a Sustainable basis.

Rather than continue with their
attempt to gain political support by
the unions and the Government
goal must be to give Namibians
back their dignity, which is
something they fought apd suffered
for, by giving them access to
employment and tw relieve poverty.
We should follow the example of
South Africa where vastsums have
Feoently been budgeset specifically
for job creation measures, rather
than spending huge smount on
the personal aspirations of some
politicians. What really are
Government's priorities?
