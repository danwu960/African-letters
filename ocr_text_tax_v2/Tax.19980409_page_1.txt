The DTA Takes
Issue With ‘Laz’

{ REFER to the column ‘Ekse Kuume’ by
| Nghumbilemo ya Ndakomani in The Namibian of
Friday, April 3, 1998.

As this column is probably read by many people I
cannot allow the writer to get away with his unin-
formed remarks about the issue such as cutting down
the Civil Service. Why does he feel that the opposi-
tion “are dying a slow, painful and ridiculous death?”
itis time people like this columnist stop making such

unfounded and groundless remarks about the oppo-
sition when they clearly know nothing about what is
happening in the politics of Namibia.

The writer goes on to trot cut the hairy old argu-

it how to

government, ,
to solve the lands issue, and many other important
issues, but the writer clearly finds it easier just to go
along with the stream than to think for himself and
inform himeelf of what thoes alternatives are.
This is shown by his infantile argument about why
the Civil Service should not be downsized. Where
does he think the money comes from to pay all those
civil servants? This is not a Socialist welfare state
| where no one pays taxes and the state employs
everyone until the state is bankrupt. The taxpayers of
| Namibia must provide the money to pay all the civil
servants, and there is not enough money in Namibia

to support the civil service. ;

Only if the government stops spending the taxpay-
ers’ money on unnecessary huxuries and produces a
Budget which will stimulate the economy and boost

jod creation will the people about whom the cotumn-

ist claims to be concerned stop suffering. Their
suffering certainly cannot be alleviated by giving
them jobs in the Civil Service. ;
With regard to the Budget, the columnist should
inform himself to the fact that no one has 10 date saxd
a good word about it. The criticism levelled against
it has not come only from the opposition parties, but
in Namibia, ctuds
people who have made their mark in the private
sector, not the civil service, and who understand what
it takes to make a country’s viable.
I believe that as a columnist in a widely read
newspaper like The Namibian, Mr ya Ndakomani
has a responsibility to his readers not to write 20
thoughtlessly and responsibly about issues he clearly
does not understand or has not thought about prop-
erly. If he cares to visit the office of the DTA of
Namibia, we will be happy to inform him about the
many alternatives we have suggested, but which are,
regularly wiped off the table in Parliament by Swapo's
two-thirds majority, which he no doubt helped to
elect.
