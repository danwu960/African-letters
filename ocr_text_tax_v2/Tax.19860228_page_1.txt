THERE CAN BE no pretense. There
can be no cover up. Moses Kat-
Jivongua is a collaborator. Heis not
only a member of the MPC,
machinery set up by the South
African Government, the most ar-
ticulate member of a Cabinet pro-
tected by the South African army and
lis secret services, but he also prevents
people from peacefully registering
their rejection of South African co]- |
Onialism and oppression.

Al @ recent press conference he —
said ‘to give people freedom is not to
give them licence to turn against the
State’. These fateful words is ample
proof, not only of the extent and
depth of his collaboration, but the
fact that he is no nationalist but a
mere reactionary.

However devious his rhetoric, his
capability to ‘capture the imagina-
tion of the majority of the popula-
tion’ has been reduced to zero if it
ever existed at all. For to bea friend
of the state is to bea friend of tyran-
ny, brutality, violence, oppression
and similar vices.

The fact that the South African
rule in this country is illegal, her in-
struments, the Administrator
General, armed forces and national
assembly must also be without
legitimacy. |

Nonetheless, Mr Katjiuongua sees
it fit to state that ‘we must be seen to
be doing the work we said we would
do for the people of this country, and
we must justify taxpayers money’. He |
even finds it necessary to attempt the
propaganda that ‘the transitional |
government has committed itself to |
changing the country to make it bet-
ter for its people’. -

The laws that Moses Katjiuongua
‘holds are the laws that virtually the |
whole Namibian population has |
dismissed as oppressive and immoral
and have fought since the origin of
our political struggle and earlier.

Surely political stabilty means
preservation of the status quo. Any
change brought about by the Cabinet
will be of the type that fits with the
grand designs and strategies of South: |
Africa to retain contro] of our land. |
and its resources. !

Katjiuongua deprives: peace: |
loving men and women to mate hei |
grievances heard in a peacelu a
and asks these people to surrender

their genuine aspirations for justice, |

peace and freedom in favour of |

_ docile acceptance of laws which are |

an anathema to their tterest me ft
lbcing. —
