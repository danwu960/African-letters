Oshakati/Ongwediwa Are One Town

ALLOW me space in your
- esteemed daily. There has
been disturbing talk and
often exaggerated com-
parision of two northern
towns, Ongwediva and
Oshakati. It is on record
that Ongwediva is clean
and well-managed and
one couldn’t agree more.
But comparing the two
in terms of cleanliness
is pretty much unfair.
As far as I am concerned
Ongwedivais by andlarge
aresidential districtrather
than a metropolitan town
like Oshakati. In fact there
are fewer industrial and
business activities tak-
ing place at Ongwediva
than at Oshakati. To give
an example, Ongwediva

has its own open market
where only a few do their
business. Again a size-
able number of working
people residing in Ong-
wediva either work in
Oshakati, Ondangwa or

in the surrounding towns

and villages, Ongwediva
included, conduct their
business and do their
shopping. In essence,

masses of Ongwediva

residents also do con-
tribute to the unhygienic
conditions in Oshakati if
there is any.

Justimagine how much
of a burden to the Os-
hakati town council to
provide cleaning services
tothe masses who do not
even pay rates and taxes

to Oshakati Municipal-
ity. The odds are that
some people may seek
to score cheap political
points by comparing an |.
apple to a lemon. One
wonders what Ongwediva
would become without
Oshakati.

In fact Ongwediva is
more like one of Os-
hakati’s suburbs and one
would think that these
two towns have a unified
cleaning system. Instead

of competing they must

forge mutual. co-opera-

tion, because tome Ong-
wediva and Oshakati is
just one big town.
