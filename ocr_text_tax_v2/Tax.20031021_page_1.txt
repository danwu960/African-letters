TT is with a great weight on
my conscience that I write to

and policy of the Windhoek
City Council over the Last few
months have brought into
serious disrepute the integ-
rity and the humanity of the

and I cannot held but weep
with anger and sadness at the
cruelty of this Council.

This same Council that has
the audacity to use public
funds to subsidise the water
and electricity supply to mas-
sivecompanies like Ramatex
and to grant them land for
free; this same Council is
leading the attack on the poor
in the name of full cost-re-
covery. Not even the apart-
heid Boers in power ever
imagined charging full cost
for basic water services, but
these our supposed leaders
have the audacity to force
this brutal policy onto an al-
ready impoverished people.

We have lately witnessed
the escalating tendency of
water and electricity cut-offs
arid the eviction of the poor-
est of the poor, of the elderly
and unemployed, the ill and
infected from their homes in
Katutura and Khomasdal.
The agents of this policy are
in fact waging a silent and a
secret war On the poor. It is a
war that takes the form of
perpetual unemployment, of
daily starvation, of degrada-
tion, of the infiltration of dis-
ease and poverty and gener-

Call For Poor To Seize Power :

ally undermining the immu-
nity ofour communities. The
greatest challenge for those
who still have the power to
fight back, is firstly to define
our enemy and to resist them.

Up until now, these battles
in the community have been
fought by the elderiy, on their
own, with others looking on
as if they are not affected by
water and electricity cut-offs.
But itis no longer possible to
remain silent on these issues,
for it is the very stuff of life
and history. To do nothing
and lie down at a time like
this, would be a betrayal of
our most vital interests.

The enemies of the poor
are charging inflated prices
for water and when people
are unable to pay, given the
economic condition of the
masses, then Council cuts off
our water supply. Such cru-
elty and naked barbarism
goes unveiled in Windhoek’s
upper chambers. They are
attempting to tum water into
acommodity for profit and in
40 doing, they are depriving
us of our most natural rights,
including the right to exist.
They are throwing women
and threatening the weak and
vulnerable with military
might. Anything except mas-
sive social resistance at this
point in time would be sheer
cowardice.

Water cut-offs are uncon-

stitutional and hostile to our
bumen rights. Using water as
a source of profit is but an-
other way to force the poor to
pay for the excesses of the
rich. The water and land sup-
plied for the construction of
the new State House is subsi-
dised by Council, effectively
paid for by the poorest of the
poor. Council gets its main
income from us, the poor and
impoverished people who are
made to pay twice over for the
cruel and
of the privatisers, the bureau-
crats, the lying and stealing
The war against the poor is
reaching a new peak and in
this war the poor and op-
pressed people from town and
country, who have suffered
horrors as a re-
sult of the privatisation of

in cahoots with
privatisers, began a serious
attack on the poor, by forcing
people - even pensioners - to
pay high prices for basic serv-
ices. They are attempting to
squeeze blood from a rock.
The Municipal Council, in
blindly ignoring the real con-
ditions and needs of the
masses of impoverished peo-
ple and attacking us, has made
itself into an enemy of the
poor. It deserves to be called
that, for thet is what itis, and

now it is time for the champi-
ons of the poor to rise up, to
organise.

There will be no greater
justification for the downfall
and overthrow of the Council
and its backers, no greater

stimulus to social revolution,

sence, is to deprive the poor
people of water and sanita-
tion, of land and of the jobs to
sustain ourselves. The policy
of evictions, of water and
electricity cut-offs is above
all hostile to the needs of our
innocent children, who are
always the moet vulnerable
to these attacks from the
Council. Water cut-offs are
unconstitutional and a viola-
tion of basic rights and must
be declared to be so.

Since Council has made a
policy of depriving and si-
bently killing the poor by de-
priving us of our besic rights,
8© too it justifies its own
downfall and overthrow at
the hands of the downtrod-
den mass of humanity - thatit
considers as its revenue base.
They have divided the popa-
lation into the can’t-payers
and the won’ t-peyers and they
have shown mercy for nei-
ther. We on the other hand
have found ourselves born
into a society divided into the
oppressed and their oppres-
sors. Clearly the Council has
taken its side, and will suffer

its historical fate at
the hands of those they sought
to crush.

As working class families,
we must reject water cut-offs
as threat to buman life and
dignity. We must fight for
the scrapping of the water
and electricity arrears of the
elderly and unemployed. We
must oppose evictions to the
last man, for it is a continua-
tion of old colonial practices.
We must revitalise our forces
and resist by any means nec-

for itself, is simply to collect
tames and to use its repressive
might to hold the poor in sub-
mission. We, the poor, must
prepare ourselves for a direct

_ confrontation with and a pro-

longed struggle against these
hostile forces in order to win
and secure our rights: for a
free basic water supply which
is our natural right, for the
scrapping of arrears, for an
end to evictions. These are
the demands of the multitude.
We are forced to pay for our
own land, twice over. We
must be prepared to oppose
these ongoing evictions,
against the privatisation of
the basic means of life. We

this degradation
impored 0 on us by the
privatisers and stop them in
their tracks. The mines and
the big companies should be
forced to subsidise the poor,
because they are using and
polluting our water sources,
yet, the poor are made to sub-
sidise the rich. That is the
logic of Council policy. How
dreadful!

In order to win this strug-
gle, we must fight to deter-
mine our own future, for we
cannot leave the planning of
it in the hands of such cruel
people, as occupy the Coun-
cil today. They would throw
even the old and the ill out
onto the streets if we have no
money and would leave our
children languishing in tin
shacks and slaving in facto-
ries on the outskirts of town
in order to make a profit for

“the lords of life. But their

profits are made from the
blood, tears and sweat of the
innocent poor.

We must seize our own
power. We must defend our
community and form a new
Council, not a bosses’ Coun-
cil, but a Community Coun-
cil, and we must create anew
policy that will consider the
needs of all our people. That
is the very next step towards
the conquest of our own

power.
