The Jungle Of VAT

ALLOW me to put my
view on the complicated
issue of value added tax
as it roused my interest
when I saw the letter in
your newspaper of Octo-
ber 5, 2001.

It is interesting to note
that this topic has come at
a time when many people
are concerned with the
impact the attack on USA
is going to have on many
businesses and its conse-
quences in spilling over
to the consumers. I per-
sonally feel that the Min-
istry of Finance should
again look at this tax
(VAT) as to me I believe
that it will definitely leave
people with less income
to spend because of high
taxes at different stages in
the vat process.

If one looks at the way
VAT is handled, one feels
that the Ministry should
reduce the income tax in
order for people to cope
with the VAT which came

into existence. In your let-
ter not much is given in
terms of the whole system
of VAT. To me VAT as it
stands for value added tax
is worse than any other tax
system as it tries to cater
for each movement within
the product movement.

Take milk for example
which is subjected to a 15
per cent VAT. The milk
might move from Farmer/
Producer and sold to
Wholesaler, who will sell
to Retailer and finally to
Consumer.

In each of these stages,
value is added (eg in form
of transport, warehouse,
etc) and VAT is applied at
each stage as value is
added.

Letâ€™s prove it from this
example:

Producer: cost ($10) +
profit (20%) + VAT
(15%)=$13.80

Wholesaler: cost
($13.80) +profit (20%) +
VAT (15%)=$19.04

Retailer: cost ($19.04)
+ profit (20%) + VAT
(15%)=$26.28

Consumer:
cost=$26.28

Rather than your view:

cost ($10) + profit
(20%) + VAT
(15%)=$13.80.

I used the above calcu-
lation because in Namibia

there are few (if not no)
products which godirectly
from the manufacturer to
consumer because of ei-
ther the overheads which
might be involved and
thereby opting for the in-
direct method of using the
middle person to reach the
consumers. These middle
people will then create
additional taxes as they
attempt to change prices
because of the costs they
have incurred.

Now with general sales
tax, the last person in the
process is the one to col-
lect or charge this tax and
thereby reducing the cost
of the product to consum-
ets. Why would the Gov-
ernment opt to introduce
a system which is not dif-
ferent from the previous
one anyway, if there is no
difference between VAT
and GST. The other thing
is that this VAT is dis-
criminatory as it classi-
fies some products with
30 per cent ignoring the
fair principle. Finally |
would repeat the request
to the ministry to reduce
income tax as VAT has
proved to me to be a lion

in sheepskin.
