tribute towards ruining

and Swapo credibility.
Most Namibians know
that the Prime Minister isa

football. He is the patron
of the NFA and is always

What I do pot understand
is why the Prune Minister
has to spead Government
money by going to attend
sports events outside Na-
sonal curiosity and love o!
sports. For exampk, in

1992, the Prime Minister
went to Spain to attend the
Barcelona Olympics, at the
taxpayers’ expense. in
1998, the PM spent l6days
in Burkina Faso attending
the All Africa Games,
in at the taxpayers ¢X-
pense. He was the only
prime Minister to anend
the games and stayed far
more than two wecks. Last
month, the PM went to
Australia uninvited to at-
tend the Sydney Olympics.
As a result of him having
imposed himself, he was
refused entry to the village
where the Namibian team
was staying because no of-
ficial arrangements were
made for him.
Rumour has it that from
Australia he went to New
Zealand, Thailand, Indo-
oesia, Singapore, Malay-
sia, Hoog Kong and Bry.

As an ordinary Nami-

like to know whether the
PM's travels are author.

I also wish to express
grave concem over the
manners in which the PM
employed Mr Mathew
Gowaseb as ‘Knowledge
Management Expert’ at a
whopping salary of N$409
000 per annum. Was this
jobever adverused? What
transparency?

Someumes the Prime
Minister makes encourag-
ing pronouncements about
corruption. The PM is fond
of saying: “Red lights are
starting to flicker” on cor-
ruption. But if the actions
of the PM are not red
enough than I don’t what
would be! Mr President I
think it is incumbent on
you to stop the PM before
he bleeds the Government
dry.
