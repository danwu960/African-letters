Why Do Namibians Suffer?

“I DON'T see a reason
why Namibians should
be suffering like this at
all. With only a popula-
bon of 1.8 million people
1 personally think that
Namibia should at least
be the most productive,
peaceful and prosper-
ous country in Southern
Africa if not in the whole
of Africa.

The current social and
economic problems fac-
ing the country cannot
and will not be solved
by the private sector but
by the political will aad
policies of government
inseriously ensuring that
the life of its people is up-
lifted. The private sector
(especially banks) does
not seriously understand
the real issucs facing the
majority of Namibtans
(blacks) and therefore
will not directly assist
in this regard. They do
in fact assist indirectly.
The private sector has
a legitimate reason why
they do not assist directly
and thai is bocause they
ase already paying the
government taxes (their
social contribution) for
thal responsibility and
therefore do mot see a
reason why they should
take care of somebody
etse’s responsibility. laa
way it makes sense.

Why should govern
ment receive

(taxes) and then give the |

responsibility vo some-
body else? it doesa‘t
make sense.

The issues facing the
country are mainty social
and are therefore not the
direct responsibility of
the private sector but the
direct responsibility of
the government.

Government only re-
alise (heir truc responsi-
bilides when it comes to
efections and that is when
they stast running around
selling their social recov-
ery plans to the current
and potential electorate.
The purpose of elections
inany society is to install
aleadership team (party)
that meets the needs and
aspiration of its citizens
which include employ-
ment creation, provision
of quality education,
adequate housing, socu-
rity, health, a conducive
business and social ca-
vironment, as well as
many other issucs related
to the uplifimem of our

society.

Ina democratic society
anything is possible and
no leadership is perme-
nent. .

If the government can
spend N$800 million on
vehicles (Barden Mo-
tors) and N$500 mitlion
on the aew state bouse as
weil a3 close to N$SO0
million in the bailiag
out of Air Namibia and
other ailing perastatels
then certainly the same
conmnitment should be

shown towards the 20-
cio-economic uplift-
meni and developmen
of its peopte and their
businesses.

The solution, | think,
lies in the political will
of politicians to face up
to reality and introduce
policies which are in
the best interest of the
socio-economic devel-
opment of the country.
Namibtans should also
stand up for a better
standard of liviag as no
other nations will do so
Oe its behalf. Namibia's
current infrastructure
standards are on per
with some of the most
developed nations ia
the world and should
therefore refocus most
of its resources and
energies directly into

a el,

the development of its
people. What we need
is an implementable
economic recovery plan
tha directly louches the
lives of Namibians.

1 am therefore pro-
posing the following
solution:

That the government
establishes a social and
economic development
fund in which it albocases
N$1 billion per year fora
period of five years (to-
taling N$S billion over
a period of five years)
strictly for the social and
economic upliftment of
its people.

This imitiative will
surely increase the level
of money supply in the
economy especially to-
wards the previously dis-
advantaged Nasibians

who so desperately need
the funds to uplift them-
selves and their standard
of living.

Namibians are a pa-
Gent people and itis only
a matter of lime before
their true colors start
showing An angry man
liberated this country but
abungry nation can cas-
ily forget that liberation
and turn against thai man
and his friends, leading
to a catastrophe.

The beauty about this
cowntry of ours ts that
anything is possible
provided thal the right
policies and visionary
leadership are in place.
