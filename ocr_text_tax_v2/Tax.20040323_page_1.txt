Fewer Hate
Speeches, Please!

NAMIBIAN voters havea right to be informed in order

to cast their votes with commitment and maturity as

far as their future is concerned. It is in that context that

we - again - request “leaders” to stick to the rules of
elections.

Constitution in you: That chouid at least reach as far as
knowing that it is NOT SWAPO that created the
Namibian Defence Force, Police, Civil Service etc. etc.

; that 1s an obligation every Government of a cotmtry

Sapo is just another political party and not the
Government. Sir - we do not Hive in 1960 anymore - the
year 2004 is here and we have and want to move on.

We all have an understanding that you might still
feel bitter about your past - let us, however, look ahead
end rather work for a fatere that does not bring back

Abeurd statements like “the CoD has been created
by colonialists”.
By the way, Sk, the Co Wa legate political

boomerang.

health services etc. etc. All these and many more
pressing issues and what can be done about it.

Sir - not your defamations and agitating hate speeches,
However - if your attacks on the CoD are an indicator

to go by - the CoD is doing a good job and giving you

ample reason to see an opposition in that party. .

Mr. Tjiriange, please come up with solutions for
Namibians since we all know that the tax payers — and
that includes opposition party members - pay for Swapo
rallies.

We have peace in Namibia - that is also a credit to
opposition parties since we can argue in parllament
and don’t have to take up weapons - - ket’s keep it that
way, please, and let’s tackle Namibia’s 1 multiple
problems

Create a platform for FREE and FAIR elections.
