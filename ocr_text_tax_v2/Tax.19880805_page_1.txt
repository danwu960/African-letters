against for many years has now come
_ hens. As soon as the South African

tells us of ‘agreement’

available And in a)l this, Namibians
no aay, taxes.

Tl
point that the agenda for implementa-
tien will follow the time schedule that

- was indicated by the SA Foreign

Minister, the time has come for Nami-
bians to state their position with
regard to who will foot the bill. Surely
we cannot accept that our country has
become a poor and underdeveloped and
dependent country all of a sudden.
Therefore we would like to make some
suggestions to the UN Secretary
General who will now be presented
with the bill.

Asa people whohave remained self-
reliant through the ages, we would not
like to become international beggars
at this point and would like to con-
tribute towards the costs of implemen.
tation of UNSCR 435.

A few suggestions for Namibiansto

ponder:

© Namibia still has some resources
therefore we propose that an indepen-
dent commission be established im-
mediately with complete insight into
all transactions involving monies leav-
ing this country, with immediate

effect;

Othat all export.of Namibian natural
resources be mostitored by the UN and
all resources accruing therefore, be put

- in a fund towards paying for

Namibians, the time has come for |
you to take up this challenge
