assist about 5 000 people of alvis Bay.

have been damaged and in accidents. The ae
ment vehicles which have been in 2.0 untry for
barely three years have been destroye@ ircnis lie
are destroying what is purchased with OUR
money, the violence is increasing and we sT'wi

out transport.

A week ago four men attacked an elderly person
in Walvis Bay. Three days after that a certain
businessman in Kuisebmond was assaulted in his

_ | house. The worst of all is that the Police renders bad

The youth will not allow the elderly, businesses
and other people to be attacked in the streets for
nothing. We, the youth, will take the law i inourown”
hands and we will hit back hard.

Weare directing a friendly request to the Govern-
ment, Police Commissioner and the Mayor, Mrs
Samaria, in Walvis Bay: stop the violence in Walvis
Bay; we are not afraid of fighting back, we are just
brought up well.

Every weekend someone is assaulted. We think
the Police station commander at Kuisebmond should
do something about that.

The only people who stop crime at Walvis Bay
| are“Community against Crime”. Magnificent, guys,
ery ef dre :protid of you. Mrs Samaria, bring more
‘vehicles and English- -speaking Police to the police

petations so;that we can just undersfand each other.
