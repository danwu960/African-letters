IN RESPONSE toa letter from “Con-
cerned taxpayer” (November 19), al-
though I do not deny your near acci-
dent, I must state the facts accurately
since you seem to be suffering from
loss of memory.

Firstly, I was one of the three pas-
sengers in the Community Skills De-
velopment Centre (Cosdec) car,

» which was notoverloaded. The driver
has a valid driver's licence and was
absolutely sober at the time of the
incident.

We were terrified by the speed
with which you approached the noto-
rious sharp turn. In fact when you
approached the four-way stop our
car was motionless. It therefore puz-

our police. By alleging that the police
are unable to take me to task is to
imply that they (police) lack integrity
and are corruptible. That 1s tanta-
mount to libel.

For your information, Cosdec has a
clear action programme which was
developed through consultations with
the community, minus you obviously.
You would not know that we had a
Vision Workshop in August this year,
although you do seem to know much
which is supposed to be privileged
information, which also came in a
distorted form to you.

Fifteen trainees were recently re-
cruited and infrastructure renovation
has been completed, and an ongoing
process of capacity building is taking
offering and work plans. which are
available for your scrutiny, are tangi-
ble. testimony of our mission state-
ment to involve the community in
forming Cosdee policies and imple-
mentation strategies.

It is evident that you, “Concerned
taxpayer’, have a personal axe to
grind. I will challenge you to come
out in the open and show your truc
colours. Namibia ts a tree country
where you do not need to hide behind
anonymity. ] welcome criticism atall
times, but not when it is laden with
hidden venom.
