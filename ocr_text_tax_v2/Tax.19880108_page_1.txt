Arandis unhappy

IS Arandisa proclaimed area or isita
city or a town? Since, according to Rées-
ing, Arandis belongs to the Damara
authority as far as buying houses is
concerned, but when it comes to
dismissal of employees, Arandis is a
mine town. Years back we were
assaulted, molested and arrested by
the South African Railway Police at
Arandis railway station where we had
to pay hundreds of Rands in fines.

A similar type of problem is
manifesting iteelf in Arandis again.
We are overwhelmed by traffic police
nan area where there are notraffic of-

row (for parking purposes) and only
one-way is falls under

Swakopmund (eg. registration
number) and we think that the

traffic police who seem tobe after tax-
payer’s money before the 25th ofeach —

month, seems to be aimed at colour.
