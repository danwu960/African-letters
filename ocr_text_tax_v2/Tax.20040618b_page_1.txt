UNAM Needs A Tested Leader

ALLOW me to air my
views about our one
and only University of
Namibia with regards
to leadership change. In
many universities around
the world, when a chief
executive leader leaves,
the governance of the
university see it as an
opportunity to bring in
someone else from out-
side of the university or
even the country, with
tested leadership, new
ideas and the ability to
change the university for
a better future.

In my view, Namibia
needs toemulate this style
in recruiting for the new
Vice Chancellor of the
University of Namibia

and look for someone who

is innovative, visionary,
transparent and able to
paint a better history of
our university, different
from the previous one. A
leader who will make sure
that financial maladmin-
istration and

does not happen; that itis
not a dumping ground for
useless and retired profes-
sors; to eliminate shaky
admission procedures
that allow

foreign certificates and
a lack of clear vision
and strategic planning
should be things of the
past. Today, university
leaders worldwide are
well versed in issues that
add value to national de-
velopment goals of their
countries, where issues

such as access to higher
education, knowledge
based economy, relevant
research and production
of a highly educated
workforce are not just
spoken about but are
goals that are achieved.
UNAM needs a leader
who believes and moti-
vates its human resources
to perform to the best of
theit knowledge and make
them worthy of the money
invested in the University
by Namibian taxpayers.

Henceacallforatested â€”

leader, an outsider, with
a fresh vision of what a
national university should
do for its country.
