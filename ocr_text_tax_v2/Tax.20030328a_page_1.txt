te | A Commendable Budget

S- | ALLOW me to congratulate Minister Nangolo
1, | Mbumba for producing a well-balanced and equita-
be | tye budget for the 2003-2004 financial year.
| this budget Government tried to put its moncy
of | where its mouth is.
The budget is so unassailable that even critics are
finding it very hard to dish out any criticism. Through
Â© | the raising of the tax threshold, the doing away with
~ | the pension backlog, the salary increase for public
> | servants, t0 mention but a few positives, the budget
i gives an indication that Government is seriously
3 | addressing the problems of poverty and the chronic
unequal distribution of income that characterises
this country. This is highly commendable.

By producing this good budget, Minister Mbumba
has now thrown the ball into the court of the imple-
ments (the Permanent Secrctasics of the various
ministries and the CEOs of parastatais) to sec if for
a change they will assist Govermmentpo achieve its }-
