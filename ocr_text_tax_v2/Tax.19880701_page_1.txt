concern and that something had tobe

- done. Taleo learned that many people
had complaints about what was done -
They complained about being in-
timidated to obey the call for a stay-
away from echools and work mainly by
meansof what they termed strong pro-
paganda and agitation to stir up mass
hysteria and unrest and sometimes
direct threats or force.

There were too many disadvantages:
Instead of more, much-needed educa-
tion for our pupils according to the
slogans of NANSO, there was less
education and less tests. Instead of
more pay and a livable salary for
workers there was less pay and a loss

_ of jobs. Instead of better relations bet-
ween people and between groupsthere
was.a disturbance of relations. The
economy lost millions of Rand. The
State lost taxes from which schools,
streets, houses, etc are built and
teachers paid....

South Africa will laugh that stupid
Namibians cut themselves off from the
opportunities to learn more and to
earn more. In this way we subjugate
ourselves voluntarily tothe principle
of South Africa’s divide and rule.

Are we Namibians not abletothink
of more reasonable and wiser actions
which do not disturbrelations between
us? Must we harm ourselves? Why not
actions after. classes and work? Or
short stay-aways of fifteen minutes at
certain time and day throughout the
country as a demonstration of sym-
pathy for a certain matter?

Or let the workers work and earn
money (and not strike on certain
dates), and then ask the workers to
donate a part of those earnings into a
funds for financing community
