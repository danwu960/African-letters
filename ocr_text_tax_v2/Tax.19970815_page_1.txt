Are We
Going
Crazy?

ON the unbelievable ben-
efits to government lead-
ers: Are we going crazy?
What is this all about?
While we face unemploy-
ment, poverty, former
veterans receiving amere
N$120 pension how can
it be that the President
gets a tax free winding up
allowance equal to that
of a minister? This con-
sists of three vehicles: 1 x
Benz, | x BMW, | x 4x4;
a suitable furnished of-
fice; around the clock se-
curity, four intemational
air travel journeys; a staff
consisting of | x house-
keeper, 1 x cooks, | x
laundry-man, 2 x domes-
tic servants; | x gardener,
1 x private secretary, 1 x
personal secretary, | x
Office attendant, 1 x aide
de camp, 4x security per-
sonnel, 4 x drivers. In to-
tal 20. Pure madness. The
Prime Minister receives
a tax free winding up al-
lowance of N$600 000,
... 2 X vehicles, full time
