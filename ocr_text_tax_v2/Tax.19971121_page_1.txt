On Private Lodges In Etosh2=--

1 WISH to reply to an ar-
ticle that appeared in the
Allgemeine Zeitung (11
November 1997, page 3)
entided ‘Private Luxury
Lodge in Exosha’.

We are currently build-
ing asmal! lodge - 26 beds
- on the farm KIcinbegin,
approximately 10 minutes
from the Von Lindeques:

7 We expect to be op-

rating by March/April
year. This brings the

“muatiber of lodges operat-
eigg fn front of the Von

Lindequest Gate (total bed

city of +/- 25010 270)

UP to now,

Honourable Minister, 1
and all the other private
lodge owners in Namibia
want to express our total
OPposition to those project
because:

* if your ministry con-
siders such a project why
is it NOt given out on pub-
lic tender so that every-
body has a chance?

* If your minisury al-
lows the first project of
sucha nature than for sure
more will follow, all by
invitation and without
public tenders.

+ We, the private lodge
owners have and are in-
vesting vast amounts of
money in order to accom-
modate tourists. The

money we investis money
left after we have paid our
due taxes to govemment
and is again attracting
money to both private and
public enterprises. Please
also remember how many
new jobs we are creating,
directly and indirectly.
* How big will the im-

pact be on the surround-
ings of Namutoni if even
a small lodge is to be
erected? The environment
around Namutoni is very
briule and sensitive.

¢ Would it not be better
to have an environmental
and ecological impact
study before such an un-
dertaking is effected?

It is my sincere wish -
and that of all other role
Players - that there must

I WASery gi

be a better way to find a
solution on a long term
basis in regard to accom-
Modation in and around
the Brocha Game Reserve.

Please reconsider yOur~gy
ministry's proposal andl,

better and more
able future of the tourism
industry in our country,
