Questions And Comments
On Land Expropriation

AS a landless pensioner born in this country, I am con-
cemed about the propaganda, polemic and economic
folly perpetrated in the guise of land expropriation or
worse: ‘land reform’. I am particularly struck by the
fact that many of the most prominent advocates are
those whose ancestors have never had any land taken
away from them.

Reform implies reorganisation, a new order of im-
provement of what is in existence. How dare Govern-
ment representatives use this word while the “Odendaal
farms” are disintegrating and even the farms bought by
the independent State of Namibia are going to wreck and
tuin? More on that score later. Surely a few questions
will be permitted: Who are the 246 000 landless? Where
do they come from and how will they be provided with
know-how and start-up finances? What happens to those
who loose their jobs in the course of expropriation?

In Zimbabwe hundreds of thousands were sacrificed
to the ego of a dictator and the land was ruined. Hope-
fully potential donors have observed the economic
folly of Zimbabwe.

Here, as well as over there, it has not been possible to
keep the promises made by politicians who now employ
populist methods to gain points, particularly before an
election. It is frightening that foreigners are blamed for
Zimbabwe's downfall, which has automatically harmed
the region as a whole. .

Can anyone explain why we here in Namibia expropri-
ate well-run farms, which were tax-paying production
units with large sums of money, in order to put them
on the drip of the State?

Atthe same time millions of hectares of undeveloped
communal land lie fallow, not to mention the disinte-
grating “Odendaal farms”. The President pleads for
agricultural produce and self-sufficiency. But nothing
much is happening in the areas where sufficient water is
available and where the largest unemployment problem
looms. If knowledge and “know how” are needed, why
not make use of white experts? The hated Boers are
used along the Orange River where table grapes are
profitably cultivated. For them water is pumped out
of the boundary river in spite of the water and border

question not yet having been settled.

The half-farm Westfalen (next to Uhlenhorst) was
bought nine years ago and demonstrates how taxpayers’
money and investment capital are wasted. The Govern-
ment bought this farm of approximately one thousand
hectares with seventeen thousand citrus trees for N$ 1.67
million since the previous owner annually harvested
between 40,000 and 46,000 bags of Skg oranges each.
Mismanagement by now has | 000 trees surviving.
Cuban comrades also played a role in this sad tale.
Anyone interested in observing the activities and the
disintegration is invited to do so by the brother-in-law
of the previous owner on the neighbouring farm.

Could one find out whether ministers and high-ranking
officials who have already acquired farms also belong
to the “Affirmative Action” farmers and how the farms
that have been bought by now were distributed?

Once the genus “commercial farmer’ has disappeared,
one would then also be rid of several irritating taxpayers
and producers. Then the Farm Workers Union could be
dissolved and the Minister of Lands and Resettlement
could take a rest thanks to his new productive farming
community.

How does one explain to the amazed observer from
overseas the African paradox of seeking investors on
the one hand and on the other hand deterring these same
investors by passing laws about Affirmative Action and
Black Economic Empowerment?

One complains about the need for qualified people
while they have been discharged or allowed to emigrate
- and the brain drain has not even been noticed. While
hunger threatens the population of Zimbabwe, other
African countries - even Nigeria - seek the knowledge
and skill of white farmers expelled from Zimbabwe.

Who dares to offer an explanation for such economic
folly? With such behaviour it is not surprising that in
world comparisons, a number of African States will
justify the metaphor of “sucking the hind tit’.
