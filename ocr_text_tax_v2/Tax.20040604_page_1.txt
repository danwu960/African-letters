Towards A Knowledge-Based Economy

ALLOW me space in your highly esteemed newspaper
to comment on an issue that is close to the hearts of
many fellow countrymen and women. In my opinion
the issue of economic development should not be dis-
cussed without considering the new econonny, i.e, the
knowledge economy, which is driven by knowledge
and creativity and where human resources will play a
more critical role in the creation of wealth.

It goes without saying that knowledge and informa-
tion are becoming more important than ever before
as we move toward the new economy. Consequently,
forward-looking nations are positioning themselves
strategically to face the new challenges engendered
by the new economy: they are investing heavily in
their human resources and putting structures in place
to enable them to exploit the treasures within their
people. For instance, organisations/ companies in those
countries are encouraging creativity and new thinking
among their employees and citizens. This leads to in-
novation, which results in new products, services and
consequently business. As a nation, the question-that
we should be asking ourselves is: Will we survive the
new economy or will we fall by the wayside?

In my view, when one looks at recent opinion pieces
in the papers it becomes obvious that there seems to
be two main schools of thought, or perhaps several,
about how economic growth can be stimulated. On
the one hand, we have those who seem to. advocate
foreign investment and industrial development, which
no doubt, has its multiple benefits.

For example, it creates employment, adds to the
government coffers through payment of taxes and may
bring new skills, to mention but a few. On the other
hand, we seem to have those who see education and
training as the way forward, if Namibia is to survive
the onslaught of globalisation and achieve long term
economic growth. Those in the education and training
camp tend to emphasise the creation of knowledge
and innovation.

Both camps, as far as | am concerned, are necessary
and should therefore not be seen as mutually exclusive
because a Namibia with an untrained and uneducated
workforce will not be attractive to foreign investors,

especially in the new economy where knowledge and
creativity will be to the economy what petrol is to a
car. Most importantly, Namibia will not be able to
compete regionally and globally if we do not use our
knowledge and creativity to innovate. We will become
the dumping ground of ideas, services and products
of other nations,

The way I sec it, the challenge is how tolure foreign
investment and promote industrial development while
simultaneously empowering our human resources with
relevant skills and knowledge through education, train-
ing and at the same time tapping their creativity. By the
way, the latter should also be viewed as a resource.

In my book, whether Namibia makes it or not in the
new economy, will depend on the kind of leadership
this country has. There are several qualities that will be
required from the leaders to translate the dreams and
aspirations of this nation into reality. First, there is a
need torealise that there are treasures within the people
of this country that have not been discovered yet. By
treasures I mean ideas and creativity. Ideas can take
this country far. Ideas build countries. Leaders should
make it their priority to mine such treasures through
the creation of innovation and idea creation centres and
institutions. We could even have a directorate of idea
creation and get rid of some of those archaic institu-
tions based on the old economy. Secondly, we need
the kind of leadership that will create an atmosphere
conducive to bringing out the best in ail our people
through unity, peace and motivation.

Currently, I think, we put a lot of emphasis on the
exploitation of natural resources. But natural resources
cannot benefit the masses if the latter are not educated
or do not innovate. It is only the elite and the rich
who.will benefit, thus perpetuating ‘the rich get richer
and the poor get poorer’ situation, the ramifications
of which are clear: instability and all sorts of social
evils. Education, training and creative human resources
‘exploitation’ will enable us to take our place among
other nations in the new economy.
