RCC Expansion?

IT's not April 1, so I suppose the story is genuine -
the Roads ‘Con’-tractor company is diversifying into
property development, and at the auction of municipal
stands held a few days ago, a RCC representative, bid-
ding apparently on an unlimited budget with

money, bought up a large number of these stands, and
in so.doing, inflated prices wildly for the other private
Gumans ashe ottans-ailetiersaapoenaatia

_‘cuavent state of our roads, c.g the semingly abandoned?
: Karibib widening, and the gravel roads

around the capital (every round trip to the Gamsberg
involves atleast two flattyres and achipped windscreen).
Just an idea, before we read later how many millions
the RCC has lost in dodgy property deals.
