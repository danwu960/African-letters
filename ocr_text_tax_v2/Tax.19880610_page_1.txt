Since I am a true Namibian and a
resident of the far north, Kierie du
Rand does not have the right totell me
about the state of affairs in Ovam-
boland or who is i;sponsible for things
here. We are the énes who suffer.

It is high time and resident

civilians follow the example of Mr
Joseph Nambala to defend themselves
and their families.

Every pormal-thinking Ovambo-

Kautwima, Dan and Nghixulifa, know
’ that the presence of the SADF and

Koevoet here will result in the con-

timzation of the present state of affairs.

ofthe most chaotic countries in Africa:

1968, Messrs Andre’ Laubscher and
Flip Meyer write about an additional
factor - shoplifting They say that
shoplifters shop lifters in South Africa
cause a loss of between R700 million
and R1000 million annually. This
figure represents more than a twelfth
of the total sales tax paid in one year.
Inthesame article it isreferred toone
of South Africa’s big chain stores,
which, in 1986, lost approximately
R20 million in consequence of thievery.
According to this store, children are
responsible for about 30 percent of the
thefts. The aforesaid forces
shopkeepera to make certain ad-
jostments to heir price structures in
order to survive.

Woe as shopkeepers have tocope with
agreat problem regarding shoplifting
by children. Do we have to punish these
children ourselves, should we cali in
their parents or summons the police?
Nowadays] have doubt whether it will
be of any avail to contact the police.

On Friday May 20 1988, Ihad to ap-
pear incourt totestify in a shoplifting
case. After having waited until 10h00
for the case to begin, I overheard anin-
teresting conversation. The
magistrate had bought a new Cressida
2,4GL and had to leave urgently toeet-
tle matters co: i ’
thereof. He therefore the
court until 11h00.

Eventually, when the court was in - ;

unstable future with a lot af aioe
happenings.

Secrecy on the part of managemant
is the order af the day. Some of these

- on by some of the employees.

To name but one of these sinister and
mysterious actiona, the line manage
ment are all scheduled to visit the
‘operational area’; some haw already
been, for who knows what? .

We, the fortunate to be in possession
of this information, felt it necessary:
not to let these things'go unchallang-
ed. That should be all for now. You will |
hear more from us in due course.
