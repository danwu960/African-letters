Tax Return Confusion

BETWEEN the end of April and the
beginning of May 1998, the NBC broad-
Cast a news item, stating that duc to the
fact that the Receiver of Revenue was
extremely late in posting the various
Income Tax Returns to and
individuals, the Ministes of Finance has
announced that all tax returns only have
to be sent in by Juty 31st instead of June
30, 1998. The latter dase is the one that
would have been duc of the forms would

the Receiver about this two weeks ago,
they said thal to dete 20 officiel notifi-
cation was received from the Minister
and that they still regard Juac 30 as the’
deadline for the tax subynissions, even
though they were eware of the broed-
cast.

As the NBC is the only official link
for a great numbers of our population in
respect of tax matiers it should be a
reliable source of information. 1: is
bound to happen that many taxpayers
will incur penalties and interest as they

had faith in the accyracy of the newscast.
To date, approximately 55 per cem of
all taxpayers have received their forms.
On wop of that the Receiver believes that
& normal Salary-camer receives no in-
terest on savings or docs not have other
income. The forms for ordinary tax pay-
ers do not accommodate such details.
On enquiry, T was told than these ¢x-
taxpayers would have to ap-
pty for different tax status. As this will
in all likelihood also take time | wonder
how many taxpayers cam subeait thelr
seturns on time. Partnerships or tapay-
7s with more than one business can also
bot wake use of the prescribed form as

aad shortcomings will do 20 again.

Twould appreciase it ff the above polats
could be taken up with both the Receiver
and the Minister of Pinance, as it affects
a major portion of our population. Enough
ts enough!
