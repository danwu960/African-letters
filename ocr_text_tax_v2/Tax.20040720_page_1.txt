Civil Servant Requests To Retire At 50

I WOULD like to air
my views through your
newspaper to the Prime
Minister as the head

of the civil service. .

Due to the prevalence
of HIV/AIDS and the
high rate of deaths in
Namibia, I would like
to ask our dear Prime
Minister to reduce the
retirement age of civil
servants from 55 years
to 50 years.

For example | am 53
years old and forced by
law to hang on until I’m

55, while I hay¢ already.

served 35 years and am
spiritually and physi-
cally burnt out. The
doctors said I must hang
on because they cannot
write me off. Please

dear Prime Minister go
into this matter and give
us a democratic choice,

those who are strong

and productive can go
on even until 60.

Those who have start-
ed working at a young
agecan be givenachoice
to retire earlier, at least
at 50 years. I also think
that the release of older
people earlier can give
a chance to young edu-
cated people to enter the
civil service.

Only about 10% older

peopl
are productive, the other
50% are going to work
because they arg-forced _
