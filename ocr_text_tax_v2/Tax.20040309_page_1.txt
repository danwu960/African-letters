Expropriation: What about under-utilised farms?

THIS reader appreciates
the repeated statements
of Prime Minister Theo
Ben Gurirab that land
expropriation will be
done according to the
Constitution and in
compliance with the law.

Therefore, please
allow me a question:

Is it compliant with
the law that a farmer
should be expropriated
because there has been
a labour dispute on his
farm?

Surely there are
regulations with which to
punish those found guilty
of breaching the labour
law. Up to now, I

understood that farms that
were under-utilised would
be expropriated. It would
be in the national interest
if such expropriated land
would then be managed
insuch a way as to support
more people than at
present.

What has happened to
farm employees living on
farms that were bought by
the state for resettlement
purposes? Where do they
live now? How do they
make a living?

Having lived on sucha
farm for most of their
lives, such former
employees know theland,
the vegetation and

climatic conditions and
could provide very
valuable inputs to those
wanting to manage the
place in future.

Where is a report on
the productivity of farms
that have been resettled?

I am NOT advocating
that farms should not be
resettled.

However, one of the
most pressing needs of
Namibia is the
alleviation of poverty.
The mere fact that one
has access to a certain
piece of land in no way
means that one will
derive an adequate
income from that land,

let alone make enough
money to be able to pay
taxes.

Therefore
resettlement should be
well-planned and
executed in such a way
as to really provide the
people concerned with
a reasonable livelihood.
Otherwise they willturn
to the state for help with
providing water,
transport, health
services etc. That would
not be a way to
counteract poverty and
need.
