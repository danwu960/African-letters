Shoddy legislation passed in a hurry

I HAVE a few burning
National issues to share
with my fellow
countrymen and women.
I absolutely fail to
understand how the
political leadership
understands their
responsibilities and
accountability in general.
It is a serious cause of
concern to see how
irresponsible our
representatives can be at
the expense of the landless
poor. I think the relevant
legislation is very clear
on who should take which
stringent steps and when.
The song about the
absenteeism of MPs is
getting old and requires
urgent action if democracy
is to prosper io this
country.
Something tells me that
it was an excellent idea
that MPs should declare

their assets and financial
interests - although this
would not eliminate
nepotism, cormuption and
fraud etc. However, it is
deplorable that all these
warnings as well as the
introduction of sound
and measures are
falling on deaf ears
because of the hunger for
personal gain.
His Excellency, the

President, has on
numerous occasions
wamed MPs to take their

parliamentary duties
seriously and to at least
respect the ‘Oath of
Office’ they have taken.

I wonder in whose
interest parliamentarians
rush through legislation,
just for it to be patched up
with the addition of
amendments to suit the
interest of certain
individuals. There appears

to be an attitude of ‘I have
to pass it and I need not
respectit’, or, ‘Icancither
break it or amend it any
time.’ How fast can those
MPs, who so frequently
neglect their duties, enact
laws. This haste seems to
be the new order
nowadays in Namibia?
They rather spend more
time on their personal
business and respective
interests in the
constituency from where
they hail.

When will the
Government remove the
“big thorn” (fraud at focal
authorities) in our sides
and implement stringeat
disciplinary action against
the CEOs convicted of
cormuption and fraud?

I believe that stolen
funds should be retumed
and those responsible
should be fired as remedial!
steps in the search for a
permanent solution to the

Saga.

It seems that democracy
is busy dying a natural
death since elections don't
take place as scheduled.
The leadership simply
doesn’t want to relinquish
positions any longer or
make way for others.

I agree with those who
feel that the National
Council should rather be
strengthened - not
abolished. My argumeatis
based on the time
consuming and much
talked about decentrali-
sation policy. I strongly
feel the electorate should
have reputable local
political representatives at
National Council tevel
who know their voters’
problems and collective
interests. Let the grassroots
decided their own fate.

Land tax is another
matter for concer. In my
personal opinion, poor and

innoceat targets will be
punished in the end. Some
emerging commercial
farmers are struggling to
repay their loans to
Agribank. Imagine bow
they will cope with that
financial burden coupled
with the prevailing
drought situation if it does
not rain enough.

We must remember that
the success of good
governance is not
measured by the number
of useless legislation, but
rather by the successful
implementation of these
laws in the best interest of
the public at large.

Finally, we should get
serious about the
enactment of legislation
and equally serious about
the speedy implementation
thereof. Otherwise we can
throw them in a waste bin
- once again at the expense
of the poor electorate.

Leaders should ensure
that all elections take place
as stipulated in the
respective laws and not
be delayed unnecessarily.
We must bear in mind that
lawmakers and law
drafters have already been
paid for their role, and,
next in the line are the
implementors.

Let’s forge together
energy, scarce resources
and every second
available to put the
existing golden
opportunities to good use
in our mutual interest.
Remember that tuming a
blind eye to reality, truth
and facts borders on
selfishness and self-
enrichment schemes. We
should remember that
those political offices are
temporary positions.
