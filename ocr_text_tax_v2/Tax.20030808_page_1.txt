AFTER receiving my tax invoice for
the period ended 15 July, I noticed that
you [Municipality] have charged me an
amount of N$103,22 for “Open space
and street cleaning”. Before going into

After all, I am paying you people for just
that This will negate the effect of the
35,18 per cent increase a little bit. Please
do not say to me that this is illegal, as
your charge for this service would then
also be deemed illegal. Furthermore, any
cigarette and/or cool drink tin will from
now on be dumped onto the streets from
my car, as I am also paying for the
