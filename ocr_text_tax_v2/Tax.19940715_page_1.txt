There’s A Need For Class
Action Lawsuits in Namibia

THANK you for pnaung
Lucy Quacinella’s opin-
jon piece of homelessness
(‘Criminalising the Poor’,
24 June 1994). The Urban

the Goyerament’s re-
sources and energies
should be directed into
economic development

ford it, have to find legal
on an indi

8 ‘class’ to get an inter-
dict. The notion of bring-
ing a ‘class action’ law-
suit against the munici-
pality or the Government,
a relatively common tac-
tic by poverty lawyers in
the US, is unheard of in
Namibia. The Urban

in this analysis, but ifthore
is any legal or procedural

On the other hand

urbanisation. However
well-intentioned theér ac-
tions, most are often
planned without any pub-
lic input, the results to date
are the ‘criminalising’ of
the poor on 2 nember of
fronts. Ms Quactaclia de-
ecribes the first in ber arti-
cle. A second is that reset-
Ued squatters from, say as
an example, the single

ther out of town that many

who will privatise public -
subsidies.

Rental options, up-
grading in situ, and de:
creased regulation on in+
formal sector business
gelivities, rather than

home ownership, might be
options

towns? Why is there no
consistenturban land pric-

Ring policy thatencourages
mm cross-subsidisation from

high income communities
to low income communi-
ties? Why do regions re-
ceive flat rate budget allo-
cations regardless of the
inckdence of poverty in

"ity to raise funds from

towns in the region? How
can we encourage system
atic, open and formal! pub-
lic review of both private
banking and Government
planning practices?

The Government and
the municipelities and
towns are doing the beat
they can in the face of se-
vere resource constraints.
With more opportunities
for formal participation
and increased civil educa-
tion, together NGOs, com-
munity-based organisa-
tions, the private sector
payers may be able to s3-
sist the Government to
foster more effective, effi-
cient, democratic and de-
velopmenta! forms of ur-
ban governance.
