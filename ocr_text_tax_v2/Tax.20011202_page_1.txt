More Like Prison Than A Hospital

ALLOW me some space in your esteemed newspaper
to state my view on recent changes made at the
Katutura State Hospital.

The adjacent communities are experiencing drastic
changes in structures at the said hospital. All brought
on by its current management. High security fences
and electronic gates that will only open on production
of a hospital identity card were installed. The casualty
and outpatient departments are under reconstruction.
The main gate is relocated. All credit to the
management.

However, the hospital management is missing its
priorities. Ask any worker at this hospital, including a
large portion of the said management, and one will
tealise the grave discontent and rejection of the recent
changes. I am of the opinion that the said hospital
needs a board including active community members.
The latter will increase community harrier “iy
accountability to deliver a more co ty-friendl
service, something that is definitely lacking. This
hospital needs an increase in bed capacity, nursing and
medical staff and equipment.

Study of human behaviour tells us that structures are
there to serve people and not to control people. There is
no system men cannot beat. Just because any form of
development should coincide with the mentality and
knowledge of people, otherwise it is of no use to them.
What the communities around the hospital need is a
paradigm shift and not high wires. The Customer Care
Officer must do her work in mobilising the community,
informing them through poputar print and electronic
media of changes made to the system. This would
bridge the gap of ignorance between adjacent
communities and the hospital. To be honest, these
people have no vision for this hospital, no care for the
patients and only the nurses are getting the blame. This

hospital is being run by politicians who lack vision and
are motivated by power not to serve people. Imagine if
they ruled Namibia, the whole country would be full of
arrogance, high fences and electronic gates, the very
things we were freed from.

The entire hospital: has got only one
Electrocardiogram (ECG) machine, fess than five
IVAs, no laundry for linen and hospital uniforms, bed
and staff shortages, just to mention a few. I challenge
the management to reveal their recent spending for the
sake of accountability, after all it is the taxpayers’
money being wasted. These gates and fences are very
expensive to maintain and some of them have already
experienced mechanical problems. The physical
planning was poor and fits the Windhoek Central
Prison better than it does to a hospital. The other day
the bus could not fit through the main entrance and it
is unused until today. It is common sense that at a
hospital the emergeacy centres should be first to be
clearly visible and within reach, but this is not the case.
Pregnant woman are dropped by taxi at the gate and
they have to find their way, birth pains and alli, to the
maternity department, approximately 150 metresaway.
Not to mention stab wounds to the casualty further on.
It is just a matter of time and we wil! pick up corpses
and babies between the gate and the hospital itself.

Finally, regimes came and regimes went. The once
mighty Empire that ruled the world is no more
today. Mobutu was ruling DRC with an iron fist, but
he is no more. So was Laurent Kabila, but he is no
more. This principle also applies to the current
management.
