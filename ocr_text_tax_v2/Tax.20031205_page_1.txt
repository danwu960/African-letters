Time To Remake Our World

IAM writing this letter in connec-
tion with World AIDS Day, which
aas celebrated on December 1.
My points concern AIDS, HIV,
orphan children, street children,
elderly people and lastly the Gov-
ernment’s spending fever. In this
country we as Namibians should
remake this world from the top
positions in Government to the
lower positions and in the private
organisations and individuals as
well. .

The Government of Namibia
must stop spending millions on
unplanned and unorganised
projects. Why are Namibians
wasting taxpayers’ money on
these projects when the Govern-
ment does no even have the
money, which they are spending?

I was very sad when I came
across an article in The Namibian
of October 22, of how little chil-
dren are being killed by HIV-
AIDS and how orphan children
are increasing. It was said in the

article that currently there are 82
000 orphan children and that this
figure will double by the year
2015. And ofcourse another point
is the street children who have
nothing to eat, no place to sleep,
and nowhere to go. Is this prob-
lem the nation’s and is it not the
Government’s duty to do some-
thing about it. Should this not be
the Government’s priority?

The children in our homes are
exactly the same as the children
on the street who are asking for
food and what about the children
that are in the hospitals with HIV
or AIDS.

Can our Namibian Government
not do something about this and
bring these problems under con-
trol and try to prevent these prob-
lems.

Can they not do something to
ensure that these problems do not
escalate into even much larger
numbers over the next 10 to 20
years?

We have a lack of hospitals,
lack of proper education, while
our Government continues to
build in Windhoek and the other
big towns and they seem to forget
about the smaller rural towns.

We must remember that the old
people that we soeasily push aside
are easy targets for robbers and
murderers and if we don’t take
care of them properly then who
will? They now have hard times
in our country but they were look-
ing after us before and now we
need to let them enjoy their rest
and their pensions. We as young
Namibians should be caring for
our country and we see the Gov-
emment making lots of mistakes
and misusing their power and also
funds, but we do nothing.

People like us should be saving
the nation, we should remake the
world.
