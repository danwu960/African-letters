THE NAMIBIAN

ITIS worth noting that it has taken Mr Sheyapo some ten days
of solid silence to apologise for his public remarks on Namibian
womenfolk vis-a-vis their relationships with foreigners and the
‘kiss and tell’ remarks.

uncomfortable for verbalising an already proposed

As a foreigner married to a Namibian, suffice to i
remark affected me too and now Iknow only too well bow onan
their lips and fend for my children.
