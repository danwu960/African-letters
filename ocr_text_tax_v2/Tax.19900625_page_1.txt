The chiefs at the NBC could taken”
look at Article 95(k) of our country’s
constitution and undertake the pub-
lic service of encouraging the ‘‘mass
of the population...to influence gov-
emment policy by debating its deci-
sions"’. Let ordinary people, too, speak
through the electronic media

& project rather than trying to secure
entrenched spots for ministers on
news bulletins.

Many people hope that the NBC
Will establish iteclf as a media ger ;
inely serving the beat interests of cus,
people. Mr Emvula, Finan
disappoint us.
