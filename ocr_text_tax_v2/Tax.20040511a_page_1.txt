Air Namibia And Its
Exorbitant Salaries

I HAVE always been
critical of the develop-
ments at Air Namibia.
Icould never understand
why it was necessary
to hire foreigners as
General Managers who
did nothing but run this
company into the ground
by purchasing the wrong
planes, failing to organ-
ise an efficient serviceor
ensuring that the aircraft
was on time.

One of the managers
received an exorbitant
salary of N$ 150000 per
month and eventually
still a golden handshake
of a few million when
he left.

All he did for us was
purchase planes that
cannot make a profit and
thereby create a perma-
nent financial embar-
rassment to the company
and the Namibian State.
I always stated that a
Namibian management
team should be able
to do much better, and
now that a Namibian
management team has
been instated, the result
is that foreign users
of our airline are most
impressed with the ex-

tremely courteous and
friendly service they are
getting on the plane.

_ They are also im-
pressed by the fact that
the seats leave enough
leg room for the long
distance flights to make
the flight a pleasure and
they are impressed that
the planes are usually
on time.

It seems that the
present management has
really been successful in
achieving a turn-around
in the image of our
airline and that is why |
write this letter.

To show them that
their efforts are noticed
by the customers and
are appreciated by us as
citizens.

We can now again be
proud of our national
airline.

What one would only
wish, was thata similarly
competent management
team is instated at other
parastatals such as Nam-
Post, where we often
pay a ten times higher
postage for our letters,
which then either never
arrive, or even, when
sent by airmail, arrive

10 or 14 days late.

Students often do not
receive their notification
of exam dates on time
and thus miss them.

Shareholders do not
receive the notifications
of shareholder meetings
and income tax forms
are sometimes delayed
causing penalties and
irritation.

NamPost also thinks
they must hold back
letters that were alleg-
edly stamped too low in
foreign countries from
which they originate,
having the effect that
those letters eventually
arrive on your desk two
or three months later.

We need managers
in our parastatals that
can actually manage
and know what they are
doing.

Thousands and thou-
sands of people are
prejudiced if our par-
astatals do not function
properly and merely cost
us money.
