On the other hand MTC has had a exclusivity

main towns of Namibia with access to mobile te-

The actual crux of the matter is we want to have
the right to chose the network we want to use. The
last few years saw a series of price increases, some
over 200 per cent on the pretext of rebalancing of
tariffs. How do you rebalance tariffs by increasing

this fashion.

By the way and in conclusion, Telecom Namsbia
argues that it will experience harm when the market
is opened for competition. Surely you will lose
customers to newcomers but did you think that you
might even score increased income from intercos-
nection and of leasing some of the public swached
telecommunications network (beckbone) t other
operators. Another free tip for the Telecom Nampsbea
Top Management is to get rid of three quarters of the
managers and appoint more workers - then you
would not have to worry about competition.

After all Telecom Namibia Ltd. is an asset of the
State and in other words is public property and paid
for by the money of the taxpayers.

Congratulations to Willem Bekker and all others
who worked on the Draft Communications Bill -
with such a document on the table Namibia can once
again take the lead in the regioa.

Viva competition in the telecoms market.
