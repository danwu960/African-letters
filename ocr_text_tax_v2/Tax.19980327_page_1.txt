years ago. The society in which the carly man
lived, i.e. the primitive society or stone-age-soci-
ety was characterised by equal distribution of tand
to all members of that society; land was never
regarded as the private property of a particular
person but was collectively managed by our snces-
tors. As a result of natural evolution the physical
appearance of the carly man changed and simi-

members of this society contemplated ways of
enriching themselves, particularly means to im-

that end, i.c. slavery became a popularised and
profitable economic ideology and, for the first
time in human history, a man lost his land to
another man. The slave-ownership society was
later by “feudalism” as a result of a revolt
of slaves against the slave-owners.
