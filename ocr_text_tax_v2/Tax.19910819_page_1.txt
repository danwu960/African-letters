at thet time, and I arrived in
Namibia from Zambia in De-
cember 1990 while the regis-

tration count had stopped in
November.

When we arrived in Namibia,
we were taken to the Groot fon-
teen army base and we stayed
there for a few days and were
later taken to Windhoek for an
induction. But the programme
failed and we were told to go
back to our families and wait
tobe called. Up tonow none of
us has been called. We want to |
are to be blamed for late regis-
tration in these circumstances?
We stayed behind (in Zambia)
because wo were ondered to |
" and-not because we chose to.
