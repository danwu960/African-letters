IT is always interesting to note that
some leaders are not guided by their
own principles. It was during this
year when the Herero chief was
secking reparation from Germany for
the Hercro genocide of 1904.
Unfortunately. this could not
materialise because the Namibian
Government could not back the
stance. It was on the grounds that
Germany is pumping so much money
into Namibia and therefore the
_Hereros could not be paid again.

This stance was defended very
much by the Prime Minister Hage
Geingob. But it is the same person
who was of the opinion that Germany
should not pay. who is at the forefront
of spending taxpayersâ€™ money to go
to SA and to lobby for reparations for
Africans over colonialism and
slavery. Why?

Are the colonial masters not
pumping financial aid into the African
continent the same way Germany is
doing in Namibia? Is the inhuman

maltreatment, detention etc. of the
Herero not part of colonialism under

which the Herero were claiming
tTeparations?

This only tclls me that the PM is
playing the game of double standards
just ike the Americans who were
lobbying for reparations for the Jews
and now when itis directed to them to

pay (for slavery) they are turning their
backs.

When you are leader you should try
to be consistent. Because now one
wonders us to whether the stand of the
PM about German reparations for the
Herero was tribal or political?

You cannot be against something
and within six months you change.
Why? :

So one should be serious whenever
you are dealing with such issues since
there are issues which can be
politicised, and issues which cannot.
