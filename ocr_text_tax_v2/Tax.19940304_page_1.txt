The true leader

of Nanso and it is impos-
sible for Nanso to break

away should have re-
named their organisation
and not kept the name of
Nanso.

Do not intimidate
those who want to sup-
port Swapo. I know you
are trying to stop
Ndumbu but your or-
ganisation is not in the
interests of all students,
only some of them, and
you and the Ministry of
Education are trying to
put students on the
streets.

Ndumbu’s visit and
trip with the President
shows that he is the truc
leader of Nanso and this
is why his opposition is
complaining.
