The Struggle Has Served Namibia Well

1AM not new to the liberation strug-
gles of southem Africa. In fact I was
bom into the struggle waged by the
ANC in South Africa and married
into the struggle waged by Swapo
in Namibia. Now, when you are bom
into something, it is part of you and
you are part of it, not by choice but
by birth. The liberation struggle was
about peopte, land and wealth. It was
about the inalienable right of people to
freedom. It was about reclaiming our
dignity as Africans and indigenous
inhabitants of the soi! of Africa. In
fact the liberation struggle bas been
about claiming the right to deciding
our own destiny as nations of Africa or
at tholoast, having some inputin such
decisions. lt was also about everyday
“bread and butter” issues.

Tam sure that anthropological ox-
perts will testify to the fact that one
of the outstanding charactenstics of
populations is that they are not stag-
nant, but are constantly undergoing
dynamic transformation. The aim is
to ensure that this mobility is upward
and forward instead of regressing.

For the masses the struggle has
been about basic human rights. The
right to protection, the right to food.
clothing, shelter, education, health
care and the nght to free association.
Whilst each one has to take respon-
sibility for their own actions and
life, it is the collective that has to
ensure that the correct ere
and environmental milieu as well as
systems and structures are in place
to guarantees a positive contribution
by the individual for the betterment
of the society. Internationally it is
the Breton Woods Institutions that
countries adhere to and support for
the sake of having workable and
organised societics.

This immediately calls on the
individual who has the right to be
ambitious to exercise Tansparency
and accountability. Hence the adop-
tion of a system called democracy.
The adoption of democracy does
not imply the adoption of a western
system, but is rather the implementa-
tion of the best workable system that

contains an assemblance of fairness
and exudes a sense of ational pride
and a sense of worthiness and dignity
to the socicty it serves. Democracy
can be customised to suit that par-
ticular nation’s needs.

The world has become a global
village mainly dus to the strides man
has made in information technology
as woil as the affordability and speed
with which people are able to travel
from continent to continent. In my
own travels | find that people have
a keen interest in socio-economic
and political matters on the African
continent and the world at large.

What | have observed is that the
populace of Africa is no longer pre-
pared to accept any sense of embar-
ressment because of corrupt political
teaders in their respective countries.
This goes for the people's intolerance
towards despouc tendencies from
whatever quarter.

I have montioned the masses and
their interest when it came to the
liberation struggles. However, it must
not be forgotten that it has been the
same masses that produced a robust
and solid revolutionary intelligentsta
able to interpret and practice real
politics.

Having come from the masses doca
not necessarily assume thal those
with power will not be corrupted by
hunger for such power. Nevertheless,
these appetites are kept in check
by the fact that there are others to
compete with as well as ihe voice
of the masses to contend with. The
reault is that the best persoo will then
win. Owing to the ever- changing
dynamics of society, leaderahip will
also change because at the end of the
day, leadership is about the people,
the collective, the nation and not the
indivicual.

The aim and art of both politics
and religion is to unify people and to
ensure the sustainability of that unity
through service dell very. In any capi-
taliet society, “service delivery” Is a
popular buzzword because the society
isenticod, tempted and encouraged to
consume. Financial interactions are

tainly cheracterised by producers
and consumers and members of the
population interchanging these roles.
The danger bere |s that the majority of
the population will become consum-
ers instead of contributors.

Many times this leads toa situation
where a minority of the population
become very wealthy with the rich
getting richer and the poor getting
poorer. The electronic media play
a rigorous role in encouraging this
state of affairs even through their
soep operas whose emphasis is on
wealth and immoral living. ©

The bottom line is that in order for
anation to actively engage in matters
that affect it’s existence, tho elected
political and charch leaders together
with the bureaucrats and technocrats
in both the public and private sector
have to present the nation with io-
novative cutting edge programs that
include all af society.

The last ime I counted, there were
forty-two countries holding elections
during the year of 2004 globally. This
means that there is a changing of the
guard taking piace in many countries
including Namibia. Friend and enenry
have toadmit that Namibia has main-
tained a powerful sense of political,
civil and economic stability, which
together have contri buted to the peace
and tranquillity of the country. The
Swapo leadership has proven their
tenacity and political maturity ovor
aod over agaln when issues, which
could have got out of hand, wore
handled with great craftiness and
smartness as well. That is why it
thould not come as a surprise to thoss
who undorstand the agenda of Swapo
that the president has announced his
decision to bring his teaure as head
of stato to a respectable, dignified
closure as would be oxpected of any
great African leader of our dmo. We
can aleo rest assured thal bo longer
boing the president of the Republic
does not sntomatically mean that it
is the end of our president's politi-
cal carcer.

In fact for me it is the continua-
tion of a powerful career, which is

pow to take another form. That of
African Stateaman, especially with
the intoresting evolution of the Af-
rican Union and programs such as
Nopad. [t is statesmen such as our
president and ex-president Nelson
Mandela together with others of their
generation and calibre that make us,
the younger generation proud of be-
ing African.

tremain convinced that Swapo like
other mass based politica! parties in
the sub-region definitely has the in-
terests of the nation and the country
at heart. | watch with amazement
how some of the media mies the

when the main issues go beyond the
individual. The thing is that no mat-
ter how much the prophets af doom
ecream and shout, the people are ot
prepared to trust anyone with their
lives and their children’s future, but
rather those men and women who
unselfishly led the liberation struggic.
Let us face it.

Service delivery for the masses and
the previously disadvantaged under a
Swapo government has taken place
‘and even reshaped the landscape of
the country. [1 is a grew achievo-
ment for a community thal never
had running water coming out of
taps to havo this supptied to it. This
includes etectricity and roads as well
ts telephone lines.

The above have been the main
aspects of life that the community
has cried out for. The minority are
concemed with tax breaks, micro and
macto economic strategies and gov-
ommeont spending which is fine, but
many times the motive behind these
concerns is usually self-ceotred. Our
naticn lain the proves of:
afuture gooeration where wealth
no longer be the right of only ane
colour, but our children, black and
white will be ontiied to achieve and
possces weaith as Nerniblans.

It ig an achievement when people
who could never have expocted
anything in the past can own a ploce
of ground to build a house. ft is an

achievement when al} our children
are free to attend any school and play
anywhere and do not have to be sub-
jected to carly morning raids in which
their parents are snatched from them.
Itis an achievement whea the entire
tation does not have to be gripped
by a demonic spirit of fear because
of draconian td Laws.

Asa son of the liberation strug-
sie and a citizen of Namibia as my
adopted country and as a minister of
the gospel of Jesus Christ and an ex-
UN diplomat, | would like to inform
the sogmen of our society which bas
never experienced the real brunt of
apartheid to desist from demonising
leaders who contributed immensely
to the freedom of the people of Na-
mibia. | sense an uncomfortable anxi-
ety among some of my indigenous
Caucasian brethren. I would suggest
that we al! embrace this county as
our collective responsibility and re-
spect the government of the day and
mike a better contribution. It might
be wiser for all of us to direct our
evergies and abilities towards sharing
land and skills to achieve economic
independence and satisfaction as we
compete with other states for markets
It might be safer torealise that should
one sink then we al! sink.

Lot us thank Almighty God for
a country that is the envy of many
countries In the world and let us
commit to Improve on our previous
echicvements. Allow me to express
great respect and admiration for
President Sam Nujoma and those
around him for silently teaching us
a lesson and having the foresight to
unite the nadion by having taken the
step he has taken. Mr President, 90
one can doay thet you are a great son

wi vi i great
legacy of hard work and high moral
standards wil] always Jive on and
manifest itself in the generations to
come, Thank you sir for allowing a
pew dary to dawn.
