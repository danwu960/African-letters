LCA Thanks Supporters

THE local authority election of 2004
is history. Unfortunately the LCA
was not able to reach its anticipated
results. Only 34,98 % of the regis-
tered voters in Wi icipated
in the election. This shameful show
of non-interest once again granted
the existing authority the unlimited
majority.

We from the Local Community
Association wantto thank all ourcan-
didates, voters and helpers, especially
Jurie Viljoen, for their assistance and

th ivate individuals who enabled
us to run our election campaign with
‘their financial-assistance. The money
was used for advertisements, printing
costs, copies etc
Even if we did not reach our g
and are no longer represented
local authority, we together with the
Windhoek Ratepayers Association
(WRA) will keep a watchful eye on
their activities and fiscal policy. We

will comment upon the decisions
taken by this authority and should
any decisions taken not be in the
interest of the. Windhoek-citizens,

‘we will make this known through

the local media.

It is the money of the taxpayers in
Windhoek that is involved in these
decisions and therefore the citizens
have the right and the responsibility
to be watchful and critical. Help us
to keep a watchful eye by informing
us about any irregularities that you

your support. We will see y aie ar again
in 5 years time, then hopefully with

‘more success due to a bettér voter

participation. And remember, if you
have not voted, you by implication |
Stated that you are happy with the
current state of affairs as you did not
want to try and change things.
