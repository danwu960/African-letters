All History Traces Back To Injustice

THE current land grab being
orchestrated by the government
will have long term disastrous
consequences for Namibia. One
need only look to Zimbabwe to see
what a few years will bring. This is
the practical result.

On the philosophical side, inter-
tribal warfare killed and maimed
far more blacks than the whites
ever did. It went on for hundreds,
perhaps thousands of years. Noone
seems to be talking about restitution
here. This is especially significant
for the San, who were preyed upon
extensively by other Namibian
tribes, but are given no considera-
tion for compensation.

Wealthy despots like the Presi-
dents of Zimbabwe and Namibia

respectively have done nothing
for their respective countries. I
have watched the infrastructure
of Namibia steadily deteriorate
since 1990. Sadly, despite the
emotions that colonialism stirs up
in Namibian blacks, the majority
of material progress the country
has made occurred during that era.
Notsince 1990. Wake up! You have
only a scant 75000 taxpayers in the
country. How can the President
decide you are better off without
them? Giving land to untrained
peopic, many of whom are illiter-
ate, will not bode well for success
in 21st century agribusiness. Drive
around and look at a few black
owned farms. Like Zimbabwe, the

game is gone. Poached for money or

killed for food. Like Zim, there is no
real production to help the country.
The former black employees will
be reduced to squatters, living from

hand to mouth. It would be great if

all of us who are not wealthy could
be made so overnight. Something
for nothing is everyoneâ€™s dream.
Unfortunately, itcannot work. No
onc isalive today that was forced off
of any landin the 1904 war. No one
is alive that shot or hurt anyone in.
the 1904 war. ALL groups of people,
and I mean ALL, can trace their
history back to some injustice. But
only the blacks expect compensa-
tion, and only from whites.
