clerk, whict J Ngolombe signed

“Dear Mr Ngolombe, if ever there is
a town in Namibia with 100 per cent
Colonial past itis Swakopmund and you
Probably did not realise that January 27
was the Kaiser's birthday! Had

and so denied Germany its natural har-
bour, Swakopmund would still be ber-
ren desert and you would not be living
in Mondesa.

After World War I,
lost the activity and income of a
harbour. Over the years the eaming base
had to be changed. The temperature
and climate helped to make it an educa-
tional centre and tourist attraction.

For the latter the preservation and
maintenance of buildings from the
colonial past create an atmosphere
which is unique on the African conti-
nent. These buildings are not only pho-

Asian or American visitors but also
Africans! A notable part of this herit-
age are the street names, which are the
focal point of many a tourist's camera.

The tourist trade is the main pillar of
the economy of Swakopmund and hun-
dreds if not thousands of our citizens
are dependent on it, as well as numerous
handicraft sellers from African coun-
tries with their stands near state house.

As a trade unionist you should be
more concerned about: - the massive
unemployment in the town, and the
whole of Namibia; - the AIDS crisis;-
the shortage of classrooms and suitably

ing dismal pass rate after ten years of
independence; - the living conditions of
inhabitants in squatter camps like the
one next to Mondesa; - the increasing
crime rate, also in Swakopmund; rather
than wasting money you have noteamed
on changing street names and thereby
sabotaging the uniqueness of a town,
that you have not founded, but take the
liberty of living in.

If you want to eradicate the colonial
and apartheid past, you will put Na-
mibia with its present infrastructure
from prime position in Africa right to
the end of the queue. Asa

among your comrades. As a %
investor and resident of bed .
Swakopmund, I am under the imoreg:
sion that we who live here and the
business community whocreate wealth
and well-being for all inhabitants, have 4
no say in the issue of street namesand *
yet overything is made to look
democratic. In the end we will be agked P
to foot the bill for an and
costly act. How is one to the 4
daily plea by NBC on cone

reconcillation
other than cism? Hoping: TO
sanity will Ree hh oo :

you will have very few friends left ERICH FORTSCH, Swakopaad ‘
