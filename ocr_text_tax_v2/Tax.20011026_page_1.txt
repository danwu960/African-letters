: INresponse to the letters in the press of
,, some Namibians who deem it desirable
" w rename the old German streets, I
_ would like to pose the following argu-
ments:

1. With a few exceptions.the Ger-
mans who came to this country did not
rename existing African settlements -
“e.g Gobabis, Okahandja, Otjiwarongo,
* Otavi, Tsumeb, Kamanjab, etc. - so why
‘ should the streets that they laid out,
- especially in previously uninhabited
areas such as Swakopmund (which was
’ pure desert at their arrival), be renamed?
-: Why take away the identity of the found-
ers of a place which had no
-previous identity of its own?

_ 2. Whatis so obnoxious about neutral
\ street names like Post St (surely “post”
-Means the same to all Namibians -
‘namely mail or post office!), Breite
3(broad) St or Brucken (jetty) St?

. 3. Every town wants to be special -
but having the same street names in
“every town does not contribute to
Abe individual character of a place. Who
wants to see the same streets in every
town? (And by the way, do old build-
‘ings from one era really go well together
with street names froin a totally differ-
vent era?)

' 4. Is it really necessary or desirable to
‘spend hard-eamed tax-payers’ money on
gach a venture, while there are so many
pocial needs that the State needs to ad-
dress first? Is itreally necessary or desir-
-able to create so many extra expenses for
fhe business sector, which generates valu-
sable income for the country?

‘ Isitreally desirable to necessitate the
printing of new maps, new brochures,
: pew business addresses, etc? Would all
Wis effort at least create some new jobs
= ? And history is fickle - who knows,
sgome future rulers might want to re-
game these streets once again,with all

‘Each Era Has A Legacy

the accompanying expenditure and
effort all over again ...

5. As Mr !Garibasen put it in his letter
(published on these pages): Wouldn’t it
be much wiser to create a Garden of
Remembrance to honour the heroes of
the struggle? A place where visitors could
learn more about these men and women,
instead of names on street signs with no
particular meaning for people who are
not familiar with the role they played?

Alternatively, why not name the streets
of new urban developments or settle-
ments after these heroes? Shouldn’teach
era of Namibian history be represented
by its legacy, including its names?

6. The colonial history of the old SWA
is partof ourcountry’s identity - without
it, there would be no modern Namibia.
To eradicate the past, one would have to
pull down all the colonial buildings, rip
up the old roads, destroy the old parks,
dismantle European institutions. But
even then the legacy of a century
of European influence and education
would remain. Please remember that a
country without its earlier history is like
atree without roots - it is crippled. Please
remember too that there are several popu-
lation groups in this country, each with
its own historical roots and identity. A
common identity for Namibia cannot be
forged on the values and history of one
sector of the population only. An at-
tempt at this would only create further
polarisation instead of unity. In conclu-
sion: Is it really worth the effort to
alienate a small but significant popula-
tion group that has been playing a
major role in the development and pros-
perity of this country from the
beginning? And is it worth
all that money which could be spent on
so many more pressing causes?
