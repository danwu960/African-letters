The Flying Namibian

THE Flying Dutchman is an opera
where the captain and his crew cruise
the seven seas and are never seen and

never land anywhere.

This opera is copied by.the South

West African People’s Organisation
of Namibia orin short Swapo. Itcould
be called the Flying Namibian.

He is, all in one, the absentee
parliamentarian, landlord andmember
of the ministerial class, flying over all
continents changing hotel rooms and
cities and seldom being seen: He
belongs to the loyal cadres and is
therefore only responsible to the
Central Committee and the Politburo
and the spirit of Kari Marx. Some
have lived like that for 30 years - first
on the expense of the western or
eastern taxpayer and now the
Namibian taxpayer, for 13 years, has
been carrying their costs.

For the next elections this is an
unsavoury situation. There would be
no reason to elect them again.
Therefore one has to mobilise the
masses with different topics. One has
to produce other rabbits out of the
Chat Show cylinder. It is today, for
example, the commercial farmer or
the US of A. They are insulted
vehemently and frequently. They are
called coloniser, thief or exploiters.
For all these prattlers it’ would be
better to concentrate on some of
the rea] problems .

One would welcome the discussion
about the inefficient way communal

farmers handle grazing rights, the
lousy payment of their employees or
the shameful managing of their own
water supply, after having been given
free of charge the wells including the
necessary installed equipment. Where
is the study of the payment of
agricultural workers inthe rural areas
on communal farms?

A discussion about real colonisers
in the world, who are
other people in a brutal way by trying
to destroy their cultural identity, is

necessary.

Since AIDS is transmitted mainly
through sexual intercourse, an open
discussion about mating habits is
tequired. The sexual behaviour of
men and women has to change
drastically. What about having more
transparency, by asking people tohave
atestona voluntary basis, so that they
can inform their partner? Why is it not
possible to ask people only to accept
each other, when they are informed
about the status of their partner? The
regular use of condoms should be left
tothe infected or sex workers or people
who are changing their partners
frequently for other reasons. Why
wait for the international AIDS-
councillor caravan with their
programmes?
