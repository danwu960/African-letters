Could Not Vote In UK

quested the office in Windhoek to
Send me a duplicate of my voters card.
I called the office in Windhoek on
Monday and I spoke to a lady who
said they have send all the

cards to the office of the High Com-

Windhoek official said he could not
help further because he was nota mem-
ber of the committee which was deal-
ing with the issue of duplicate cards.
