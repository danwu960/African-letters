FIRSTLY, I wish to congratulate the
staff of The Namibian.

Secondly, I would like to express
tay point of view.

It is Bow over seven months since
the interim government was install-

except that repressive laws, such as
AGE, AG9and AG 26, are still strong
and alive.

Gentlemen, who do you think you

tatus quo

- ‘THERECAN BE no pretense. There
can be no cover up. Moses Kat-
Jluongua isa collaborator. Heis not
only a member of the MPC,
machinery set up by the South
African Government, the most ar-
ticulate member of a Cabinet pro-
tected by the South African army and
its secret services, but he also prevents
people from peacefully registering |
their rejection of South African col-
onialism and oppression.

Al a recent press conference he |
said ‘to give people freedom is not to
give them licence toturn against the |
State’. These fateful words is ample
proof, not only of the extent and
depth of his collaboration, but the
fact that he is no nationalist but a
mere reactionary.

However devious his rhetoric, his
capability to ‘capture the imagina-
tion of the majority of the popula-
tion’ has been reduced to zero if it
ever existed at all, For to be a friend
of the state is to be a friend of tyran-
ny, brutality, violence, oppression
and similar vices.

The fact that the South African
rule in this country is illegal, her in-
struments, the Administrator
General, armed forces and national
assembly must also be without
legitimacy. |

Nonetheless, Mr Katjiuongua sees
it fit to state that ‘we must be seen to
be doing the work we said we would
do for the people of this country, and
we must justify taxpayers money’. He
even finds it necessary to attempt the
propaganda that ‘the transitional
government has committed itself1o |
changing the country to make it bet-
ter for its people’.

The laws that Moses Katjiuongua
‘holds are the laws that virtually the |
whole Namibian population has |
dismissed as oppressive and immoral
and have fought since the orjgin of
our political struggle and earlier.

Surely political stability means
preservation of the status quo. Any
change brought about by the Cabinet
will be of the type that fits with the |
grand designs and. strategies of South |
Africa to retain contro! of our land |
and its resources.

Katjiuongua deprives peace. |.
loving men and women to make their | :
grievances heard in a peaceful way.
and asks these people to surrender |
their genuine aspirations for justice, |
peace and freedom in favour of |
. docileacceptance of laws which are | |
an anathema to their interest and. qo

wellbeing. 7

against Swapo on the part ofthe DTA
mouthpiece, I would like to bring the
following to the attention of the
public.

The facts about Swapo in that

mouthpiece are manipulated and

istic in nature. The whites

who sit behind this propaganda are

exploiting the lack of knowledge of
our people.

In 1899 to 1902 the Afrikaners
fought the Boer war. Let me mention
some factors in connection with this:

* the guerrilla war of 1899 to 1902 was
the first significant one in Africa;
*it was learned from them that guns
could be taken up asa last resort and
when all other possibilities had been
exhausted;

* 11-year old children fought in that
war,

* with their Calvanistic background,
ae saw their war as rightful before

?

* the Afrikaners did not separate
politics and religion;

* they were convinced they fought for
their country and freedom;

* the homes and farms of the

Afrikaners were burned down by the
enemy British;

16 are alleged to have died;

* Hensoppers were regarded as
traitors while bittereindes fought to
the finish;

* the traitors were sometimes
sentenced to death by firing squad;

* the Afrikaners were distrustful of
the English and their peace
initiatives;

* children of traitors could not be
baptised in the Dutch Reformed
Church.

Taking this into account, why the
fuss about the fact that Swapo is
holding their traitors in detention, in
much better conditions than those of
the Afrikaners during the Boer War?

Already, deep in the National Par-
ty hierarchy, inthe NP church, there
is a change against apartheid. They
are now beginning to realise the ir-
reparable damage done to the blac
by means of apartheid.

View the propaganda of the

Republican Party with caution. Itis :

the Broederbond’s psychological’

Serow suspicion ont Christian Ac
because an officer of the SWA Ter-
ritory Force is a member of Chris-
tian Action. This open letter is sub-
‘mitted for publication to inform in-
terested persons and the public at
large of the true facts of the
controversy.

MS GWEN LISTER:

YOU apparently have serious problems
with any pergon or event that is not in &;-cor-
requested in no uncertain terms tosubmit
tion, to ensure that Christian Action if not
victimised by a person's own, possibly incor- :
rect, understanding ofthe true meaning of
comment made by Christian Action.

You however

elevated to correspond with honest people.
You even went to far asto twist the little we
‘did say. Christian Action’s request that was
that you put your questions in writing so
that we would have a clear understanding
of your inquiry, and you would have an ab-
solutely clear ing of our reply.
The material would then have been very
useful to both you and ourselves should a

ing have arisen. Would such
action not have been more responsible and

professionally

You, Ms Lister, really have nothing
against Christian Action as such. You have
a tremendous amount to say about the fact
that Christian Action vehemently objects to
socalled clergymen who are more involved
with politics(and not even objectively) than
with their spiritual taske. It isno secret that
Steir a arma he Cal iefeerencnte
paapab efor the Lend You are seriously
mistaken, Ms Lister, when you think that
through naive mudslinging against a per-
son, you can cast suspicion on Christian Ac-
tion, amongst fellow Christians. There are
many Christians, Ms Lister, in this lovely
country of ours, who like Col Radmore are
genuine in their belief. Many are members
of the Defence Force, the Police Force, the
private sector, the state, businessmen, even
newsinen and women. |

Ms Lister, you go further in your attempt
at casting suspicion by insinuating that
Christian Action could possibly be con-
nected with the Department of INforma-

tion. Forget these tactics, they don’t work.
Christians have direction. They know what
the Lord expects of them, and they don’t
need to be ‘connected with anyoue or

Reply to Kozo

WE HAVE read, with interest, a letter
received from Minister Koscnguizi
typed on a letterhead of the Depart-
ment of Information, indicated that
even euch letters are done at the tax-

payer’s expense.

Minister Kosonguizi’s epistie is
what hecallsa “review” of our booklet
- “The Choice - Namibia Peace Plan

to preeent
Namibiens with the facts-and by the
provision of these facts and the
analysis of these facta, to
the commitment of all those who call
for immediate implementation of
Resolution 435 of 1978.
Koonstitutes analysis as well as ed-
vocacy. It stands however in stark con-
trast to the type of advocacy and distor.
tion of facts by the Honourable
Minister and all those institutions,
parties, groupe, persons end
mouthpieces with whom the

Tt presenis the truth in rebuttal of
the propaganda daily poured out for

Mir Kodonguizi’s cause and financed by

millions, if not billions of Rand from

the pockets of the South African and

Namibia taxpayers, and in the case of

Namibia - without the consent of the

taxpayers and without the consent of
. Namibians.

If over there was denigration

without facts and without reason, you
eee it in the Minister’s letter which is

tion? Thie matter is dealt with ade-

quately in our booklet and readers are
referred to it.

We canal! agree that a constitution
is one of the most important pillars of
a stable democratic state - if not the
very foundation of it. But surely such
an important besic document must
represent the will of the people of
Namibia otherwise it will have to be
imposed and then it will not be worth
the paper on which it is written. To
represent the will of the people, it
follows that only truly elected
representatives of the people can
represent the will of the people.

And to elect such representatives of
the people who will then draw up acon-
stitution for Namibia, in the exercise
of their self-determination and right
to independence, is the very aim and
essence of Resolution 435 of 1978.

representatives,
could be a further election for the first
government of Namibia in termeofthe

to be decided upon by at least a two-
thirds majority.
So it is clear that even here a com-

end your government's plan of action
for eelf-determination and

1978 because then you can attack and
denigrate Swapo in their presence in
front of the Namibian people The
peace plan provides for the return of all
refugees and one can imagine the
many witnesses then becoming
available to substantiate these
charges, iftrue Why miss such an ex-
cellent opportunity to free the tortured
refugees and confront Swape face to
face? The Namibian people can then be
the judges. When the Honourable
Minister denigrates Swapo, he should
remember that he himself set out the
options for Namibian resistance after
the 1966 World Court decision on
Namibia, when in an article ip African
Forum, he declared: “7x fact, the deci-
sion of the International Court of
Justice has had one positive resuit: It

four: In the political realm the choices

puppets and mase media continue to
deceive and mislead Namibians as to
the true situation in our country.

- I feel deeply hurt at the loss of lives
of innocent civilians at Oshakati. it is
not the first time that the people of
Namibia are intimidated, harrassed
and killed by the racists of Pretoria.

Who was responsible? There are
many instances as examples; 1981
bomb blast at Oshakati Post Office, for-
tunately noinjuries; 1998 bomb blagt
at Okatana service Station, killing two
Americans and a loca] businessman,
Mr Nakambonde; 1985 bomb blast at
Ondangwa Poet Office, killing many
people including children; 1985 bomb

blast atthe Ongwediva Training Cen-
tre, fortunately no casualties; 1996 s0-
meone tried to plant a-bomb at Mr
Frans Indongo’s Continental Super-
market, fortunately he wascaught red-
‘handed and felt very ashamed; 1986
security forces tried to a bomb fdr
CDA President Peter Kalangula, but
this too failed.
Further still, there are many, many
Namibians who have either been kill- |
edor whodisappeared,andlamciting
the following examples; Mathias
Ashipembe, David Sheehama,
Fillemon Elifas, Joseph Dumeni and
many others. These are merely some
examples of atrocities committed by
South Africa against the people of |
Namibia, and for which Swapogetsthe |
blame. |
Many Namibiansdo not have homes
or property any more, as these have
been destroyed by the racist’s Casspirs.
Swapo has never committed any such |
act against the people of this country,
| which we cannot say about South:
Africa. Racist South Afriea is to he
blamed for numerous atrocities
against Namibians, and Icalluponthe

its wealth for their own bene-
fit. But the people of Basibia
were strong. For many years
they fought against colonial
mule under BAPPA, the Ba-
sibian Peoples Party. After a
long and painful struggle,

Basibia finally won its inde-~
pendence. Now the Basibian |

people were free to shape their
own nation.

‘Now we can be just like
other nations in Africa”, said
some of the people. “Ob no”,
said others, “we must lea
from our brothers and sisters.
We will follow their successes
and avoid their mistakes”.

Basibia adopted a
constitution that was admired
all over the world because it
made Basibia a true democ-

racy.

BAPPA swept to victory in
Basibia’s first election as an
independent nation because
it promised to live up to its
name as a people's party. Its
eléction posters said ‘United
We Stand, Divided We Fall’
and ‘Build a New Basibia for
all Basibians’.

The leader of BAPPA be-
came the first President of
Basibia. He loved the people
of Basibia and was much loved
by them.

“We are all Basibians to-
gether”, be said. “Every man,
woman and child in this na-
tion is my family, and I will
not rest while any of my people
are suffering”.

“That ia fine”, said some of
the members of BAPPA, ‘“‘but
now we nrust talk about our
salaries. To keep the peace,
we have promised all the gov-

their salaries will not be re-
duced. So we must pay our-
selves at least as ofuch as
they are getting, or perhaps
even more”.

“No”, said the President
“those people were robbing
our country. Why should we
follow in their footsteps? Be-
cause we work for the gov-
emment, we are given houses
to live in while many of our
people are homeless. The state
even gives us pensions and
medical aid. We will pay
ourselves modest salaries. And
J have State House fo live in
and a government caf to travel
in-I will be well taken care
6f. My salary must be the
lowest of ali”.

4 “Bat, Comrade President”,
6 others cried, “you can't

the world!” Ye

The next day some of the
President’s advisors came to”
talk to him about cars for the -
government. “Of course,
Benz's”, they said. “The Ba-
sibian people would like to
see usin cars that will suit our
status as leaders”.

“No”, said the President, “I
do not think so. We will need
transport, but we must save
as much money as possible
for developing our nation. No
one working in this govern-
ment is going to drive a fancy

_ car”.

‘But Comrade President”,
they aid, “all the highest
government officials before
independence drove expen-
sive cars. And so do Heads of
State all over the world!”

“Yes”, said the President
“but we will be different. We
will set an example. A true
leader does not separate
himself from the people. You
must remember that most of
the peopk of Basibia cannot
afford a car at all. Find us
some inexpensive cars that
will get us where we need to

0”.

‘Now, Comrade President”,
said the advisors, ‘we need to
build a new place for Parlia-
ment to meet’.

_ “But why?”, said the Presi-
dent. ‘Is there no place where
we can gather to do our work?”

“Yea”, they said, “but it iz
old and dingy and we will be
crowded there. We want a
fancy room with anew carpet
and leather chairs”.

“No”, said the President, “T
will not spend any money on
government buildings until
every single person in our
nation has a home to live in.
Until thatday, we must get by
with what we have”.

The next day the President's
advisors were back again.
“Comrade President”, they
said, “we will have to make
many trips to other countries.
We must share ideas and
discuss issues and make agrec-
ments with the people of other
nations”.

‘This is true”, said the Presi
dent, “we must do some trav-
elling. But we must always
think of saving money. None
of my ministers will fly first
class, and we will always stay
in the cheapest hotels”.

“But Comrade President”,
they said, “a government min-
ister must travel in style. You
would not want your minis-
ters to be crowded and un-
comfortable”.

And the President said “how
can you talk about being
crowded and uncomfortable _

Yes”, said the President,
“but we did not fight alone.
Would any of us be here in
government today if we had
not had the support of our
people? All Basibians deserve
the reward of a new Basibia
where all can prosper”.

“But, comrade President”,
they said, “no other country
in the world operates this way.
We will be the laughingstock
of Africa”.

“No”, said the President,“

In the. face of. the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an R&O mil
lion jet for the Government
and officials of the Republic
of Namibia, I was: faced with
several questions which I coud
not help to answer.

I fully concur with the fact
that our country faces mumer-
ous problems, some short term
and others long teem. Take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane.

Now the question is whether
it is true that those ‘Muayon-

education and literacy train-
ing and development projects
and social security payments
for the old and unemployed.
Tt was not long before the
standard of living of every
single person in Basibia had
risen. No one was hungry.
Children were healthier.
Everyone in Basibia had «
home, and almost everyone
could read. And the govern-
menthad been so careful with
its money that Basibla was
not dependent on foreign ald.

ems’ money?

This country has inherited
a debt which it has to repay
due to the misuse of funds
and the criminal war which
was imposed on our people.
Again, does Muyongo want
us to accept that the drought
and other social evils in our
country today are new hap-

Says Local Historian

HAVE you been to the Alte Feste
lately? If you have, then there is no
need to convince you that the claim of
Caro! Kotze made in The Windhoek
Advertiser of January 13 about ‘empty
rooms’ is aproduct of ill imagination.
If the colleague knew what a museum
is all about, her capectations could
have been different.

According to the International
Council of Muscums: *A museumis a
non-profit making, permanent insti-

tution in the service of society and its °

development, and open to the public,
which acquires, conserves, researches,
communicates and cahibits, for pur-
pose of study, cducation and enjoy-
ment, material evidence of people
and their environment’.

Therefore, a muscum is a cultural
institution of national significance
whose goals reach far beyond mere
the entertaining of tourists. And after
all, Ms Carol Kotze has no mandate to
speak for the tourist, or docs she feel
like a tourist in her own country?

which brought about this independ-
ence.

And if someone's head ‘drops in
shame’ in the light of the historical
facts revealed in the Alte Feste dis-
plays ‘since independence’, then obvi-
ously he/she is against the struggle.

The Alte Festc was visited recently
by a SA tourist who humbly and qui-
ctly went through the displays. I took

nial governor of Nantibia «AG. He «:
wrote in the visitor's book the ambigu-
ous: “History has many facts’. Indeed
history has many facts and many ironic
twists too. An ancient Roman apho-
rism says: ‘When the facts speak, even
the gods keep quict’.

As to Ms Kotze's concern about
attracting tourists and investors to
Namibia, distortion and silence over
historical facts will notdo the job. This

kind of approach transpired in -her_..

pressions of what she Called ‘tacky’
exhibition (Our Namibian Heroes) at
Alte Feste, includes the opinion of
foreign tourists and Namibians alike.
It speaks for itself. Just to mention a
few of the remarks most often uscd
over the last four months: Exceilent/
Very Exccllent/Superb/Fabulous.
These are comments of 38 visitors of
which 24 are Namibian, 6 from RSA,
3 from USA, 2 from Norway, | from
Denmark and 2°froém Germany.

Nice/Very Nice/Beattiful came
from 16 visitors; OK from 10 visitors:
Intercsting/Very Intcresting came
from 31 visitors; Thank-you from 7
visitors; Informative/Very Informa-
tive/Educational came from 15 visi-
tors. Itis impossible to mention all the
different encouraging words in the
book, but the positive remarks are
certainly a genuine indication of the
role of the muscum in nation-build-
ing and a truc reward for any muscum
professionals.

I would advise Ms Kotze, whose
blood pressure apparently riscs at the
sight of muscum cahibitions, to seck
inimediate medical help before she
has ahcartattack, for independence is
here to stay and so is the historical
peniciion CIE aE TS

Tourists are not a bunch of fools, to
whonrone ean sellcheapcolonial myths ,
like the one about Curt von Francois
being the founder of Windhoek or that
of the German Schutztruppe whocame
from Europe to ‘bring peace among
the rivalling Nana and Herero’ as all

It is evident, from: the litue impxo-
vised museum survey, thatthe tqurists
are interesicd to know the truth about
Namibian history. Thus, they will be
able to appreciate the real dimenstons
of national reconciliation today and
the moral and political generosity of
the Namibian people - a colourful co-
hesion of national characters who
cmerged victorious as a nation from a
difficult past. As far as foreign inves-
tors are concerned, they are not invest-
ing in the history, but in the peaceful
and stable present of Namibia and in
the hope for a brighter future, and the
price for today’s peace and stability
was heavily paid in the past.

That is why there is a saying that a

Silence) has for family of the late Moses Garoeb. we decided
to reserve our comment on his life until after the funeral.
Garoeb was given a full state funeral with a 21-gun salute,
Preceded by a public holiday. Flags flew at half mast for 8 days.
A memorial service was held at Parliament Gardens. BWS
followed the events with great interest.
History bas a special Place for any person who has been given
& special responsibility at a given time. The yardstick being
used is how that person has related to human rights. Garoeb
was given a key position of administrative secretary of Swapo
in exile, which he occupied for 18 years. The period between
1977 and 1939 can best be described as the era of terror and fear
amongst Namibians in exile. Upon his return to Namibia, he
was given a key position of Swapo Secretary General. When
Namibian history puts Garoeb in his proper place in its annals,
it will seriously take the details of the two periods into account.

‘After all the nice words have been said and all formal
statements have had their day, the crucial! question has still to
be asked. “Where shall history rightfully place Moses Garoeb
when the whole truth is told of how Namibians have lived in
exile, particularly in Zambia and Angola, and when issues of
hooesty and human rights are taken into account?”

Moses Garoeb was brutally frank and frankly brutal. contra-
dictory, a demagogue who sought fulfilment in hurting feel-
ings and: hate speeches. In 1977 during the so called Shipanga
Crisis in Zambia, Garoeb went to: Mboroma concentration

ants back to Swapo, many of whom had disappeared soon

exemplary privaic life and Garoeb had not been a good role
model in this regard.

When the UN Resolution 435 was about to the implemented,
with the demand that both South Africa and Swapo should first
release their captives, Garoeb went quickly to Lubango, gath-
ered the detainees from the different dungeons and threatened
that if they would reveal that they were detained by Swapo,
Swapo would deal with them in Namibia. At the same occasion
he “promised” them that they would carry the stigma of being
called South African spies for the rest of their lives.

Last year when some Namibians had started to organise
themselves into BWS to bring into the open the dark side of our
independence struggle. Garoeb called upon Swapo members
country wide to prepare for “civil war”.

In life Garoeb had carried a lot of secret information crucial
to BWS work. It seems he has gone to his grave with this
information locked up in his heart. For the sake of history, BWS
is eagerly interested to hear what Garocb had said about the
whole detainee saga during his last days of life. BWS had
expected that he might invite some of the Lubango dungeon
Survivors to his sick bed but this seems not to have happened.

We all know that it was a gross political blunder and sheer
shonisightedness when last year Garoeb tried to publicly belittle
the Council of Churches in Namibia. It was really moving to see
that during the funeral service his body was consecrated and
committed back to dust by the man he once so scornfully
characterised as a“‘non-entity”. However, in the contextof truth,
reconciliation and peace, Garoeb had left us with a very impor-
tant theological question: “What will you do if I tell you that 1
had killed your brother?” He asked this question last year when
he was addressing the striking workers in Okahandja. In es-
sence, Garoeb was asking, “What will happen if Namibia is
exposed to the harsh truth regarding Swapo atrocities in exile?”
answer to this question is that truth, repentance, confes-

Have Rights As Well |

- AFTER reading the article by Albert Kawana (‘Nujoma
- Best Insurance Policy’, October 23, pp 6-7), IT asked
myself why he mentioned the fact that peopte such as
he with only one passport would “burn to ashes within
Namibia” in case of war and instability, if he believed
SO strongly that his party was taking the correct course.

And he mentions that there are those with more than

one passport. I assume that he means the white Na-
mibians. Who is he to accuse them of being cowardly
and predicting they will flee their country and “‘look at
Namibia through DSTV from abroad’? (By the way,
DSTV is a South African company.)

You did mention this in your column (Political
Perspective), and I want to support what you said: even
the white Namibians who were born and grew up in
Namibia have a right to see Namibia as their home.
They also develop a feeling of belonging to Namibia,
just like everybody else claiming that Namibia is
“theirs”. Isn’t it their right to defend “their” country's
peace and stability as well? Do they have to belong to
Swapo to classify as “freedom fighters’?

Inthislightitis your and my right to speak out against
the Third Term, because we believe that it may threaten

Namibia’s peace and stability in the future. And itis our

right to convince others of our opinion by laying open

the consequences that the amendment of the Constitu-
tion might have one day. I also ask myself if supporters
of the Third Term have ever studied history, because
there we find many examples of what an amendment to
the Constitution can lead to.

To give one person more power has very seldom
resulted in what it was meant to achieve. And the
argument of Mr. Kawana, that the historic record of
President Nujoma proves his selfless loyalty to the
country, is based on a very naive belief. The president
is no saint, he is also only a human. Power is a very
dangerous thing when given to one human.

I would like toend with an appeal to you: please carry
on with your effort to bring people to their senses. Ican
only hope that people like you will always be assured
freedom of expression, and that our parliament does not

wish to change chapter 3 of the Constitution in the near
future.

The prevailing situation
then was one of oppres-

human rights for the
greater majority of the
black and coloured popu-

were laws instituted such
38 job reservations, Bantu
education and numerous
pass laws restricting the
movement and abode of
citizens merely on the col-
our of their skins.

One could not get cer-
tain categories of jobs, no
matter how qualified you
were. One could not pur-
chase or own property or
land no matter how much
money you had. One
could not attend any
school or academic insti-
tution. This circum-
stances were degrading,
humiliating and restrict-
ing the human spirit of
our people for generation

fairly. It was a vision
where no one tribe would
again try to dommate over
the others. It was also a
vision where all

pressed population.
Swapo’s vision of a just
political, social and eco-
nomic society for all eth-
nic groups in the Land was
hailed countrywide.

in this new nation stood
tall with pride at the low-
ering of the flag of the
Republic of South Africa
and when this new na-
tion’s flag was hoisted.
They said to one an-
other the old saying of the

Negroes in America, “We

have overcome”. They

said to one another, “We
are victorious” and then
they made a pledge:

“Never shall we allow

Apartheid and discrimi-

country again”, and eve-
rybody then joined in
unity and said, “Let free-
dom reign, let peace
reign, let unity reign.”
This country is Namibia.

However, something
then went ternbly wrong
and the aspirations of
many and their dreams
have become only illusion
and myth instead of real-
ity.

As we go back and Jook
back at Namibia’s nine
years of independence |
cannot do otherwise than
feel a sense of being a
failure as a Namibian.
This is because at our in-
dependence we said to
one another that we have
everything under control;
‘indeed, we were told by
our leaders, “We have

bern. in, the in

community long enough
not to repeat the mistakes
made by others.”

Laudably our leaders
introduced the policy of
national reconciliation.
Yes, we adopted a consti-
tution that has become a
role model not only in
Africa but indeed in the
world at large, However,
something just went
wrong and nine years
Jater Namibia has lost its
identify as a nation.

I know that speech af-
ter speech will be given
by our leaders during our
independence celebra-
tions over the weekend
and we will be told that
everything is just fine.

Where Are
We Headed?

TAKING a close hook at what is lappening in our
region and in Namibia in particular as far as lead-
ership and politics are concerned» I would like to
point out two things that are ineveasingly becom-
ing a threat to our democracy.

TOLERANCE - Namibians have seen a growing
number of cases where politiciana;especially in the
ruling party, have exhibited insolerance. This hap-
pened after the launch of the new. party and there
was namecalling, especially abowsBen Ulenga.

Launching a political party issin line with the
Namibian Constitution and doeanot infringe on any
persona or other party's right of existence.

CENSORSHIP - The fact thasState-owned me-
dia are always reporting in favous-of Government
and the ruling party is.a.clear indication that there
is a great deal of censorship in theemedia. The state
is footing their bill, but as a taxpayer I want to be
fed with real, correct-and factaalvinformation and

news. .

Hearing lines like ‘the jegitimate-government of
President Kabila’ on NBC makes: me laugh. What
makes Kabila’s government- legitimate one? Is it
because it was brought to powentiirough the barre!
of a gun? fs it because Kabila overthrew:a long time

understand the situation better than other Na-

and the Opposition's views.

’ But all these are partially right or wrong and the
ruth of the matter is that if you harbour bad
feelings about others you end up getting hated
yourself!

The tribal animosity that the Linyanti tribal
authority has been nurturing.

The amalgamation of tribes into a single Mafwe
tribe, the conflict that raged on between the
Masubia and the Mafwe which later spilled over to
the Mayeyi and saw a spat of roadblocks, beatings,
shootings and the killings of two teachers, one at
Sachona and one at Linyanti, the resistance against
the government, threats of death and finally the
flight to Botswana are all signs of the times and a
bad outcome. ,

himself. Ihave strong beliefs that human rights are
universal.

Both the dying and living have rights that need
to be recognised equally. We know lawyers are
making money out of the situation, but this should
not undermine the rights of others. [tis interesting
to hear from acertain lawyer that he condemns the
activities of the rebels but at the same time he is the
one pocketing moncy from the same people for
their defence - what a double standard. Would it
therefore not be interesting to find out how those °
photos got to the media if there was money
involved and if this is so to what degree is this
professional? Namibians should put the blame
whete it is due.

This was a very unfortunate self-sought situa-
tion, the security forces therefore performed their
national duties as expected of them. One wonders
what national role rebels were fulfilling apan
from committing abominations.

If you put your hand in a hole where a snake is
you should face the consequences of the outcome.
Let the government carry out its constitutional
tesponsibility which is the protection of the sov-
creignty and democracy of this country.

Peace is a precious commodity and cannot be
allowed to be messed up by those who think they
can take out their frustrations on innocent citizens.
call on all peace loving Namibians to stand with

government to defend the peace this country has
dearly earned.

There are of course many ways of achiev-
ing peace. Our Prime Minister on Febru-
ary 22 2000 addressed the nation in the
National Assembly and listed all efforts
by the Namibian Government and the
intemational community in achieving
peace in Angola. The role played by
Namibia was no secret. It was public
knowledge just as it currently is. Who
didn’t know that Unita leader Jonas
Savimbi was invited to Namibia in Auv-
gust 1996? All other meetings arranged
with Unita officials were also made pub-
lic.

The excuse that banditry activities are
as a result of the logistic support offered
to the FAA is rather misleading. Unita’s
banditry activities were reinforced by
the fact that Unita is on the Tun, cut off
from logistical and other supplies which
resulted in sheer desperation and
criminality.

The Government has a Tesponsibility
to protectits citizens, and maintain peace
and stability which is being threatened
aS aresult of Savimbi's unwillingness to
comply with internationally brokered
peace agreements for his country.

I, therefore, think that we all owe it to
the Angolan people to assist them in
obtaining genuine peace and stability in
their country, which otherwise we woald
not enjoy as long as Unita continues to
be led by Jonas Savimbi. All we need at

sponsi

ing to correct the dangerously irre-
Dax

ble statements made one Alfred

- a Swapo backbencher inthe Neseee Ceenas
This man is clearly showing his ignorance that the
Swapo reconciliation policy is a total sham meant to
deceive the people of Namibia. Itis also very clear to us
that he has been appointed to launch a racist attack
against the Rehoboth Basters.

I shall hereby try and sketch to Mr Dax how the Baster
people have come to ultimately settle in the Rehoboth of
today. | am not sure whether Mr Dax can grasp to
historical facts that I am going to present but that is not
my problem. During the start of the 19th century both the
Nama and the Baster people who sprang from each
other’s loins, felt the bad administration of the Cape
colonial government. Together they decided to look for
salvation across the Orange River and outside the reach
of the Cape colonial government. There were many
streams ever moving northwards but the main ones were
the name groups of Witboot, Afrikaner and others.
Together with them were the Basters under Kaptein
Hermanus van Wyk heading northwards while another
group split eastwards towards Rietfontein.

It was a journey over many years of forbearances and
suffering without food or water at times until Van Wyk’s
trek finally reached the Rhenish Mission of Brother
Kleinschmidt at Rehoboth. With proper agreements
between the Baster Kaptcin and the Hereros. the domi-
that time in the region, the Basters settled

What Really Happened In Rehoboth

impossible for small clans like the Swastbools and
others to have occupied an area the size of the original
Rehoboth gebiet. In spite of this, Kaptein Van Wyk
Made agreements with Samuel Maherero, Jan Jonker
Afrikaner and others to ensure the peaceful coexistence
of the Basters with their immediate tighbours.

All that the history shows is that Van Wyk made
Streruous efforts to make peace among the warring
faction of Witbooi, Maherero and Afrikaner. He wanted
above all else to have peace in this land and security for
his people. He set up an administration in Rehoboth
based on the organised ownership of Land and property
and law and order. His administration started to delimit
and regulate the sizes of farms. The citizens santed
naming their farms and title deeds were issued.

Since the Basters were of mixed origin, all of them
spoke mainly German, Dutch and Nama. And they
freety gave names they preferred to their farms. Many
preferred to give Nama names to their farms, names that
still exist today.

Now along comes Alfred Dax claiming that farms
with Nama names belong to Damaras. Damaras never
owned any piece of land in the Rehoboth gebtet.

What we know from history is that Damaras initially
lived on the western hills of Rehodoth. This was a shanty
town built with rusted pieces of tin. The Damara inhab-
itants of that part of Rehoboth town were mainly domes-
lic servants and farm workers.

They admittedly lived in very adverse social and
economic conditions. To address this eyesore, the
Rehoboth government under Kaptein Hans Diergaardt
built a new and modern suburb on the castem part of
Rehoboth and freely gave it to the inhabitants of the
shantytown.

Today that modem suburb under the very same Alfred
Stephanus Dax is fast becoming another shantytown.

1 READERS’ LETTERS

I READ with interest and
some amusement your
editorial of Friday Sep-
tember 8 2000 on what

THE NAMIBIAN

$$$ ran ey Seem
WET yy) TARE BU Neen mee & cry va OF

letter by echoing the sen-

you referred to as “mud-
dling of words”.

Being a journalist my-
self, I know exactly what
you are talking about. I
have also experienced the
frustration of trying to fig-
ure out the meaning of

sentences and paragraphs
in media releases.
However, I have real-
ised that it can be danger-
ous td make assymptions
on the ground of statements
made in such releases.
Since you referred in
your editorial to a media
release issued by the Min-

Tf ""4@ 4 rns

istry of Foreign Affairs,
Information and Broad-
casting, I feel compelled
tO point out to you the
dangers of assuming the
meaning of statements.
You quoted me as saying
that: “The future of the
elephant that attacked the
tourists will be decided
once a fall investigation
into the circumstances of
the incident has been
completed.” From this
you deduced and even
suggested that it would
have been better to

straightforwardly inform
the public that the el-
ephant will be killed.
Youassumption, which
you clearly qualified with
“we think” in brackets,
was wrong. In fact the
Ministry of Environment
and Tourism has already
confirmed, upon the out-
come of the investigation,
that the elephant cow that
was responsible for the
attack would not be killed.
It is, therefore, clear
that your assumed option
was incorrect. The other

options that we consid-
ered were to leave the
animal in peace or to drive
it back to the possible re-
stricted area from where
itescaped, which was not
the case in this instance.
Being aware of at least
three options to be con-
sidered insofar as the fu-
ture of the elephant was
concemed it would have
been very irresponsible if
the: Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Information and
Broadcasting phrased the
sentence, which moti-

vated you to mention our
release in your editorial,
differently.

The Ministry of Envi-

mine what action to be

entire Namibia was colo-
nised by Germany. Sec-
londly, with the name
‘ Caprivi intact it was easy

for Germany to reclaim
the entire country back
after the war and review
all signed agreements with
Britain.

A name change for
Caprivi is long overdue;
it was supposed to change
subsequently after inde-
pendence in 1990.
Change is inevitable and
we cannot run away from
it.

Why the name change?

1. The name Caprivi has
no cultural link with
Namibians residing in the
region viz Masubias,
Mafwes, Mayeyis and the
San people.

2. Caprivicuts short the
history of Mafwes,
Masubias, Mayeyis and
the San people whose his-
tory goes as far asthe [5th
century.

3.The scrambling of
African history teaches us

- that most Africans come

from the Great Lakes
where the name Caprivi
never existed, hence it
only came alive in 1915.

4.The name Caprividis-
criminates hence all
Namibians residing there
cannot be called
Caprivian, only those born
there.(note: Caprivi is not
a language but a German
name.)

5.The name Caprivi
promotes rebellion and
secessionism since it im-
plies

Namibians who hail
from that region are from
a country other than the
Land of the Brave.

6. Caprivi assumes the
status of a different coun-
try, hence it is the only
Namibian region that sub-
jugates citizens, viz, we

don’t have Omahekeans,
Ohangwenians nor
Khomasians, why
Caprivians?

7.Caprivi should not be
compared to cities and
towns like Windhoek and
Tsumebd which explicitly
reflect their origin by
name. It is subject to
change without vote or
referendum to suit the pre-
vailing changes and de-
velopment, so as to bring
about pease in the coun-
try. Remember it is one of
the most troublesome re-

gions in the country.
8.The name Caprivihas

nothing in common with

Namibian people.

9.The name Caprivi
could have been a con-
tributing factor to the past
and ongoing tribal con-
flict in the region. Nobody
really knows its real mean-
ing. I'm aware the new
name may not make
Katima Mulilo clean.

10. Caprivi is the only
Namibian region, which
is not indigenous - it has
no historical background

with its people.

The name praises
Caprivi and his father
Zipfel and indeed the en-
tire German people as he-

article which appeared in the Friday (August 31, 2001)
edition of your newspaper titled “Minister snubs UN

I think the Minister did the right thing by ignoring the

Minister should not even agree to talk to them before
they publicly apologise to the nation or publicly ac-
knowledge that this report was a mistake.

we should show them respect. It must be reciprocal. Is

‘Answer For Terrible Tragedy

THE attack ontwo Ameni-
can cities is a terrorist act
of such magnitude that a
few words of condolence
hardly seem appropmiate.
Nevertheless, our hearts
gooutto the families who
have lost loved ones, and
the American people as a
whole.

This terrible act of ter-
ror highlights a number
of issues, which are dis-
turbing for all of us living
in the free world. Whilst
we can never justify ter-
ror as a way of solving
problems, the signs point-
ing to this tragedy have
been around for some
time, and this tragedy
could have been avoided.

The premature fingers
of suspicion are pointing
at Osama Bin Laden as
the perpetrating master-
mind. There are many
other groups around the
world who have no love
for the American admin-
istration, and these acts
could have been com-
mitted by any of anumber
of organisations, and not
all of them of Arabic ori-
gin.

It must not be forgot-
ten that Osama Bin Laden

is acreation of American
foreign policy, if there is
such an animal. Bin
Laden was aided and
abetted by America when
he was a member of the
Mujehadin when they
were fighting the Soviet
forces in Afghanistan.
At the time he was act-
ing in the interest of
America, and being sup-
plied with weaponry.
Saddam Hussein is an-
other American creation
(read Schwarzkopf's au-
tobiography) who was
supplied with weapons
and the very biological
gases that they now want
toconfiscate. These were
used by Iraq against Iran
in the eight year war be-
tween these two coun-
tries. The same gases
were used in Vietnam. It
must be remembered that
both Bin-Laden and
Saddam Hussein are Ar-
abs, and America has
made it patently clear
that it has no interest in
the Arab world, its peo-
ple, or its progress.
America acts only inits
own interest, hence the
military base in Qatar.
It is unashamedly pro-

Israel (read pro-Jew-
ish).

No country, which
postures as a world
power, can broker peace
in the Middle East if it
displays the kind of bias
that America does in the
that region. There was a
time when we merely
suspected that there was
this pro-Israeli bias, now
everyone on the street
knows it, and what does
that do for the integrity of
American diplomacy in
the world?

The Middle East con-
flict could have been re-
solved many years ago if
America had not been a
biased peace broker, but
the Jewish influence in
Congress and American
society generally, made
that impossible. Also,
American foreign policy
is not something that ts
clearly defined. It is, in
fact, and ad hoc arrange-
ment, which flirts with
the devil at the best of
times. The results are
now clear to see. Puni-
tive strikes against the
perpetrators will also
achieve very little.

Everything that has

tragically come to pass
over the last few days is
symptomatic of the man-
ner in which the Ameri-
can administration goes
about its business.

It is sad and tragic that
innocent Americans
have had to pay sodearly
for an administration,
which has let them and
the world down so badly.
Itis also indicative of the
fact that world powers
no longer stand on prin-
ciple when dealing with
issues. Instead compro-
mise is the standard and
ethics and morality is
being so rapidly eroded
that we no longer stand
up for our rights as equal
occupants of the planet.
America would do well
to look at why it was
targeted in this terrible
act of terrorism. It can
ensure that this never
happens again, and I
hope that its energies will
be used in the areas
where they matter most.
My condolences to all
affected by this terrible
tragedy.

PLEASE allow me space
in your highly esteemed
paper to comment on
America’s New War. Iam
very concerned about re-
ports that people are flee-
ing Afghanistan in the
wake of fears of a possi-
ble US attacks on alleged
terrorist bases.

Following the attacks
on American interests in
New York and Washing-
ton it is not surprising
that the US propaganda
machinery made this the
worst-ever story reported
so far in America. The US
media did not give acom-
plete and in depth cover-
age when innocents peo-
ple where massacred by
US forces in Vietnam or
in the Gulf War to name
but a few.

It is sad that innocent
people died in this attacks
but I just wonder whether
the lives of Americans are

worth more than the lives
of Afghans, Sudanese, Vi-
etnamese and other states
where people have been
attacked by US forces.
American presidents
should have remembered
that “what goes around
comes around”. Is it not
always innocent people
who die when “big” men
are fighting? Just like
those who are going to die
when Afghanistan is at-
tacked? The world should
wake up to the realities at
hand. The US itself was
labelled a terrorist state in
the past and it is exactly
what they are.
Remember what hap-
pened with Patrice
Lumumba and the war of
the Bay of Pigs in Cuba?

They are using Pakistan
and the sympathy of other
countries to launch a full-
scale attack on a sover-
eign country.

Ijust wonder where the
sympathy of the world
was when innocent peo-
ple died in missile attacks
by US forces on the order
of former US President
Bill Clinton in Sudan af-
ter the bombing of the US
embassy in Kenya and
elsewhere? It shows the
hypocrisy of these coun-
tries that are supporting
the United States in this
new war. One should also
look at the hypocrisy of
the Pakistan ruler who
came to power by over-
throwing the former gov-
ernment and its leader. He

is buying face with the
USA and its allies at the
expense of his own peo-
ple.

This new war is a rev-
elation that the United
States is an aggressive
state and retaliation will
not stop but intensify ter-
rorist activities against the
US.

How can there be peace
in the world if only a few
countries are living in
complete wealth at the

of the rest of the
world? I'm really ques-
tioning this new war idea.
What makes US intelli-
gence sure that these at-
tacks have been master-
minded by Saudi exile,

The US has failed for
more than four years to
arrest Bin Laden, a clear
sign of the weakness of
the US security, intelli-
gence and defence organs

rorism. I really think that
they are abusing the sym-
pathy of the world to at-
tack a sovereign state if
Bin Laden is not handed
over.

The attacks on the Pen-
tagon and the twin tow-

tion that the attacks were

aimed at what is repre-
sented by these buildings
rather than the innocent
victims. Itis aknown fact
that the Pentagon repre-
sents the military power
of the US and that the
World Trade Center rep-
resents globalization,
capitalism, colonialism
and other negative vices
which is still repressing

the rest of the worid.

Is a US attack on Af-
ghanistan really justifiable
if one considers the facts
above? | think they want
tomove the attention from
the failure of their intelli-

I AM sure that every peace-loving citizen of this planet
was horrified by the senseless loss of life when America
was attacked, but believe me some others were celebrat-
ing this massacre, just to remind us that we are living in
hell on this planet.

To every American who has lost a father, mother,
sister, brother, son, daughter and friend there is only one
being who can console you in times like this and that is
the Lord our God. Take refuge in Him since there is no
cross too heavy for Him to carry.

The big and powerful US has a long history of
imperialism which has created an established array of
enemies, ie. fanatics, extremists, fundamentalists, mili-
tants of all types. The US had been assisting people like
Savimbi, the late Mobutu Seseko and many African
dictators and the former minority apartheid regime of
South Africa. Also through the 1960s the Viemam war;
the steadfast support of Israel; and economic sanctions
and other steps against Iraq without stopping. All these
resulted in death of innocent civilians,

I do not support killing of innocent people whoever
commits such acts, whether they be fanatics or Ameri-
cans or whoever. However, the American people must
keep aneyeon the foreign policy of theircountry. If they
see that the policy is wrong they must make it known to
their government that it is wrong. If they keep quiet than
they agree to what America is doing in foreign countries
or they will continue to perish in such attacks.

The US will investigate this attack and dispatch
missiles accordingly to those supposed to be responsi-
ble for this attack. That will be revenge and in turn the
extremists will react again.

Revenge is not for human beings to take, revenge is
reserved for God. Since afterevery act of revenge more
innocent civilians will die. After all this who will be the
good one and who will be the bad one? Both will be bad
since they kill innocent civilians.

If peace and love could be bought with money America
could have been the country of choice to live in. Love is
to sit down and listen to the poorest person’s problems.
to try to solve them and assist to the best of your ability.
even those whu hate you. Let God be with the Amencan
people especially those who lost dear ones, to have the
strength to go through this hell. Let the Lord also be with
those responsible for the attack before they fall into the
same hell they created for others.

THE 11th September 2001 was not just a bad day for
America, but a very sad day for me, personally, and my
entire family. This is the day, we lost our dearest and
beloved father, Tate Joel Shikongo. May his soul rest in
peace and enter heaven. At any rate, this is what this very
terrible and fateful day also means to me.
Now, just what makes anybody decide to commit such
horrific deeds of terrorism against the mighty nation on
earth today or against anyone else for that matter? Was it
arevenge for the evil deeds that America has been doing all
over the world to others or was it just some act of mindless
terrorism by some mad dogs out of nowhere?. Either way,
what was clear is that the acts of terrorism committed in
America recently are certainly so hard to justify ... letalone
to be condoned by any human being with a mind, soul and
heart!. surely would like to join the rest of the sympathetic
world and give my sincere condolences to all the American
families and individuals who lost their innocent loved
ones. Any right thinking human would do exactly that,
except those who feel that America has been living in the
fool's paradise for far too long. By all means, my hearts
goes out to the victims of those human tragedies in America,
just like it does for the many poor victims of oppression,
_ diseases, wars, poverty and hunger, etc everywhere in
various parts of the world. I would therefore like to urge
here for America to look into the mirror, and see the real
image of themselves. Terrorism is the same, whether
committed by an individual or a government. Amongst
others, the real problems which America will now have to
solve is their often racist. arrogant, hypocritical practices

and double standards in the world: This may just turn to be’: -

, the real victors and durable solution to the problem of

shocked by the news. Na-

such painful experiences.

America is well known
for supporting state ter-

As a growing African

I have seen a lot - from
Vietnam to Nicaragua. The

porter of the apartheid

to death and buried alive
my people. Nosingle mas-
sage of condolence was
sent from America; instead
they went on calling us
terrorists.

1 don’t support terror-
ism, but we should not
forget that Washington
regards some groups of
people fighting for their

ew and better dimension. I
tin my deepest conviction
e Ilonga, a technocrat, with
leadership qualities, and
take, with a good political
the ideal candidate.

Tonga has an approach and
that has gained him great

fundamental rights or
freedoms as terrorists.
Once they called our
President, Sam Nujoma,
who is now ruling a praps-
ful country, a terrorist.

The word terrorist be-
came the right termtocall
any person or organisa-
tion determined to resist
or retaliate against atroci-
ties committed by the
world. If the Americans
really want peace in the
Middle East, why don’t
they withdraw all their
troops and go home? All
America ts doing in the
Middle East is oil exploi-
tation, creating confusion
and hatred among the Ar-
abs and Muslims.

Yes, you are a free so-
ciety. Don’t you think that
freedom is needed in all
parts of the world? I think
itis high time for the
Americans to learn from
their many, many mis-
takes and find a better so-
lution to problems be-
tween themselves and the
Arab world. When I look
at New York today, it can-
not be compared to Beirut
in the 80s were almost
every building was
brought down and many
families perished or dis-
placed. America sup-
ported Israel's aim to kill
and eliminate all people
in Lebanon. What did they
achieve? They supplied
both Iraq, Iran with weap-
ons to kill each other,

killed innocent Libyans,
Iraqis. failed in Somalia
and next, it will be Af-
ghanistan.

The collapse of the
Twin Towers in New
York has a bad impact on
world’s economy for
those who currently ben-
efit from it. The fact is
that New York Stock Ex-
change does not benefit
men in the mountains who
equally deserve to live in
a civilized free society in
countnes their own like
anyone else in the world.
The value of freedom and

My advice to Amerid

from a military solution
and think first before stnk-

ALLOW me to express my views in your esteemed
Newspaper. They are in connection with the ongoing
confusion of the Angolan situation with the main news
topic in the international political arena, namely the fight
against terrorism.

[ take this opportunity also to express my condolences
to the American people for the loss of lives on the 11 of
September events.

It is clear by now that the terms terrorist and terronsm
have to be redefined and a consensus to be reached
amongst all that belong to the human race. The way ahead
is challenging but also highly rewarding. Basic justice
and a dignified human life for every inhabitant of the
earth are at stake here. The concerns about state terronsm
should be given the necessary attention. For instance,
enforced disappearance and arbitrary killings of citizens
committed by state authonties should be considered as
acts of state terrorism. A typical example of such as state
in Africa is Angola.

The longest, bloodiest. and most destructive and largely
ignored conflict in Africa 1s being stayed in the beautiful
landscapes, hills and savannahs of Angola. I will refrain
from diving deep into the causes of the civil war that rages
for decades now, for they have been exhaustively cov-
ered. | am going to stick to crucial facts to refresh the
memory of those in oblivion, who still fantasise in giving
to the Angolan ruling party tree hand to continue dect-
mating the Angolan population and plundering the natu-
ral resources. For those, a little piece of advice: forget it.
Or at Jeast, think reasonably all over again. Here are the
facts:

- The MPLA did start the civil war fin 1975;

- The MPLA did cheat the general elections in 1993
and initiated the civil war II;

- The MPLA violated the peace accord of Lusaka 1994

by resuming military operations aimed at total destruc-
tion of Unita (its old sweet dream , by the way).

The MPLA leadership, who successfully metamor-
phosed from demagogic communism to venal capital-
ism, never had the guts, stomach and neither the slightest
desire in the distant past and now to face real opposition
parties. Why? The answer is quite simple: the Angolan
Cake is so awesome, astonishing and magical that it will
constitute a sacrilege to share it with someone else other
than the top few people of the ruling party. Thus the
current tragedy. In this regard the intemational commu-
hity, especially the Western countries that continue to
milk the proverbial wealth of Angola has done very little.
As a result the majonty of Angolan population live in
abject and sordid poverty contrasting, very painfully,
with the unashamed opulent life style of few ruling party
individuals and army generals.

Calling Unita and Dr Savimbi terrorists? And what
about the atrocities committed by the Angolan army
forces, security. the police, and many other paramilitary
organisations underthe patronage and implicit support of
the unqualified and non-elected president JES? Is this not
considered state terronsm?

Can you imagine the number of deaths caused by the
constitutional, military, law and security enforcement
agencies lawlessness. of the so-called Angolan goverm-
ment? Do you have any idea of the death toll caused by
hunger and starvation, lack of health services, uncontrol-
lable banditry and even lack of potable water including in
the capital Luanda itself, derived from the chronic eco-
nomic mismanagement, blatant incompetence, rampant
corruption, nepotism, of the so-called Angolan govern-
ment?

THE international campaign against
terrorism should also target Zionism.
We in the Palestine Support Commit-
tee (Namibia) believe that the Zionist
tulers of Israel are not interested in
peace in the Middle East.

Zionism is inherently an aggressive
and expansionist movement. Zionism
uses the dependence of American im-
perialism on oil to its own advantage
and therefore countries with the po-
groms against the Palestinian people.
Israel is a sub-imperialist outpost for
American interests. For American im-
perialism, ot! is more valuable than
Arab blood. That is why we say: No
blood for oil!

The ordinary men and women of
Israel are not our enemies, but the
Zionist rulers certainly are guilty of
crimes against humanity. All Jewish
people are not Zionists. It is a fabrica-

tion to equate anti-Semitism with anti-.

Zionism because Arabs are also
Semites.

This confabulation attempts to di-

mate struggle of the Palestinian peo-

or the oppression of Jewish people. We
are against Zionism and we are in sup-

So, perhaps for this reason, people in
southern Africa need to have a special
commitment to the Palestinian issue
because it could have been some of us
being terrorised by Zionism like that.

Where is the moral outrage when
Palestinians are killed in their hun-
dreds and thousands?

The rulers of the world have a selec-
tive morality. The state of Israel must
be replaced by a secular Palestinian
state in which Arab and Jew live to-
gether in peace. The struggle against

FOR those of us fortunate to be living our lives a
considerable distance away from the war in Af-
ghanistan, there is a certain irony present in the
vents of the past week. Plainly pul, is it possible
ustify the creation of peace by going to war?
“here must be casualties in any war no matter the
vcautions taken to minimise collateral damage,
und the inevitable loss of life.

There is talk of a humanitarian catastrophe of
immense proportions because of the fallout from
hostilities combined with the ravages of a crip-
pling drought in Afghanistan. There are sugges-
tions that food drops will not adequately address
the situation. Women and children are being
maimed in these punitive strikes despite denials by
the US, and the western world seems united that
this is the way to fight terrorism.

The barbarity of the Middle Ages ts with us right
now, except that death and destruction is being
dispensed at the press of a button in the clinical
surrounds of control-rooms thousands of miles
away. If Osama Bin Laden was the real target, then
real soldiers, with real courage should have been
sent tohis lair, toseek him out. There would hardly
have been any collateral damage or civilian casu-
alties. But America has no longer got the nerve for
real combat. Instead it conducts war games with
‘play-stations’.

Waging war is no way to fight terrorism! Bomb-
ing civilians and then trying to win their support
with food parcels is anything but civilized in
anyone’s language! If the total cost of the hard-
ware, the munitions and the personnel committed
to the conflict were quantified, then much more
would have been achieved by spending that kind
of money on programmes to win the minds and
hearts of the Muslim world in a tangible and
meaningful way.

At the moment the Muslim world is being in-
censed to the point that the gains the US are hoping
to make, will be transformed into even more anti-
American sentiments. We have seen how these
simmering feelings of alienation have manifested
themselves on 11 September, 2001.

The world does not need more of the same, and
the present American campaign will merely re-
duce Afghanistan to rubble. The result will then
be that they (USA) will fund reconstruction un-
der a government of their liking, until new feel-
ings of alienation lead to yet another generation
of hostilities, because the US listens to no one but
itself.

Like the Roman Empire, the USA will, indeed,
must. implode as a world power. because of its
outward-looking tendencies. Finding fault outside
its boundaries, failing to engage in any introspec-
tion, and gradually moving towards a society ham-
strung by curbs on the very freedoms that its
claims to champion, will lead to its own destruc-
tion. The signs are already there.

The problem is that America does not see itself
to blame for anything in the world to-day. Its
people, despite a reasonably powerful media, are
largely ignorant of what is done in their name and
in their interests, and the administration, with its
bullying and arrogant attitude, sees itself as the
kings of the world, unchallenged by anyone since
the demise of the Soviet Union, as the balancing
power in the world.

1 do not wish any harm to the American people,
despite their misguided attitudes to peaceful co-
existence in a world gradually falling under the
thrall of American power, but no one can avoid
what it brings upon itself, and therein lies the pity.

perception. Why is it that
the Taliban and Muslims in
Saudi Arabia, for instance,
interpret the Q’ran so dif-
ferently? Is it merely fun-
damentalism building upits
own head of steam on the
one haad, and Arab hedon-
ism built upon oil wealth
on the other, or is there
more out there that we
should be aware of?
Why are some nations

ple and their Administra-
tion, it is the psyche of the
nation that gives cause for
concern. In discussion

box does litte to change
the status quo. Many
American friends and col-
leagues understand and
share the concerns of those
living outside the borders
of the USA, but are power-
less to do anything con-
structive. Big Brother is
invasive and insidious!!!
There is abnutal streak in
the psyche of the Ameri-
can people. The USA might
be the moet powerful world
power on the planet to-day,
but it is not the most civi-
lised! It still practices capi-
tal punishment and ex-

ecutes human beings in the
most horrendous and bi-
Zarre ways devised by so-
called modem man. From
passing thousands of volts
of electricity through the
buman body to lethal injec-
tions, and all in the name of
justice, must rank as the
ctuellest indictment of civi-
lised norms and standards!
The American peopte have
come to believe that this is
how one exacts justice!
They tum it into aspectacte
by watching it on closed
circuit television in true
Hollywoodian fashion!
Can anything else be more
bizarre, or more bnitalis-
ing? Yes, watching Afghan
women and children scat-
ter for their lives while
American bombs rain
down, is more bizarre and
brutal!!
Nottotalk of weapons of
mass destruction! America
is the only country on the
planet to have dropped an
atomic bomb on another
country. The immediate
destruction was bad
enough, but what about the
nuctear fallout, not just for
Japan but for the region?
Did America care? They
fegarded that as a major
achievement in the annals
of technology and modern
wasfare! So much for car-
ing about the planet! And
the refusal of the Bush Ad-
ministration to sign the
Kyoto Accord, what does

that say about commitment
to the well-being of the
Planet and the rest of us
mortals who are not Ameri-
cans? And the use of agent
orange in Vietnam, was
that humane?

Mt is my belief that the
power and might of the
American people is par-
Ually based on their dam-
aged psyche. Institutional-
ised violence and brutality
desensitises them to the
feelings, aspirations and
sensitivities of the rest of
the world. A judicial sys-
tem based on brutality can-
Not creale justice, just as
war and destruction can
never bring about peace.

After the liberation strug-
gle, both South Africa and
Namibia removed the death
sentence from their legal
systems. None of our op-
pressors and persecutors
was condemned to death,
and no Nuremberg -type tri-
als were held to revenge
the deeds of the past, dur-
ing which thousands also
fost their lives over many
decades. Instead, we opted
for reconciliation, and we
are all the better for that.
This seif-same aparthe+d re~
gime in South Africa was
supported by the USA as
was Unita in Angola. Bill
Clinton's administration
went as far as requesting
the De Klerk government
to ensure thal no nuclear
technology felt into the

hands of the Mandela-led
ANC government, because -
they could not trust the new
black leaders! They were
happy to throw their tot in
with the white pariah racist
regime, but they would not
trust the new black govern-
ment.

No, we do not need any
form of moralising from
those who backed our ersi-
while persecutors. We par-
ticularly have no interest in
being on “their side!” Back-
ing ourselves certainly does
not imply backing terror-
ism and that is what the
Bush administration is so.
clumsily trying toinfer in its
Statemem that “we are ¢i-
ther with them or against
them!”

Americans need to di-
vest themselves of the no-
tion of revenge as a means
of creating a peaceful
world. They can do so by
distancing themselves from
their own forms of institu-
tionalised violence, which
they mistakenly believe tq
be justice. And they can
begin to show some regard
for the millions of us who
are not Americans, and who
do not share all of their
values, ethics and morals
notwithstanding.

AMERICA has always
presented herself not only
as a superpower, what-
ever that means now, but
also a moral power of
some sort. However, any
critical observer of the
American governments
and administrations,
whether past or current,
knows that their moral
and ethical banks have
been chronically bank-
rupt!

These are the very
same people who are de-
ceptively against terror-
ism and the use of weap-
ons of mass destruction?
Really, for how long will
these people continue to
delude themselves into
believing that they can
fool all the people all the

time?

What are they doing to
Afghanistan and the in-
nocent Afghans is surely
a crime against human-
ity!. But, who will pun-
ish this kind of modem
and technologically ad-
vanced type of terrorism,
when the whole world is
told to either be against
Bin Laden’s alleged ter-
rorism or for American
terrorism!

This type of moral
sickness is at the very
heart of global instabil-
ity and a serious threat to
world peace. Incidentally
Islam means (universal)
peace.

If Muslims in the world
get deceived by all the
sweet talk of Bush, Blair

and company that they
are not involved in acru-
sade against Islam and
Muslims, then they may
wake up too late to real-
ise that the Afghans will
have been nuked to death,
right in broad daylight.
America has publicly
confirmed that they have
used the so-called tacti-
cal nuclear weapons.

In fact, what is meant
by carpet bombing? What
do you bomb for over a
month in a country like
Afghanistan? What else
is left to bomb except ci-
vilian targets which they
fancifully call collateral
damage. In the meantime
terrorists like Ariel
Sharon continue to com-
mitacts of genocide, with

the generous assistance
of America in Palestine.
Isn’t this clearcut moral
bankruptcy and down-
righthypocrisy? America
must just learn to recog-
nise that that it has never
been innocent of global
terrorism itself. Terrorism
is just evil, even when
committed under the
guise of anti-terrorism and
under the American flag.

God Almighty tells us
in the Holy Quran, ‘Fear
them not, but fear Me”

MUCH is being said about
Angola but less has been
done to address the root
causes of its long-running
problem. The so-called
peace-loving countries
have not alleviated the
situation but have aggra-
vated it by fuelling the
war with the supply of
arms to warring parties,
sometimes based on bind
loyalty.

To put it briefly: after
the unceremonious with-
drawal of the Portuguese
colonialists in Angola,
there was an historic meet-
ing in Portugal. The three
nationalist movements,
Movement for the Popu-
lar Liberation of Angola
(MPLA), the National
Union for the Total Inde-
pendence of Angola
(Unita) and the National
Front for the Liberation
of Angola(FNLA) signed
the Alvor Accords on
January 15, 1975.

The Alvor agreement
provided for a joint in-
tenm government and in-
tegrated national army.
However, as the date for
military integration
acared, the agreement
broke down. By mid- 1975
the three groups were at
war and the US and Rus-
sta rushed to involve
themselves.

On May 3! 1991 the
Bicesse Accord was reu-
fred, calling for the Gov-
emmment and Unita forces
to integrate into a $0 000
strong military force. The
Accord contained a ‘Tri-
ple Zero’ clause which
prohibited eather party to
the conflict from purchas-
ing ocw weaponry, while
the MPLA remained the
legitimate government,
holding responsibility for
running the state during
an interim period.

Russia had been one of
the three observing
‘Troika’ members in the
peace process. But it has
also long been a suppber
of weapons to Angola.
The Angotan Government
had unul 1998 a S$6billion
debt to Russia, all of itdue
to weapons purchases.
After segotiations in
1998, such debt was re-
duced to about $1,$ mil-
lion. Because of the out-
standing debt, the deal bad
to be funded mainly
through diamond joiat

venture arrangements. as

well as some oil and min-
ing concessions and fish-
ingrights. Kazakhstan has
admitted that in 1998 11
transferred Russian mati-
tary equipment to Angola.

Portugal remains tied to
Angola by its history. Itis
that country’s main noa-
oil trading partner. The
Portuguese government
has always been partisan,
supporting only the
MPLA in spite of its posi-
ton as a member of the
observing ‘Troika’. (Por-
tugal, Russiaand US form
the Troika).

Under the Lusaka Pro-

Li"". oa a

he os om i

tocol concluded on No-
vember 39 1994, neither
President dos Samtos nor
Unita’s Jonas Savimbi
signed the agreement,
leaving it to their subordi-
nates to do s0, a sign of
their continued lack of
confidence im the peace
process. The abuse of hu-
maa rights contributed to
the collapse of the Lusaka
accord ia 1998. Serious
violations of the ceasefire
increased io 1997, the
majority of which were
civilians. Human rights

name the little comer amongst birds and trees, created in a
backyard-garden like , where I decided to take
a female friend to lunch for a chat over some usually good
and fresh food. The order was comprised of a salad and
toast for the lady. After having been helped promptly, the
waiting began. As the minutes ticked by one after the other,
I decided to enquire about the delay. One of the waiters told
me that the order was almost ready and that I should be
patient. | was amazed that a lukewarm pasta salad could
take over 25 minutes to make ... after all — to cook pasta
takes at most 10 minutes!

Eventually food was served at 13h40. After eating as fast
as possible without being obscene in doing so, I decided to
ask for the bill to pay for food consumed. Amazingly, fot
the next 10 minutes no waiters were to be seen anywhere in
the eating area! I then walked upto the counter outside, and
asked for the bill, clearly stating that I was by this time in
a great hurry. It was 13h58 already, and my friend and I

were going to be late for both our jobs. After waiting at 4
another 5 minutes, now slightly annoyed, I decided to

without and to return later for such. As ott

though - what service? I work in a highly customer servigg’

related industry, and thus am well familiar with the con:

cepts of customer satisfaction and prompt, efficient and!

friendly service. I would like to conclude in asking this: are:

we forced to merely endure slow and inefficient service in’

instances such as these? Should we, as the clients

customers, the consumers, andeffectively the money

better and more customer-oriented service? Upon

of being ill mannered, and guilty of theft, with no intentiog)

of resolving the matter from my side...
Occurrences like these seriously hamper the enj

of the public, and thus I am inviting the editor and the

readers to comment on such instances, and let us try tp.

resolve these problems. After all - what we as consumer

want is some quiet place to sit and enjoy our lunch, no

having to worry if the food is served on time.

ALL I can say is thank God The
Namibian didn’t accept Baffour
Ankomah’s challenge to reprint
his entire lecture in full. I’m all in
favour of fantasy fiction but after
reading Baffour’s lengthy,
obscenely self satisfied and
patronisingly racist letter in The
Namibian (not to mention
watching him in person blathering
away on Talk of the Nation), I'd
have to say that Namibia has
suffered enough.

Begone, Baffour! Go back to
your cruel exile in your
comfortable London flat with its
potholed road (not to mention
fancy restaurants, political
security and snappy boutiques)!

Or better still, if you think that
potholes are a serious indictment

of Western values, cut the poor
British some slack, hop ona plane
and leave them in peace as well.

Take your mercenary little rag
of a magazine with you. Open a
newspaper office in Zimbabwe,

I hear there’s one currently
vacant in Harare and you’ve got
the Zanu-PF government line
down pat. I assume that Mugabe’s
people pay you. Or at the very
least fly you around showering
you with free hotel rooms and

Can't. Can you?

One final suggestion.

How about returning to your
native Ghana? You can’t still be
in exile surely? Not after all these

years? Not when you love Africa
so much and know so much about
this great continent. Not after all
the political change that has taken
place in Ghana? And you, Baffy,
still in exile?

Or perhaps you are. Given your
morbidly turgid prose, your
depressing dictatorial arrogance,
your inability to write a simple

Fray Ocroaen 10 41

‘Big Goats Don’t Sneeze Without Reason’

ALLOW me space in the peopk’s
paper to air my views on same issues
that are not right in our country. I am
disheartened by the receatevents where
our commander in chief criticised one
section of our community, namely the
whites. Whatis happening? What went
wrong?

There is asaying, which goes: ‘a big
goa does not sneeze without a rea-
son”. If there is something going on
about the whites in this country then
we as citizens also deserve the right to
know. To blame people just out of the
blue is not a good thing, especially
when it is done by a person who is
supposed to unite the whole nation.

What has happened to our policy of
national reconciliation? Is it working or
dead? Of course it is the government
that brought itinto being and if itis dead
then we as a nation also deserve to
know so that we can also start criticis-
ing some fellow blacks who did us
wrong during the liberation struggle. J
lost my brother because my neighbour
reported him to the South African army
to be a ‘terrorist’. I have forgiven him
but I did not forget. J am also fully
aware of the atrocities that the Germans
and the South African colonisers have
committed againstour people but which
whites did this kind of thing? Is itGwen
Lister? Is it Hannes Smith? Believe
me these whites, Gwen and Hannes,
also suffered but of course not the
same way the blacks did. Just like
today some blacks are driving beauti-
ful 4x4s because it suits their status
while some fellow blacks are going

hungry with no shelter, nothing.

I cannot understand that 13 years
after independence whites are still
causing divisions amongst the people.
Are we so stupid that we (blacks)
cannot think for ourselves? How can
we allow ourselves to be divided by
others? Maybe there is something
wrong with our systems, which in fact
might be causing divisions and not the
whites. How many white farmers are
ministers today? How many whites
are CEOs? Of course many are com-
mercial farmers and is it this which is
causing problems? We have the right
to know.

Saying whites are causing division
while we have the full commanding
power to me is a joke. Fine, we have
the capacity todeal with them. Why do
we say this instead of just acting but of
course acting with reason? We must
alsoexamine oursetves before we stast-
pointing fingers at others. I think peo-
ple that are causing division are the
ones that are stealing the public funds
So that the government will be unable
to provide for its citizens. Those are
the people who need to be dealt with.
We must try to empower all of our
citizens. Let the whole nation enjoy
the fruits of independence. If we ig-
hore that we are just inviting more and
more trouble and then we will blame it
on the whites. Do not laugh at the
snake because it walks on its belly.

We must also understand that in a
country of beggars, stealing and not
begging is considered a crime. There
isasaying, which says ‘stealing brings

misfortune”. There are too many steal-
ing in government and no concrete
steps are taken. All one hears is pres-
idential commissions.

They are becoming too many now
and their findings are just gathering
dust wherever they take place. Don’t
we have the capacity to deal with
criminals

and thieves in this country? I sug-
gest if we have the capacity to deal
with whites we must also use the same
capacity to deal with thieves especial-
ly the ones that are embezzling the
public funds.

When is the six million Namibian
dollars going to be retumed? And who
is going to return it and how? Do
whites cause these things? If yes, then
there is something wrong with us, I
mean the black people. We like “nice”
things but we hate working hard. We
are good af blaming others but we
neves tum the finger on ourselves. Of
course whites are hard workers that is
why they have what they have today.
Of course some of them have acquired
their riches by exploiting us but now
there are laws in place that are prevent-
ing this kind of things from happen-
ing. It all depends on how committed
we are to such laws.

I know that whoever reads this letter
might say that I am an enemy of the
state but unfortunately I am just being
realistic. [am nota CoD, nora DTA or
a RP. I am just myself with my own
do not have their own brain will want
to shut me off. Let’s not blame the

whites but rather blame ourselves for
our own misfortune. These days the
comrade is not always right because
some comrades are hungry and they
are doing whatever they can do to be
like other comrades. What are the 17
farms for?

Tt must be clear to each and every
Namibian, whether you are black or
white, Herero or Ovambo, Damara or
Caprivi, Nama or Tswana, San or Ka-
vango, Himba or others that Namibia
is independent forever. Hans Dreyer,
Koevoet, SWATF, SADF and Bothas
ase gone forever. If ever they will
come back we should blame it on
ourselves and not on the whites.

God created us with a brain to dis-
tinguish between what is right and
what is wrong. If you let yourself be
misled, blame it on yourself. The pot-
iticians should also stop working on
our emotions and feelings. We know
how hard it was during the liberation
struggle. We were there when our
homes were destroyed and burned
down. We were there when our ma-
hangu fields were destroyed. We were
there when our own children were
killed. We were there at Niimwandi.
We know all these things. To tell us
these days that whites are bad while
you are enjoying their company at
your farms and in your neighbour-
hood is just a joke to us.

We know how dusty itis in Katutura
but we are still there. We know all
those things and we also know that
Namibia is unfortunately a mother for
all of us. All we need to hear now is

economic development, peace and sta-
bility, employment opportunities and
projects so that we can develop our
community.

We don't want to bear hate speech-
es. We know how bad and terrible the
war was. We don’t want WAR, we
want PEACE.

We must remember that there is no
lion which cannot miss a chase, and
there is no pond that the sun cannot dry.
Life is when you are together, alone
you are an animal. In Oshiwambo there
is saying that says “Pombili iha pa
potwa!"" Translate it yourself.

Let us all work together and be
united as we were during the dark days
of the liberation struggle. Whites are
not enemies today but our enemies are
hunger, disease, poverty, ignorance,
nepotism, tribalism, hatred, cormup-
Gon, sexism, self-centeredness etc. The
list is too long. Namibian develop-
ment needs us all. We cannot talk of
development if we are blaming and
attacking other people. If we keep on
blaming whites, they may say, “though
1am not edible says the vulture, yet
nurse my eggs in the branches of a
high wee because man is hard to be
wusted.” I hope we don't want this to
happen. We must also remember “he
who finds the occasion to hurt others
will be hurt by them tomorow. We
don’t want this to happen either.

Let us build and develop our Na-
mibia. Viva the Republic of Namibia

If instead, you focus on positive

Man Be Called To Order?

THIS is miy reply to the Namibia
Today article titled ‘It is high time
for Phil ya Nangoloh to be called to
order’ published in the Swapo
mouthpiece on November 21 2003.

Asapeace loving Namibian I read
with concem the above mentioned
article which shows the intolerance
of some of the Swapo people towards
human rights and democracy in this
country. In an attempt to silence
Namibta's only vibrant and fearless
human rights organisation and its
executive director, Swapo through
its mouth piece Namibia Today urged
subordinates that “It is high time for
Phil ya Nangoloh to be called to
order”,

I ask myself why the NSHR
director should be “called to order”?
The article made some allegations
about what Swapo claims to be
“fabricated stories”.

Please allow me space in your
newspaper to respond to the said
claim directed at Phil ya Nangoloh,
in particular, and the NSHR, in
general. I want to correct these
misleading and misdirected
allegations.

Swapo claims that Ya Nangoloh
“fabricated” stories with the purpose
of “discrediting Namibian security
forces” because the NSHR made
several reports that Namibian and
Angolan security forces have killed
innocent Angolans during the recent
conflict in the Kavango and Caprivi.
Everybody knows by bow thateither
through eyewitness reports or
through the reports by Amnesty
Intemational, Human Rights Watch
and the NSHR that there were several
killings committed by the Namibian
security forces both in Namibja and
Angola. Even recently a member of
the Namibian security forces, a
certain SFF commander, testified in
the High Court that he and other
Namibian security force members
were given orders and have carried
out such orders to shoot and kill
people during the night in the
Kavango region.

As for the Swapo question orclaim

thatthe government should not worry
about ineffective groups like Tagoma
referring to the recent murder of
Tagoma leader Shevanyenga, I
would like to say this to Swapo: the
late Mr Shevanyenga was a

Namibian citizen like everyone else *

and the government is held
responsible for the security of every
Namibian. Therefore I see no point
for several government and Swapo
leaders to.issue death threats to an
ineffective group which finally led
to Shevanyenga’s death.

Thirdly, Swapo accused Mr Phil
ya Nangoloh to have “fabricated a
story of people who were perceived
to be eliminated, apparently also by
government.”

Itis a fact that Mr Phil ya Nangoloh
and other NSHR haman rights
defenders received death threats on
several occasions. This makes it
difficult for them to carry out their
activities which is what Swapo
wants. However the NSHR and Mr
ya Nangoloh must be praised and
not condemmed and threatened for
their courage to have shed light on

- such incredible and cowardly

attempts to undermine the defence
of human rights and democracy in
this country. By publicising the
names of persons likely to be
assassinated the NSHR most
probably has saved the lives of more
Namibians who might be facing
assassinations. In so doing, the
NSHR also strongly defended the
principles of democracy and good
governance and respect for the rule
of law in this country as enshrined in
our Namibian constitution.
Fourthly, Swapo goes on with its
accusations against Ya Nangolohby
denying that there was or there is no
“cross border” trade with Angola on
the part of the NDF. However, there
is strong evidence that the NDF made
use of State vehicles and NDF
soldiers to casry out such border
trade in building materials apparently
for the enrichment of certain
individuals. The NDF themselves
have never denied the NSHR report.

Fifthly, Swapo further claims that
if Ya Nangoloh “do(es) not want to
live under Swapo government, he
should just pack and go instead of
indulging himself in dangerous
subversive activities.” This
misleading statement must be
styongly rejected and condemned
with the contempt it deserves. Ya
Nangoloh and the NSHR have both
the right and duty to accurately
informed the Namibian and other
peace loving peoples about human
fights violations by whoever and
whenever such violations occur.

Human rights and democracy are
foreign to Swapo and Namibia Today
and this is why the NSHR activities
are called “dangerous subversive
activities.”

It is also not understandable how
the NSHR and Ya Nangoloh are
indulging in any “dangerous
subversive activities” by defending
human rights principles and

corruption which is so
rampant in this country. To me such
activities are duties ofeach andevery
responsible Namibian citizen.

Furthermore, it is imperative to
note that the dangerous threats
Swapo_ has made urging Ya
Nangoloh to “just (to) pack and go”
are aclear indication that the list that
the NSHR recently produced after
polting the opinion of several citizens
is far away from being misleading.
Other people can now see for
themselves from the Swapo
intimidation as published in Namibia
Today. lask myself what willhappen
to Mr ya Nangoloh if he does not
“pack and go” as suggested by
Swapo, especially after being |:
accused of “indulging himself in
dangerous subversive activities.”
Will he not be assassinated like
Shevanyenga?

Swapo must know that they and
their government will be held fully
responsible for anything happening
to Ya Nangoloh and other human
tights defenders in this country

needs promotion

I AM writing to you after spending almost a month in
your very beautiful country (over Christmas 2003 and
into January 2004).

I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to visit
both the south and north of the country as well as some
of the coast with an excellent guide and a small group
of other foreigners from various countries.

I also spent almost a week in Windhoek at the end
of my stay and visited the Katutura Victory Women’s
Movement. I got to know the very capable director,
Katrina Garises, and her colleagues there and the
choir sang for a friend from New Zealand and myself
— we were both very impressed by their performance.

Incidentally, I also met a reporter from your paper
the second time I was there.

I sing in a church choir here in the north of Italy and
also with a small jazz band which generally makes ten
or twelve public appearances a year.

I sincerely feel that the Victory Choir should have
more opportunity to appear in public, both to let
people see how good they are and also as a way of
getting funds for their very important project.

I would suggest that they could sing at the airport to
welcome international delegates arriving for meet-
ings and congresses and at the larger hotels, like the
Kalahari Sands, the Safari Court and the Country
Club Resort and Casino, where I feel sure that foreign
visitors would enjoy their performance.

I know the choir would have transport problems to
get to the hotels, but I imagine that the hotels them-
selves would be able to arrange that aspect of things.

I would be most grateful if your newspaper could
print all or part of my letter and am also sending
copies of it to the above-named hotels for their
attention.

The Victory Women’s Movement deserves and
needs your help!

Before I close, let me also say that! travel extensively
as part of my job and really enjoyed my stay in Namibia
- it now holds a very special place in my heart.

I send you all my very best wishes for happiness,
good health, success and peace.

I WOULD like to express my disappointment and
dismay through your newspaper regarding the
tuling for the Caprivi 13 accused by Judge Elton
Hoff.

Judge Hoff’s ruling for the 13 demonstrated to
the nation that the judiciary in Namibia is in the
wrong hands.

If we look at this issue critically, the judgement
was well orchestrated to be interpreted as if the
Government did not follow whatever rules or
procedures should be followed. But, in fact, Judge
Hoff formulated it (thé ruling) in such a way as to
allow the state to re-arrest them, creating room for
‘reactionary institutions’ (sic.) to cry foul about
the judiciary and painting Namibia as a country
which does not respect its own laws. This is not the
case at all.

The charges remain: the accused allegedly
planned and declared war against the Government
of the Republic of Namibia. Where we supposed to
sit back with our tails between our legs, while our
hard-earned peace is being disrupted and our
country being destabilised?

We all know the results of war - the disruption of
the well-earned peace, destruction of property,
loss of life, hunger, poverty and other setbacks.
Those who wanted to secede the Caprivi had
misguided objectives, were driven by selfishness
and hunger for political power and they — if found
guilty - should rot in jail.

The security forces should be commended for
swift action and a job well done. They have sent a

clear message to would-be terrorists that Namibia
isa well-protected democratic country and whoever
tampers with her sovereignty will feel the wrath of
the Namibian law.

Whose interest does the so-called court ruling
serve?

What made the 13 accused leave the country
under the cover of night? Who invited them to the
neighbouring countries were they were hiding? If
they had a genuine cause, why didn’t they hand
themselves over to the authorities of the countries
in which they were hiding?

But were Judge Hoff and his court blind and deaf
the day when he ruled that return of the 13 to
Namibia violated some international laws and
procedures guiding extradition.

Which procedures did the !3 follow when they
allegedly carried out their attack at Katima Mulilo?
Why should we follow some procedures by bringing
misguided elements to be tried back home? Whois
he (Judge Hoff) to determine the fate and the
interest of the Namibian nation?

is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

clear assessment has been made by
Judge Hoff, which cannot easily be

How could even Botswana
consider the Namibian

extradition of Namibians that were

such a messed-up legal system?
Who, as of now, can take Namibia

The continuous postponement
and detention without trial of
Caprivian treason suspects,
stretching up to 5 years now, is
shattering - mentally, physically and
emotionally - as well as an obstacle
to nation-building.

Have we forgotten as well that
we are dealing with human life?
If this drama and mockery of

it will only breed more hate and
disunity amongst people. It is a
time bomb that is bound to bring

AS a matter of principle, I don’t
engage in sub-standard argu-
ments, but there’re exceptions,
especially when utterances of
the anti-democratic forces beg
for an appropriate response.

It’s high time, brothers and
sisters, that the misguided
elements in our society are taken
to task and their bigotry exposed.

If peace-loving Namibians
remain silent any longer, this
country will got to the monkeys
before we know it.

It seems the anti-democratic
forces are having a good time in
Namibian political life, behav-
ing like extra-terrestrial beings
and becoming more dangerous
every passing day.

They are misusing all avenues
- talk shows, discussion panels,
conferences, etc.

The sad case in point: Mr.
Paulus Kapia’s and Honourable
Petrus Ilonga’s pointed accusa-
tions of the judiciary. They,
deliberately disregard common
sense and logic.

Were they not supposed to
know better? Why, then, did

they - out of their own free will
- choose the road of demago-
guery and hostile agitation? Is
that their only “tick” to discredit
the judiciary in general, and
Judge Elton Hoff in particular?

Another sad case in point is
Mr. Jordan Atshipara's letter
(Judge Hoff’s judgement
disappoints - Namibian 9/3/
2004).

At one point he says: “The
charges remain: the accused
allegedly planned and declared
war against the Government of
the Republic of Namibia. Were
we supposed to sit back with
our tails between our legs, while
our hard-earned peace is being
disrupted and our country being
destabilised?”

And I say: You missed the
poim altogether. The case before
Judge Hoff was not one of high
treason but one of unlawful
extradition. Even if it was acase
of “alleged” high treason that
remains an “allegation” to be
tested in a competent court of
law (not a kangaroo court or
something).

He says: “We all know the
results of war ... those who want
to secede the Caprivi .... If found
guilty - should rot in jail.”

And I say: So! There is stilla
possibility of them being found
guilty - wait till thea!

He asks: “But were Judge
Hoff and his court blind and
deaf the day when he ruled that
return of the 13 to Namibia
violated some intemational laws
and procedures guiding
extradition?

Which procedures did the 13
follow when they allegedly
carried out their attack at Katima
Mulilo? Why should we follow
some procedures by bringing
misguided elements to be tried
back home?”

And I say: It seems we are
dealing with an arrogant misgui-
ded element who believes that
the State should not follow
proce-dures simply because
alleged terrorists did the same,
ah?

He asks: “Who is he (Judge
Hoff) to determine the fate and
the interest of the Namibian

nation?”

And I ask: Are you accusing
the Government of bringing
high treason suspects before an
“unknown Judge”, who has no
right “to determine the fate and
interest of the Namibian
nation”?

Come on guys; let’s be
serious!

Why not consider the real
causes for the Swapo Party

performance before Namibian
and international courts
(Kasikili!)? Like, for example,
negligent legal advisers,
incompetent State prosecutors,
reckless police investigations
and indefensible violations, by

A letter to The Namibian
- ‘Condemn the Killers’ - is an
example where the writer shows
his total ignorance about the
situation in the Middle East and
it’s people.

The writer claims that Pales-
tinians are foreigners in the Holy
Land and should be expeiled by
the Israelis in order to achieve
everlasting peace. He also writes
that Palestinians are not men-
. tioned in The Bible or recorded
by historians. In the letter he
criticised European Union gov-
emments for condemning the
assassination of Hamas leader
Yassin by Israelis.

This isn’t the place for me
to write about the 10 000-year
long history of these two great
nations which contributed so
much to world cultures in terms
of many discoveries, writings

and science. My sole objective
is to correct misperceptions on
this particular issue.

The fact is that the Arabs
and the Jews believe that they
descend from the same father
- Abraham. No-one is sure who
came first tothe Holy Land. His-
tory only tells us that Palestine
was first peopled by wandering
Stone Age hunters and that per-
manent agricultural settlement
appeared at Jericho about 8000
B.C. According to historical
claims Hebrew (Jews) tribes
arrived from the desert in Pales-
line between the 14th and 12th
century B.C.and that roughly
the same time the Philistines
invaded from the sea.

The name Palestine is in fact
anadaptation from a Greek word
“the land of Philistines” and the
name is mentioned many timesin
The Bible. First Book Gen 21:34:
“Abraham lived in Philestia for
a long time”.

Just for the record 1 would
like to mention that in 1918 the
Palestine population consisted
of 500 000 Muslim Arabs, 100
000 Arab Christians and 60 000

Jews.

At the time of the 1948 war,
more than 500 000 Palestinians
fled from their country to seek
refuge with Arab neighbours. In
every Arab country where they
landed, they were treated as
second-class citizens, confined
to ghettos specially created for
them

Why EU governments con-
demn the killing of Hamas
leader Mr Yassinis because they
believe that the assassination of
political leaders promotes more
violence and does not provide
a solution for either sides. Not
long ago, Swapo was just like
Hamas, on American terrorist
lists, and everybody wouldagree
with me that assassination of its
President, Sam Nujoma, by the
former South African white re-
gime, would only have destroyed
the relationship between blacks
and whites and caused more ha-
tred; but would ultimately never
have prevented Namibia from
becoming Independent.

KINDLY allow me space
in your highly esteemed
newspaper to comment on
the opinion piece of Phil ya
Nangoloh which appeared
in the Namibian of April 16,
2004. fam of the opinion that
statements of that nature and
in that fashion should not be
left unchallenged by patriotic
citizens.

Prophets of Doom have
always been there since time
memorial, but the opinion
piece in question does not
only predict a bleak future
for the country but also mis-
lead the readers with regard
to the calibre of President
Sam Nujoma and that of the
Swapo Party of Namibia
lest we forget why Swapo
emerged.

Such statements should be
rejected with the contempt
it deserves by all patriotic
citizens and the international!
friends of Namibia.

The opinion piece created
an impression that our in-
cumbent President is power
hungry, and also misrepre-
sents the facts relating to the
so-called infighting among
the Swapo Party rank and file
with regard to succession and
a lack of democracy in the
structures of the party.

Every movement or or-
ganisation has its power

dynamics and Swapo Party
should not be singled out for
criticism. The recent breaka-
way factions of the Official
Opposition are testimony
that power dynamics exist
in all organisations.

1 would like to state that,
people of Ya Nangoloh’s
calibre should know better
about the political dynamics
in this country and should
lead the illiterate masses to
the truth and not make use
of public platforms and their
knowledge to mislead the
youth and future generations
of tomorrow. Itis unfortunate
to note that right from the be-
ginning when he emerged as
the Director of the National
Society for Human Rights, he
has opposed the Swapo Party
of Namibta, its government
and specifically its President
and poticies.

When one reads between
the lines of what he said
with regard to the Swapo
Party Central Committee
decision to nominate three
candidates for President, not
only of the Swapo Party but
also of the country after Dr.
Sam Nujoma, one gets the
impression that Swapo does
not have democracy and that
all decisions are dictatorially
taken by President Nujoma.

Thisisaclear misrepresen-

tation of what Swapo is all
about and is intended to sow
seeds of doubt and mistrust
in the people but also for
the much needed investors
intending to invest in the
country. One just wonders
who really pulls the strings
of Mr. Ya Nangoloh?

Democracy was brought
in Namibia by Swapo and
its leader President Sam
Nujoma. It has been proven
beyond reasonable doubt at
the formation of the Swapo
Party and recently by the
Swapo Party Central Com-
Mittee meeting of April 2
2004 that the interest of the
nation is far more important
than that of an individual.

I hereby submit that is
has also been proven by
the founding father of the
nation and first President of
the independent Republic of
Namibia io his tast State of
the Nation’s Address that he
will leave office by March 21
2005. with confidence that
the new head of state will
build on the foundation that
we have built collectively.
Let us give praise to a great
leader comrade!

Ya Nangoloh also cites the
State House project to justify
his claims, forgetting that the
project is for the nation and
not for an individual, and as

it was eartier said, “the State
House project should repre-
sent the nation's pride (Not

am confident that if] goto the
graves of Mr. Ya Nangoloh’s
parents, I will be able to find
atombstone. Why should all
citizens and a free nation not
have something to relate to,
to be proud of and to identify
themselves with?

T would like to focus on Ya
Nangoloh’s opinion piece in
particular but not limit my-
self to mention that in general
people are out there to mis-
lead the nation. InSwapo we
have learnt to tolerate this,
but I am of the opinion that
they should be opposed and
excluded by all peace loving
and progressive citizens, by
all means possible!

Mr. Ya Nangoloh, the Pres-
ident is not so narcissistic to
fire the cadres that he has

led as you think and suggest
in your opinion piece. The
President will not dissolve
the Parliament to cling to
power, the President is not
Robert Mugabe and for that
matter Namibia is certainly
Not going to take the Zim-
babwe route to resolve the
land issue.

A government should
make decisions that are in
the interest of the nation and
agovernment is mandated by
the electorate to make deci-
sions on their behalf. The
decision to expropriate land
is in the national interest and
inline with the constitutional
provisions. As bona fida
members of the Party, we
expect our leaders to take
action and implement the
Swapo Party Manifestoof the
last elections. Please do not
try to score cheap political
points in this regard.

I would like to thank the
President of the Republic of
Namibia on behalf of those
who argue like me for the
generous contribution he has
made to the future of the Land
of the Brave. Your dedicated
service during the struggle
and after independence will
never be forgotten. Your wise
philosophical saying that,
“a victim never forgets, but
the doer does” is true in the

circumstances.

Those who criticise the
people’s movement Swapo,
and its founding leader today
was part and parcel of the
system that caused a lot of
inequities in all social struc-
tures of the black people.

Mr. Ya Nangoloh’s opin-
ion piece and those that are
similar in content are not
welcome in Namibia, par-

‘ticularly at a time that the

people are nominating their
next leader. Remember, we
shall forgive but never forget
what happened in Namibia
prior to independence and
especially those who have
sacrificed their lives for this
nation. Today we are a free
people with only one aim; to
restore our dignity and claim
back what was stolen and
what belongs to us.

I would like to conclude
by quoting his Excellency in
his last State of the Nation's
address, “A united people
striving to achieve a com-
mon goal for all members
of the society, wit! always
remain victorious”. Let
these philosophical words
of wisdom be the building
blocks of our future endeav-
ours comrades.

1AM not new to the liberation strug-
gles of southem Africa. In fact I was
bom into the struggle waged by the
ANC in South Africa and married
into the struggle waged by Swapo
in Namibia. Now, when you are bom
into something, it is part of you and
you are part of it, not by choice but
by birth. The liberation struggle was
about peopte, land and wealth. It was
about the inalienable right of people to
freedom. It was about reclaiming our
dignity as Africans and indigenous
inhabitants of the soi! of Africa. In
fact the liberation struggle bas been
about claiming the right to deciding
our own destiny as nations of Africa or
at tholoast, having some inputin such
decisions. lt was also about everyday
“bread and butter” issues.

Tam sure that anthropological ox-
perts will testify to the fact that one
of the outstanding charactenstics of
populations is that they are not stag-
nant, but are constantly undergoing
dynamic transformation. The aim is
to ensure that this mobility is upward
and forward instead of regressing.

For the masses the struggle has
been about basic human rights. The
right to protection, the right to food.
clothing, shelter, education, health
care and the nght to free association.
Whilst each one has to take respon-
sibility for their own actions and
life, it is the collective that has to
ensure that the correct ere
and environmental milieu as well as
systems and structures are in place
to guarantees a positive contribution
by the individual for the betterment
of the society. Internationally it is
the Breton Woods Institutions that
countries adhere to and support for
the sake of having workable and
organised societics.

This immediately calls on the
individual who has the right to be
ambitious to exercise Tansparency
and accountability. Hence the adop-
tion of a system called democracy.
The adoption of democracy does
not imply the adoption of a western
system, but is rather the implementa-
tion of the best workable system that

contains an assemblance of fairness
and exudes a sense of ational pride
and a sense of worthiness and dignity
to the socicty it serves. Democracy
can be customised to suit that par-
ticular nation’s needs.

The world has become a global
village mainly dus to the strides man
has made in information technology
as woil as the affordability and speed
with which people are able to travel
from continent to continent. In my
own travels | find that people have
a keen interest in socio-economic
and political matters on the African
continent and the world at large.

What | have observed is that the
populace of Africa is no longer pre-
pared to accept any sense of embar-
ressment because of corrupt political
teaders in their respective countries.
This goes for the people's intolerance
towards despouc tendencies from
whatever quarter.

I have montioned the masses and
their interest when it came to the
liberation struggles. However, it must
not be forgotten that it has been the
same masses that produced a robust
and solid revolutionary intelligentsta
able to interpret and practice real
politics.

Having come from the masses doca
not necessarily assume thal those
with power will not be corrupted by
hunger for such power. Nevertheless,
these appetites are kept in check
by the fact that there are others to
compete with as well as ihe voice
of the masses to contend with. The
reault is that the best persoo will then
win. Owing to the ever- changing
dynamics of society, leaderahip will
also change because at the end of the
day, leadership is about the people,
the collective, the nation and not the
indivicual.

The aim and art of both politics
and religion is to unify people and to
ensure the sustainability of that unity
through service dell very. In any capi-
taliet society, “service delivery” Is a
popular buzzword because the society
isenticod, tempted and encouraged to
consume. Financial interactions are

tainly cheracterised by producers
and consumers and members of the
population interchanging these roles.
The danger bere |s that the majority of
the population will become consum-
ers instead of contributors.

Many times this leads toa situation
where a minority of the population
become very wealthy with the rich
getting richer and the poor getting
poorer. The electronic media play
a rigorous role in encouraging this
state of affairs even through their
soep operas whose emphasis is on
wealth and immoral living. ©

The bottom line is that in order for
anation to actively engage in matters
that affect it’s existence, tho elected
political and charch leaders together
with the bureaucrats and technocrats
in both the public and private sector
have to present the nation with io-
novative cutting edge programs that
include all af society.

The last ime I counted, there were
forty-two countries holding elections
during the year of 2004 globally. This
means that there is a changing of the
guard taking piace in many countries
including Namibia. Friend and enenry
have toadmit that Namibia has main-
tained a powerful sense of political,
civil and economic stability, which
together have contri buted to the peace
and tranquillity of the country. The
Swapo leadership has proven their
tenacity and political maturity ovor
aod over agaln when issues, which
could have got out of hand, wore
handled with great craftiness and
smartness as well. That is why it
thould not come as a surprise to thoss
who undorstand the agenda of Swapo
that the president has announced his
decision to bring his teaure as head
of stato to a respectable, dignified
closure as would be oxpected of any
great African leader of our dmo. We
can aleo rest assured thal bo longer
boing the president of the Republic
does not sntomatically mean that it
is the end of our president's politi-
cal carcer.

In fact for me it is the continua-
tion of a powerful career, which is

pow to take another form. That of
African Stateaman, especially with
the intoresting evolution of the Af-
rican Union and programs such as
Nopad. [t is statesmen such as our
president and ex-president Nelson
Mandela together with others of their
generation and calibre that make us,
the younger generation proud of be-
ing African.

tremain convinced that Swapo like
other mass based politica! parties in
the sub-region definitely has the in-
terests of the nation and the country
at heart. | watch with amazement
how some of the media mies the

when the main issues go beyond the
individual. The thing is that no mat-
ter how much the prophets af doom
ecream and shout, the people are ot
prepared to trust anyone with their
lives and their children’s future, but
rather those men and women who
unselfishly led the liberation struggic.
Let us face it.

Service delivery for the masses and
the previously disadvantaged under a
Swapo government has taken place
‘and even reshaped the landscape of
the country. [1 is a grew achievo-
ment for a community thal never
had running water coming out of
taps to havo this supptied to it. This
includes etectricity and roads as well
ts telephone lines.

The above have been the main
aspects of life that the community
has cried out for. The minority are
concemed with tax breaks, micro and
macto economic strategies and gov-
ommeont spending which is fine, but
many times the motive behind these
concerns is usually self-ceotred. Our
naticn lain the proves of:
afuture gooeration where wealth
no longer be the right of only ane
colour, but our children, black and
white will be ontiied to achieve and
possces weaith as Nerniblans.

It ig an achievement when people
who could never have expocted
anything in the past can own a ploce
of ground to build a house. ft is an

achievement when al} our children
are free to attend any school and play
anywhere and do not have to be sub-
jected to carly morning raids in which
their parents are snatched from them.
Itis an achievement whea the entire
tation does not have to be gripped
by a demonic spirit of fear because
of draconian td Laws.

Asa son of the liberation strug-
sie and a citizen of Namibia as my
adopted country and as a minister of
the gospel of Jesus Christ and an ex-
UN diplomat, | would like to inform
the sogmen of our society which bas
never experienced the real brunt of

mibia. | sense an uncomfortable anxi-
ety among some of my indigenous

ELECTIONS would be fair if those who vote elected
their representatives freely without any pressure or
any form of intimidation or character assassination?
I strongly feel that (the Swapo Congress) elections
were not free and fair.

The sacking of our visionary, capable Hamutenya
just before elections and smear campaigns against
him by Nujoma on several occasions will never
make this election free and fair.

I would not expect any rational person to believe
what has been said about Hamutenya by those who
did so, including the President.

We expected the President to tell the nation and
the Congress in particular that these are tested
comrades and the everybody should make his/her
own choice accordingly.

He is now claiming that the Congress has voted
in the interest of the whole nation. This is totally
wrong. The congress has voted for Nujoma’s un-
known interests.

If the entire nation was afforded a chance to
elect, I think the results could have been different.
The fact that Pohamba came with a pre-prepared
speech for the victory shows us that the results
were predetermined and the transparency used in
the counting processes is questionable.

We considered Sam Nujomaas the great founding
father of our nation and indeed a visionary leader

of Africa but this was not so. _Nujoma is increas-
ingly becoming a hardcore despot. He thinks he can
turn things around, ceteris paribus. Firing senior
ministers and indeed cabinet members who served
for decades is a big embarrassment to him and to
the public.

Does this mean Swapo party does not have inter-
nal disciplinary procedures to deal with unfounded
defaming allegations? He keeps on referring to

others as imperialists and forgets that he went to

the same imperialists to negotiate for Namibia’s
independence.

His prerogative is being seriously misused. Some
ministers are so much preferred that firing them
would destabilise the country’s peace and stability
and dissolve the gains of our hard-won independ-

ence. This is also a sign that Swapo is slowly but

surely disintegrating.

I think this was the wrong decision at the wrong
time. All the peace loving Namibians (perhaps ex-
cluding despots, opportunists, presidential remote
controls, political armatures, and power-hungry
hereby sympathise with Hamutenya and his deputy.
We are already missing his intellectual leadership
which we always admired.

KINDLY allow me space in your
newspaper to air my views on what
] see as an issue which should
concern all true patriots as well
as taxpayers in this country, the
purchase of the Boeing 747 Combi
by Air Namibia.

First let me thank the government
of the Republic for its commitment
todevelopment.I cannot enumerate
all its achievements because there
are so many. Let me also say that I
have no doubt that the government
wishes to see things moving in this
country, after all that is what we
fought for. To return to the Jumbo

Jet, I think, keeping quiet on this
issue would be tantamount tosaying
Icould not care less about the future
of this country. As a citizen, I feel it
is my duty not to allow what I see
as imprudent financial decisions to
continue to be made.

When one looks at the financial
quagmire into which the Combi
has dragged Air Namibia, they
would not think that it was the same
plane that brought the ‘feel- good
factor’ in some quarters upon its
purchase. I trusted that those who
make decisions onour behalf would
be careful not to pour public money

down the drain by engaging in what
seems to bea not-well-thought
through purchase.

The reasons advanced for the
lack of viability of the Boeing
makes one wonder whether proper
procedures that purchases of that
magnitude require, had been fol-
lowed prior to the purchase. In my
book, there seems to be indications
of lack of sound economic think-
ing in the purchase of the Combi.
Consequently, to put my mind at
peace regarding the purchase of
the Boeing, Air Namibia should
answer the following questions:

Was any investigation conducted
to determine the viability of the
Boeing? If it was, why are we now
being told that the Combi's carry-
ing Capacity and its maintenance
make ita financial burden? Did not
the study address these and other
pertinent issues?

Comrades, let us admit that the
purchase of the Boeing 747 was a
squandering of government money,
money which could have been put
to use somewhere else. In my
view, this kind of practice will in
the long run undermine the govern-
ment and therefore to deter this

kind of spending of public funds
in future, somebody must be made
accountable for this shameful
blunder.

If you want me to believe other-
wise, convince me that the decision
to purchase the plane in question
was based on scientific investi ga-
tions the results of which were
positive. And therefore the current
financial crisis is not a result of poor
planning. The question is: Have we
learnt any lessons?

DESPITE all the allegations and lessons learnt from
the past about the incumbent President, none holds
water until proven right, but it is acceptable for
people to speculatively express themselves.

Many people believe that Pohamba will keep the
status quo but experience just outside the border
(Zambia-Mwanawasa) teaches us otherwise. 1 don’t
take charismatic theorists for granted, but I believe in

collective leadership. So long as Pohamba is listen-

ing to intellectual advice and to the general public,
he will definitely deliver beyond expectation.

The party’s presidential elections are over and
there is nothing one can do to reverse the situation
and those who seemed the most preferred for the
position hold relatively less support within their
political abodes.

So, what else can a rational peace lover do? In

PROMPTED by the publication of ...
“instances of hate speech” by the National
Society of Human Rights in our media
allow me to pass some comments, and
express my personal opinion on this very
serious issue.

I don’t think it would be necessary to
write or explain more about the grave
consequences of hate speech. It's all
well known and documented in places
like Bosnia (the country of my birth) and
Rwanda.

I have to mention that for many years I
used to live under two, which I would call
“evil systems”, being communism and
apartheid respectively.

However evil the two were, none of the
two allowed hate speech to be directed
towards other nationalities or races. Under

the communists, hate speech even heavily
punishable by the law.

Here in Namibia where the building of ;
“one Namibia one Nation” and reconcili-
ation should be the priorities for the sake
of peace and stability.

We have destructive elements among
the democratically elected public figures,
like some government officials and union
leaders, who are by their speeches finding
it very difficult to connect their mouths
with their brains.

What makes matters even worse, their
speeches are broadcasted, over and over,
in most of our spoken languages.

Even winning by 99% of votes, no
government can claim for itself to be
transparent and democratic if it allows
the rights of minorities to be disrespected

and violated.

However, NBC and other instigators of
racial hatred in our society didn't achieve
anything so far and hopefully this will be
so in the future. I, as a white Namibian,
can still walk freely in any of the “black
residential areas” without fear of racial
motivated attacks.

-If Namibian fallen heroes, who died for
a multiracial society and justice in this
country, could now hear what comes out of
the mouths of Kapenda and Kapia, believe
me, they would turn in their graves.

My sincere congratulation goes to all
peace loving Namibians on their shown
maturity and tolerance.

IAM writing in response to the
letter by Mr Alexactus T. Kaure
(How Namibia Supports Israel's
Palestine Occupation).

Mr Kaure has used the words
“blood diamonds” and “Methods
of Suppression”.

He can make good use of the
term “blood for oil” since most
world leaders are

so guick appease OIL RICH
Arab nations by condemning
any form of self defence by the
Israeli’s.

The same UN was very quick
to support the war in Afghanistan
after only one dreadful day of ter-
ror attacks on American soil.

The I{sraeli’s have tived with
people who send children with
suicide belts onto Jewish lands
for so many years, that people
like Mr. Kaure, like many others
may have become used to Jews
being killed.

Very few people notice the fact
that the Israeli’s have tried to
make peace with the “Palestin-
ians” even though the “Palestin-
ian” organisations all have one
thing in common: The objective
of The Destruction of the State
of Israel.

The Israelis’ have even called
these Arab migrants “Palestin-
ians”, knowing that there is no
such nation as “Palestinians”.
Any person (Christian, Muslim or
Jew !) who wishes to contradict
me on this can open his Bible
or Hadith and look for the word
Palestinian.

The closest word to this is the
Philistines, whom the Lord has
driven from His land to give to
the Jews.

I see that Mr. Kaure mentions
that Mr. Leviev is a “sponsor” of
Israel and “Jewish activities”.

So I guess that Mr. Kaure
does not like Jews or their tiny
State. It is difficult to understand
why people, some who claim to
be Christians, don’t like Jews
since the Messiah has a Jewish
mother, and his first Apostles
were Jews.

The Muslims’ Hadith give
a good idea of what the Arabs
(Umaral Khatibin particular) did
to the Jews and how some of the
Arabs aka ‘Palestinians’ came to
live in Israel.

The Jast two weeks has shown
just how far the EU and UN will
take their

double standards with the prob-
lem of terrorism.

These leaders are quick to con-
demn Israel for retaliating when
they are attacked by “Palestinian”
mititants.

The tsraeli’s then choose to
build a wall to keep the suicide
bombers out.

Then the oi! rich Arab world
is unhappy because the wall ts
very effective in it’s purpose of
protecting Jews, Christians and
other non Muslim “infidels”.

Therefore they took to the UN
and EU, convinces them that the
“Palestinian” suffering weighs
heavier than Israeli lives.

The biased UN then condemns
Israel for building the security bar-
tier. In this case the Israeli’s can-
not win no matter what they do.
From my Zionist Christian point
of view, the Israeli’s should first
seek their own security only then
the approval of Mr. Kaure, the
international courts, the UN the
EU and all others who approve
of oi] rich Arab nations who are
OK with killing of Jews.

I HOPE this time my letter will ap-
pear, unlike the other two or three
cases when you (unintentionally)
omitted them. I will copy it to the
other media, just in case.

I read the rather confusing, if
not uninformed, opinion of Nadia
Ihuhua, where she was dissatis-
fied with Uutoni Nujoma’s pres-
entation to the CHR in Geneva,
regarding the case of the Caprivi
secessionists.

Well, Nadia, like any other
Namibian, you have a right to air
your opinion as you did, so let me
do the same as follows:

How informed are you if you
label Cde. Paulus Kapia as one
of the “government officials”?
When last we checked Cde. Ka-
pia was a Party official. Nadia
rightly alluded to the need for us
to have “responsible and trans-
parent leaders who know what
is important and what constitutes

human-centred

development” She is right but
which humans are being referred
to? To me, only leaders tothe con-
trary willallow sucha vision to be
derailed by a few elements

such as Muyongo and his
cohorts.

After all when we talk of hu-
man-centered development don’t
we mean the people with a sense
of purpose, that of sustainable de-
velopment, like the ones we have?
Or, Do we mean the detractors, Ms
Ihuhua? Surely we do not mean
to spend all the scant resources
on the rights of the detractors
rather than on the pensions of our
elderly or HIV-AIDs patients?
Do you really think if we spend
millions of $ this case, we will
elevate our human rights record
internationally?

What about the right to live in
peace, the right to food, the right

live without fear etc? What kind
of agenda do you want to set for
us, innocent citizens?

Then again, since you are invit-
ing people to go to the launching
of the NSHR Report, then I guess
I (and everyone else) know where
you are coming from. Good luck
with that event, but for the rest of
us, we prefer democracy, which
is the government by the people
(majority) for the people, and of
the people.

If you really have the future of
our country at heart, please stop
being phony and be a Namibian.
The few people you are talking
about want their own country.

They will have their fair chance
under our laws. The question is,
are they with Republicof Namibia
or with their dream Republic?

IAM anexperienced worldwide traveller
and visited Namibia for the fourth time
this July together with my husband and
two children. My conclusion is simple
Namibia isa gem....comparedeven with
South Africa - let me tell you why:

Upon arrival at the airport we meet
friendly immigration officials who
made us feel really welcome in Namibia
- rather then looking nasty as is the case
in many countries.

The small but cosy airport immedi-
ately gives a feeling of being at home.
Government officials, immigration
staff and customs alike all are very
professional and friendly. 1 believe
these people should know this and be
encouraged to keep it that way!! To-
gether with our two children we found
travelling extremely easy and secure. All
the way I experienced proper Telecom
infrastructure, roads and nice people.
There are many criticisms of the
staff of Etosha...sorry I didn’t find those
unfriendly people.

So Namibians be proud you have a
gem in your hands and make sure you
keep it and develop it with a smile.

Another example of where the public
administration does well is the Windhoek
general post office; the staff was most
helpful and friendly to help me with our
son's stamp collection.

Why I did write to your newspaper as
you probably know all this? First there
ismy concem that you are not aware that
you are doing well.

Cniics like to cite recent articles like

those published in Der Spiegel to warn
everyone that the country Is in trouble...
Second there is a warning: I am scared
that Namibia changes its lovely attitude
and becomes involved in issues like
those in Zimbabwe.

This would kill the atmosphere and
tourism with it. You need to ensure con-
tinued safety: There is nothing you want
more on holiday than peace of mind.

lalways felt safe compared to Belgium
(whichis NOT the case in RSAand NOT
at all in Zimbabwe).

That feeling of safety is a result of
how people react in Windhoek up to the
remotest corners of Damaraland.

Something additional to mention is
medical back up and police safety; you
have a medical evacuation system like
international SOS .

Make sure these people are well
known and can do their work atall times.
For tourists knowing that there is such
support in case the worst happens is a
must...to be a designated destination in
the world.

It doesn’t stop with being evacuated
quickly you also need good medical fa-
cilities. I visited Mediclinicin Windhoek
and was impressed by the facilities and
proper care. If | was the government |
would ensure that private initiatives such
as Mediclinic and SOS get all support
to be able to flourish andoffer medical
back Jup in case.

PLEASE allow me a
space in your newspaper
to air my concern over
Otjiwarongo Cheetah
Festival which was or-
ganised in June by the
Otjiwarongo Tourism
Forum.

Initially it was a con-
cept to attract potential
investors to Otjiwarongo
and expose the opportu-
nities we can offer.

Howeverthetnd result
of the so called Cheetah
Festival was just another
form of apartheid and
racism which was or-
chestrated to only benefit
the minority (whites) on
the expense of the black
masses.

My rationale for call-
ing it this is based on
the fact that the black
participating cultural
groups received a dif-
ferent, discriminating,
inhuman and insulting
treatment. The occasion
was organised so stra-
tegically that the black
groups were performing
at a separate location
at the ‘white elephant’
museum rather than at

the main venue (open
space next to the town
Municipality) where
the white groups were
performing. The main
venue was where most
of the activities and peo-
ple were concentrated.
This was indeed a local
investment centre for the
festival.

Black groups on other
side were not even at-
tended by the organisers
and worst of all, no-one,
apart from the participat-
ing groups themselves
turned upat the socalled
museum. How did the
black community ben-
efit from the so-called
festival apart from be-
ing used to eyeblind
the local politicians and
waste their time and
energies? The level of
community involvement

the festival was indeed

to perform at the main
venue, but when they

THE other day while looking
through a row of shirts on sale in
a shop in the centre of town,

I heard a young female shop
assistant, obviously feeling very
. uncomfortable, saying: “Just leave
me in peace”.

A man, also an employee of the
shop and probably her superior,
was following her around say-
ing:

“But you need to have fouror five
partners and you should be friendly
and nice with all of them.”

Obviously harassed, the young
woman walked off, the man still
talking in the same vein, trailing

along behind her.

Women need to realise that this
sort of behaviour is sexual harass-
ment and that they need not put up
with this kind of treatment from
colleagues or superiors.

They should report these men
immediately to their supervisors.

Men should realise that this kind
of behaviour is extremely uncom-
fortable and repressive for women.
When making any kind of compli-
ment they should pay attention to
the effect their words have on the
woman and stop when they see that
she is feeling uncomfortable.

In this ime of the HIV-pandemic

it is a serious threat to anybody's
health and life to have more than
one partner.

Also sexual harassment of this
kind may make life so uncom-
fortable for the woman involved
that she may quit her job. thus
contributing to unemployment,
poverty and in many cases to the
suffering of children.

Of course, sexual harassment
may also be perpetrated by women
upon men with equally negative
consequences.
