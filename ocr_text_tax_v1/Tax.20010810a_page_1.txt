Put It In The Past

I WOULD like to ratse a
question about this com-
pensauion business men-
tioned on the front page of
your newspaper today
(16.8.01 ). If any govern-
ment pays compensauon,
it will come from taxpay-
ers who were bom 100
years after the abolition of
slavery. It must be remem
bered that the majority of
black Africans sold into
slavery were Cap and
sold by their fellow black
Africans, probably from
other more dominanttnibes.

The Romans took other
Europeans and Africans
‘ntoslavery. Soin fact did
Ghengis Khan and his
Mongol Hods. The Popes
of the pastand their hench-
men were responsible for
the many deaths. Hitler
killed Jews on a grand
scale. The people from
whom compensation
could rightfully be
claimed are dead. Those
from whom compensation
will now be paid had ab-
colutely nothing todo with
it. I feel that sad as it is
that these human rights
abuses happened, they are
in the past and deserve to

be left there.
