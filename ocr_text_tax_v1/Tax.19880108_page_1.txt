Arandis unhappy

1S Arandisa proclaimed area or 18 Ita
city or atown? Since, according to Ross-
ing, Arandis belongs to the Damara
authority as far as buying houses 18
concerned, but when it comes W
dismissal of employees, Arandis Is a
mine town. Years back we were
assaulted, molested and arrested by
the South African Railway Police at
Arandis railway station where we had
to pay hundreds of Rands in fines.

A similar type of problem 18
manifesting itself in Arandis again.
We are overwhelmed by traffic police
inan area where there are no traffic of:
fices, no registration authonty offices.

The streets in Arandis are too nar:
row (for parking purposes) and only
one-way streets! Arandis falls under
Swakopmund (eg. registration
number) and we think that the
behaviour of these traffic police follows
on a Rossing management brief that
alleged accident figures are high in
Arandis. No serious accidents ever
take place there. The behaviour of the
traffic police who seem to be after tax-
payer's money before the 25th of each
month, seems to be aimed at colour.
Why do similar incidents not take
place in Vineta or Tamariskia?

We request RÃ©ssing management a8
we}l asthe Damara authorities to look
into this situation before any
unpleasantness takes place.
