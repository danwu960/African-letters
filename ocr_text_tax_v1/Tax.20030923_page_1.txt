Leading From The Front~

MUCH noise has been made about the fourth
term. Everyone with ears who dares to care has
heard the President saying the constitution does
not allow him to stand again. He has said he
would retire at the end of his current term. So that
is not the debate we should be having, instead we
should focus on who will take the mantle further.
For a stast, the Prime Minister should have
moved one step up. But given the fact he has
reduced the weight of the office of the Prime
Minister to only opening anything that needs to |
be opened (public relations events) inthe hope of |
being seen in areas where he has never been seen |
before, and the fact that his wife's business |
interests (one JWG Advertising) does not pay -
tax to the Government as required by law, his
leadership 1s in serous doubt. That leaves only two
other leaders - the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the
Minister of Lands who can Perform better [tis time
they are given the chance ty lead from the front
