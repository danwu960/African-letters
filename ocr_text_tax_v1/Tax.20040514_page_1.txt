Can The PM Explainâ€™?

] AM sixteen years old in grade 10 but Iam
very interested in politics as my wish is to
become a politician.

I know that when I go to Edumeds to buy
my text books there is always VAT on the
price which means I am also paying tax to
the government in order to enable the gov-
ernment to help develop this country or to
help citizens like the people of Caprivi that
are in emergency Situation.

But I am shocked to hear that the Prime
Minister uses Our tax money to go and
campaign for his party at the expense of all
other Namibians. He went to see the Caprivi
victims but at the same time told them to vote
for Swapo. These poor people came to hear
what the government is going to do about
their situation but he took advantage of this
opportunity to campaign for his party.

I] have read this in The Namibian of April 27,
2004 in the statement of NSHR

but I am not sure if this is correct, can Prime
Minister Gurirab confirm or deny these
allegations because to me this is a corrupt
practice.

Can he please publicly confirm or deny.
