Preserving the
Status quo

THERE CAN BE no pretense. There
can be no cover up. Moses Kat
jluongualsacollaborator Heas net
only a member of the MIPC
machinery set up by the South
Afnean Government, the most ar-
ticulate member of a ( abinet Pro.
tected by the South African army and
IS Secret services, buthe also prevents
people from peacefully registering
their resection of South Aftican col,
omalhism and oppresuen.

AU a recent press conterence be
said ‘to give peopic treedom is notte
give them heenee to turn against the
State. These fateful words ts dN pie
proot, not only of the extent and
depth of his collaboration, but the
fact that he is no nationalist but a
mere feachionary.

However devious his rhetoric, his
capability to ‘capture the imagina-
tion of the majority of the popula-
tion’ has been reduced to vero rf it
ever existed at all. For to bea fnend

of the stateisto bea triend of tvran-
ny, brutahity, violence, Oppression
and symilar vices.

The fact that the South Afnean
rule in this country 1s illegal, her in-
struments, the Admpnistrator
General, armed forces and national
assembly must also be without
legitimacy

Nonetheless, Mr Katyiuongua sees
It fil to State that ‘we must be seen to
be doing the work we said we would
do for the people of this country, and
we must jusufy taxpavers money. He
even finds 1t necessary to attempt the
propaganda that ‘the transitional
government has committed itself to
changing the country to makett bet-
ter for its people’

The laws that Moses Kaljiuongua
holds are the laws that virtually the
whole Namibian population has
dismissed as oppressive and immoral
and have fought since the orjgin of
our political struggle and earlier

Surely poltical stability means
preservation of the status quo. Any
change brought about by the Cabinet
will be of the type that fits wath the
grand designs and strategies of South
Africa to retain control of our land
and its resources.

Katjiuongua deprives peace:
loving men and women to make their
grievances heard in a peaceful way
-nd asks these people to surrender
(heir genuine aspirations for 1ustice,
neace and freedom im favour of
docile acceptance ol laws which are
an abathema to them wileres! ial
wellbemns.

In case the lighl. cducated
Cabinet member docs not knows it,
peacefulcampangns and CIN ES UIELPO St
are not the same thing.
