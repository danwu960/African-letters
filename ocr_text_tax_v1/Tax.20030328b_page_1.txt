On Acquired Expatriate
Dependency Syndrome

THE letter of M Makumbi
that appeared in your es-
teemed newspaper of March
18th, 2003 should not go
without comment.
lam an expatriate who
has been in this country for
the past three years, and
sometimes | get very frus-
trated at the countryâ€™s fail-
ure to invest in human capi-
talin fields that matter most.
This has been the cause of
the so-called Acquired Ex-
Patriate Dependency Syn-
drome(AEDS), described by
Makumbi. There seems to
be a total ignorance even of
what kind Of scientists, tech-
nologists and engineers this
country needs. As a result,
more money is being in-
vested in the training of spe-
Ctalists who end UP roaming
the streets looking for jobs,
instead of focusing on train-
ing job creators.

One fact though, is that
Namibians themselves are
not committed to Serving in
Ow paying Professions,
which albeit, require many

years of training and hard
work. The University of Na-
mibia,can for example, hardly
retain a Namibian witha post-
graduate qualification in eco-
nomics, engineering or IT.
They leave the University for
better paying jobs outside the
University, in the Govern-
mentand private sector. Simi-
larly, most Namibian medical
Practitioners find that Private
Practice is better paying than
working in a Government hos-
pital.

That is why Namibia must
be very thankful for countries
like Cuba which continue (o
send their doctors to work
here, and for those other ex-
Patriates, who leave their
countries to work here. As a
Matter of fact, Namibia is not
the most attractive place for
expatriates to work. Salarics
are generally low, taxation is
very high, and even despite
paying all taxes, expatriates
have no easy access to state
benefits such as basic educa-
tion and medical care. Nota-
bly, many of them are leaving

Namibls for their home coun-
tries or to greener pastures
elsewhere.

My suggestion is that Na-
mibia should invest heavily in
higher education in relevant
fields such as medicine and
engineering.

The present level of Science
and Technology programmes
at the University and the Poly-
technic should be elevated and
cach institution should focus
on its state-given mandate,
and develop human capital in
areas relevant to the coun-
try's development strategy at
their mandated levels. ;

After thirteen years of inde-
pendence, Namibia does not
have a medical faculty nor an
engincering faculty at its uni-
versity.

For three years | have been
at Unam, I have seen zero
investment from Government
in the engineering training.
Even the Polytechnic, with its
recently established engincer-
ing school, lacks essential in-
frastructure and human re-
sources to produce competent

technicians, let alone tech.
nologists. Now they want to
become a university! There
is unnecessary and unwar.
ranted competition between
Unam and Polytechnic
which must be stopped at an
costs.

I wish the Namibian peo.
ple success in this more dif.
ficult phase of socio-eep_
nomic liberation. The pre.
scription for AEDS is invest.
ment in science and technol.

,and empowering higher
inctitutions to hire the besy
brains from anywhere in the
world, so that more
Namtbians can be traineg
locally.

That is what even hi
developed countries like the
USA are doing. Replacing
expatriates with ill-trained,
inexperienced Namibiang
for the sake of patriotism, ig
killing this nation directly,
By failing to prepare, you
will prepare to fail.
