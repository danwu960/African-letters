An Insult To The Nation

PLEASE. atlow
NEW SpPaper to ale MN Views Concern
me the aruecle of 12 August 2004,
“Gawverament should not be blamed
For abuse by civif servants”

Phat statement is an insult to the
Namibian nauon,

If we don’t blame our government
then who should be blamed? ft seems
like the government only wants to be
our povernment when they are eat-
Ing Our Money through tax, when i
comes to taking responsibility they
are in denial, they forget that they
are in their chatrs because of us, the
taNPaNve;s.

When will government recognise
the work of NSHR who are educating
Namibians about their rights: thes
have even published many different
books in different languages. If there
was no such education then the abuse
of baste human rights would be worse
than currently.

Those who don’t recognise that

me space mM your

NSH IR are ta tact is doing someing
iehomintous and are denving whatis
contained tn the report, We ciazens
Know whatis happening ta thts country
and weoare not blind. Phe time will
come When the vovernment cannot
dens the truth anymore.

Phe deterioration of human rights in
this country ts causing and increasing
unemployment, poverty, huunger and
disease. The NSHR ts just behind the
truth, fet the NSHR team do their

job without fear and threats from

anyone.

We cannot tolerate the fact that our
economy is feeding our leaders and
we the nation who are in majority and
who put them in power are living in
poverty, Without the NSHR team we
would not have Known these things.
I therefore, congratulate you people
from NSHR.
