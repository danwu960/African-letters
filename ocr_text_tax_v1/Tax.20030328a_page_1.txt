-A Commendable Budget

ALLOW me to congratulate Minister Nangolo
| Mfbumba for producing a well-balanced and equila-

ble budget for the 2003-2004 financial year. Through
tis budger Goverment tried to put its moncy
_ where its mouth is.

The budget is so unassailable that even cnitics are
| finding it very hard w dishoutany cniticism. Through
the raising of the tax threshold, the doing away with

the pension bachJog. the salary increase for public
sen ants. to mention but a few positives, the budget
gives an indication that Government is seriously
addressing the problems of poverty and the chronic
unequal drstnbutron of income that charactenses
this country. This is highly commendable.

Bs producing thus rood budget, Minister Mbumba
has now thrown the ball into the coun of the imple-
ments (the Permanent Secretaries of the various
ministries and the CEOs of parastatals) to see if for
a change they will assist Government to achieve its
deficit and debt targets through efficient spending.

| Well done Minister Mbumba!
