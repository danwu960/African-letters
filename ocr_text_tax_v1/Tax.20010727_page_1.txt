Promises & Propaganda

THERE weretumesy hen one could Say:
One Man one word. Further, one could be
assured that People in official or profes.
Stonal posts were well educated and
pruned for their job

As ume poes by. this is less true.
Maskeung expens, election advisors and
pohhucal correctness have taken over. As
4 resultone can listen to words, but they
have no Content, other than the sound.
To appear in the media is the main aim
of many.

For cxample, the former German
Ambassador promised the Namubian
Public that he would sce to at that
Deutsche Welle TV - half the ume the

the bouquet of Deukom, which is trans-

current German Ambassador does not
live up to the promise of his predecessor.
He is seen in the Namibian media fre-
quently. At one ume he handed over
trucks to the NDF free of charge, but
paid by, again,the German taxpayer,who
knows nothing about this and would
most certainly not agree to the whole
idea. The next time one sees him intro-

Some local day- and nightwatchmen and
wood collectors would be employed as a
