On ‘the hunted’

1 AM a regular reader of your paper,
feeling the need to be broadly inform:
ed- alsoon issues and events which are
often neglected or distorted by other

papers.

Lwas quite shocked though, when be-
ing confronted with your article
“Trophies and the Hunted’ by M Ver.
baan and the editorial ‘A threatened
lifestyle (Both in The Namibian of Oc-
tober 16).

These two contributions to the topic
of Bushmanland appear s0 superficial
and without any background know.
ledge by the writers that I feel obliged
tocomment The only purpose of the
said contributions seems to be one of
sensationaliam and propagandism
aimed at belittling and degrading the
interim government - at the cost of
sound reporting on the Bushmans’
plight and the different possible and
realistic alternatives.

Though | share your views on the il
legitimacy of the interim government
and on soonest implementation of in
ternattonally recognised in
dependence, I do not think that this
warrants bad journalism aiming at
political gain especially on a subpect
asimportant for partofthe Namibian
nation as thisone

In my opinion, the main statement
ls @ positive one, namely, that the
region will not be proclaimed a game
reserve Thisis what the argument was
going on about and what concerned
people had feared would happen Your
statement ‘the Cabinet are obvious
ly going to have to lure the prime
trophy animals such as lion and
elephant into Bushmanland’’ is quite
ndiculous. The ‘game such aslion and
elephant” are NOT '‘going to flock to
the area’’ as M Verbaan states, because
theese species are already abundantly
present in Bushmanland

This ia exactly the problem the
Bushmen are faced with al] the time!
The only possible solution would thus
seem a reduction in numbers by hun-
ting Possibly a very smal! percentage
could be jured out into Koudom game
reserve by additional water holes
there.

Now tothe y hunting, thiecer-
tainly does NOT imply “rifle toting
hunters” flooding the area every
season, or the “region to be inundated
by foreigners armed with highpowered
rifles, searchlights, jeeps and

landrovers”’

Trophy-hunting is a very
sophisticated form of hunting involv.

ing highly-skilled professional
hunters. trackers and camp staff, as
wellasskinners all usually well-paid
and good jobs. certainly not to be
sneered at the way you did in the
editorial

The “season” for trophy hunting
comprises virtually the whole vear. no
flood of rifle-toting hunters is involy-
edusis possible during our two month
“biltong hunting season” and no
spotlights are used whatsoever, as is
the case during the niyght-calliny
operations

This very individualised. exclusive
trophy -hunting reaultsinthe highest
income per hunted animal, while the
hunting operation itself is the best
paid tourrst activity in the country
and all this 1n foreign currency

lam stating these facts after nine
years’ experience ag a professtonal
hunting guide. Ihave also at the begin
ning of thik month. visited
Bushmanland for six daya: NOT toget
a hunting concession, but to inform
myself

During aconversation with Mr Mar-
shal} of the Bushman Foundation, he
himselfcalculated that the income for
one trophy elephant would pay forthe
installation of acomplete cattle drink.
ing point - LIF the income goes to the
benefit of the Bushmen. And this, I
believe, isthe point where work hasto
be done - namely to ensure proper
distribution ofthe income generated,
#0 an to benefit the Bushman
population.

Asfar asl know, Mr Hartung, he too
would see this matter in the same
light, and I would in general agree
with you that - ifsolittle consultation
with the population and the experts
has taken place - this isnot acceptable,
though this does not at the eame time
make the decision takan a bad one.

It certainly isabetter solutionthan
the practice inb the ‘good old days’
when one of the present day interim
government ministers took it upon

himselfto “freethe population of such
problem animals” on taxpayers’ ex
pense by shooting from an army
helicopter
