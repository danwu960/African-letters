Wake Up NFA, For The Good Of Soccer

LET me ar my disappointment with regards to the
recent resignauon of Mr Dumitru as a result of what]
can call poor communication between him and the
NFA executive.

Firsuy I was disappointed by the feedback riven by
the president of the Namibia Football Association on
the might of June 26, which to me didn’t make any
sense :

He was arrogant and rude to the reporter. The NFA
president doesn’t have any natonal interest at hean
He thinks he can meas up and disorgantse Namibian
seccer with whatever knowledge of law he ROL to
promote himself but he should know that what he 1s
doing now 1s actually kalling our soccer.

How far do vou think we are going to goif we keep
on finng and hinng new coaches because you don't
want to help them the way they see how should the

navonal team should be ruled. How much moncy and
how many vears will it cost us to have our team
quah fied for Word Cup or even for the Afnean Cup of
Nauons.

Why should he side with a player (Nauseb)? I'm not
saying the punishment Dumsuu gave 1s jusufiable but
the NFA was suppose to show thei professionalism in
Unis Case. not to come on air and say: “I'm saying a
player must come back in to the team”.

Yes. we know hes valuable to the team butit’s high

ume that players started to become responsible, know-
ing that they are using up the taxpayers’ money and
there are also other players with potential who want to
play for the nauonal team.

Secondly, letme ask some quesuons on the national
soccer team. Look, we have many national teams here
in Namibia in different codes of sport. How many
mes has our soccer team left the country to play
fnendly matches with others eather in the SADC,
Africa or overseas? Answer: none Why? Answer: no
Money How are we suppose to get money? Through
sponsorship and tundraising events.

Having looked at all those questions I started to
doubt the competence of the NFA executive Are they
sleeping or what? When are we going to have our
soccer team tounng the world or Africa after 11 years
? You've heard the rugby team was in Argenuna, the
cricket team 1s in Canada, but what is wrong with the
football body?

So please letthe NFA answer these quesuons We, the
soccer lovers, we lost someone who knew and loved ine
game and had the potential to develop our soccer an

even to take us to the World Cup sunwery and |
As soccer lovers, we will miss Mr Du

wish him all the best in his carce
