® 7 SINCE the Meeption of the Avncultural Diploma in Namibia
. some years back, it had been understood that the purpose of the
y* diploma was to prepare students undertaking the Course for
. fulfilling national objectives so that after completion of their
d w | studies, they should G0 out and teach farmers the methods of
Sy maximum food production from the limited resource (land)
. without exploiting it.
2 a} Some years back, students who graduated trom the three Agri-
F . cultural Colleges, namely, Ogongo, Neudamm and Tsumis

were Immediately taken in by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Water and Rural Development (Mawrd) to fulfil their objec-
tives,

The circle is turning around. Today a lot of Agricultural
graduates end up roaming around the streets of cach and every
town in Namibia without knowing where the future is taking
them. Where should we go?

» viz, Neudamm and Ogongo respec-

graduating,

Where will these Sraduates-to-be go if the Mawrd is sul failing
to employ their previous graduates ?

Someone might Say they should go and take loans from

Agribank as we were told by one respondent from the Mawrd

the previous year. Can anyone give me an Cxample of a bank

What Future For Agriculture students?

which can give loans without an assurance thatthe loan Will be
repaid back (security) ? Some of us never worked before, Where
will we get the security for the loans ?

One of the respondents from the Mawrd hast
better to have educated
ministry still taking
without a future?
Why should they continue on Producing similar fruits Without
a market for them?

Ifthe market is saturated w ith the Current Product why don’t
they try and change the Structure of the Product so that they ¢
produce different products ? a

I know that every

year said, * ni fs
people in the streets”. Why is the

more students ta undergo similar training

not make some renovations to the existing Product. Why is the
Ministry not doing the same ?.

I think itis time the Ministry take this into consideration, The
should realise the cost involved in (raining students and should
also see the nced to employ these students after successfy]
completion of their studies so that they can pay back the uaining
costs through taxes they will be paying to the govemment.
