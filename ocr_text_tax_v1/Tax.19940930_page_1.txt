Gathemann to be preserved

THE letter ‘Call to resist
Sanlam’s plans’ published
in The Namibian of Sep-
tember 23 contains fac-
tual mistakes and
muspercepuions. Kindly
allow us to clarify the
matter.

|. There is no question
whatsoeve, that the
Gathemann and
Kroonprinz buildings in
Independence Avenue
will be ‘destroyed’. To the
contrary, these two his-
torical buildings will be
retained in full, and not
only the facades. Instruc-
tions to this effect have
been given to the archi-
tects. Because the design
poses a tremendous chal-
lenge to the architects, we
were not in a position to
supply The Namibian
with final architectural
drawings at the time of its
report on the 21st which

would have prevented the
unfortunate assertion
“that the plan seemingly
violates historical monu-
ments legislation”.

2. We agree whole-
heartedly that these two
buildings are “not useless
artifacts but working
buildings”. That is why
they will be retained in
full. Insofar as it is neces-
sary, the buildings will be
renovated, repaired and
maintained to remain
‘working buildings’ and
simultaneously be a valu-
able tourist attraction and
an aesthetical asset to the

city. Sanlam has a proud
track record of its devel-
opments being sensitive
to historical, aesthetical
and ecological factors.

3. Thirdly, we would
like to clarify the asser-
tion that Santam 1s a ‘for-
eign developer’. The de-
velopment is an invest-
ment of Namibian funds
on behalf of the thousands
of policy-owners, pension
fund, medical aid, unit
trust and other financial
service clients of the com-
pany in Namibia. As a
mutual company, Saniam
has no shareholders: all

its assets belong to its cli-
ents. Apart from our obli-
gation to earn optimal re-
turns for our clients, it is
our policy to support these
clients and communities
by means of projects and
investments that would
benefit that particular
community. We evaluate
possible investment
projects on an on-going
basis, and would like to
support our clients in other
centres in Namibia as
well.

4. Also in the wider
context, the city and the
country as a whole stand

to benefit in terms of the
employment created and
by way of taxes paid to
the city and the state. As
far as possible we make
use of local labour, local
matenal and local contrac-
tors. Apart from this im-
portant contribution to the
economy, our primary
duty as property investors
is the creation of commer-
cial accomodation. There
is a lack of A-grade of-
fices in Windhoek, as is
bore out by the fact that
the Sanlam centre in In-
dependence Avenue has
been fully let since it was
officially opened by Dr
Libertine Amathila on
October 12 1990.
