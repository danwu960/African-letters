No to strikes

ON Monday morning, the first day of
the strike, when I drove around
Katutura, in all quarters I found the
townshipcalm and quiet. People were
on the way to work, others was
undecided. I noticed no activities to in-
dicate the strike. Small groups of police
were standing around fires at bus stops
to get warm in the cold.

From chats I had with people this
morning and the days before I learned
that all agree that there wasreason for
concern and that something had tobe
done. I also learned that many people
had complaints about what was done
and how the actions were exercised.
They complained about being in-
timidated to obey the call for a stay.
away from schools and work mainly by
meansof what they termed strong pro-
paganda and agitation tostir up mass
hysteria and unrest and sometimes
direct threats or force.

There were too many disadvantages
Instead of more, much-needed educa.
tion for our pupils according to the
slogans of NANSO, there was less
education and less tests Instead of
more pay and a livable salary for
workers there was less pay and a loss
of jobs. Instead of better relations bet-
ween people and between groupsthere
was a disturbance of relations. The
economy lost millions of Rand. The
State lost taxes from which schools.
streets, houses, etc are built and
teachers paid...

South Africa will laugh that stupid
Namiubians cut themselves off from the
opportunities to learn more and to
earn more. In this way we subjugate
ourselves voluntarily tothe principle
of South Africa's divide and rule.

Are we Namibians not abletothink
of more reasonable and wiser actions
which donot disturb relations between
us? Must we harm ourselves? Why not
actions after classes and work? Or
short stay-awavys of fifteen minutes at
certain time and day throughout the
country as a demonstration of sym-
pathy for a certain matter?

Or let the workers work and earn
money (and not strike on certain
dates), and then ask the workers to
donate a part of those earnings into a
funds for financing community
development projects or others. We are
in need ofa private trade school togive
the lot of half-skilled workers the op-
portunity to learn more in their trade
than they can learn during service.
The State has failed to provide the
necessary educational facilities. lam
convinced thatemployers will support
such a project. That isinthe lineofthe
slogansof NANSO andthe Unions for
more education and more pay.

We can do nothing againat the will
of South Africa. Demonstrations and
strikee will bring us nowhere. But ifwe
think cleverly wecan doa lot tothead-
vantage of the country and its people
which South Africa cannot prevent.
