On married women

] WOULD like to raise some
questions concermng the treal- |

ment of mamed women.

We marned women have
problems with the way in which
we are treated by the state
services. | am mamied with
four children, my husband does
not work at all. My salary is
meagre. I went to apply for
medical aid but was told that if
I would like to apply, I could

apply in my own right, but

MAO CNSare WwW ANE

could not register my children.
I was told that the children
should be registered in their
father’s name. I do not know
how he can do so, since he is
not working.

I beg those in authonty to
consider some of these prob-
lems and act accordingly. |
also find some state regula-
tions are very rigid and inflex-
ible.

We as democrats in a socal-
led democratic society should
allow some exemptions. It is
not good enough to say that
you are married and have to be
taxed heavily even though your

husband 1s not employed. They |
must bear in mind that women |
are sometimes the breadwin- |

ners.
