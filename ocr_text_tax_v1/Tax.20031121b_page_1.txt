The Flying Namibian

LHI Plying Dutchman is an opera
Where the captain and his crew cruise
the seven seas and are never seen and
never land anywhere.

This opera is copied by the South
West Atnean Peopleâ€™s Organisation
ol Namibnrorin short Swapo. beould
be called the Flying Namibian.

Heo, all in one. the absentee
pachamentanan, landlord and member
of the ministerial class, flying over all
continents changing hotel rooms and
cies and seldom being seen. He
belongs to the loyal cadres and ts
therefore only responsible to the
Central Commitice and the Politburo
and the sprit of Karl Marx. Some
have lived like that tor 30 vears - first
on the expense of the western or
Laxpayel the
Namibian Gixpayer, for bs years, has
been carrying their costs.

Por the next elections this is an
unsavoury situation. There would be
no them agian.
Therefore one has to mobilise the
masses with different topics. One has
to produce other rabbits out of the
Chat Show cylinder. [tts today, for
example, the commercial farmer or
the US of A. They are insulted
vehemently and frequently. They are
called coloniser, thief or exploiters.
For all these prattlers it would be
better to concentrate on some of
the real problems .

One would welcome the discussion
about the inefficient way communal

cCustern and now

reason to elect

farmers handle grazing tights, the
lousy payment of therremployces of
the shametul managing of their own
water supply after having been piven
free of charge the Wells including the
necessary installed equipment. Where
rs the study of the payment of
agricultural workers inthe tural areas
on communal farms?

A discussion about real colonisers
im the world, who are suppressing
other people tna brutal way by trying
to destroy their cultural identity, is
necessary,

Since AIDS ts transmitted mainly
through sexual intercourse, an open
discussion about mating habits ts
required, The sexual behaviour of
men and women has to change
drastically, What about having more
transparency. by asking people to have
afestona voluntary basts, so thatthe y
can inform their partner? Why ts itnot
possible to ask people only to accept
each other, when they are informed
about the status of there partner? The
repular use of condoms should be lett
tothe infected orsex workers or people
who are changing their partners
frequently for other teasons. Why
wait for the international AIDS-
councitlor caravan wth their
programmes?
