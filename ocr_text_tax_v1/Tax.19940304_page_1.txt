‘Walvis Ray to Nasabia.
& is a great eacouw-

agement for me and oth-

ors who have lost their
lands thet the Govern-
mew should therefore
contimue to procure rapid
ways and ic means
to bring all lands
confiscated from the in-
digenous people by the
colonisers. Portion of

lands, such as
Ozoserekaze and
Omutambomaue need to

be returned without de-
lay to Ovitoto and
Kaokoland respectively.

Walvis Bay of 1878 is
not the same as Walvis
Bay of 1994.

I appeal now to all
communitics who ure
land concemed in Na
mibia to retresh the land

emment and the Cabinet
to re-table the matter

Ndumbu went with the

On your question as lo
what criteria were used
to select Ndumbu, what
you have to remember is
that the President is a
man of the people and is
open to everyone in Na-
mibia regardless of col-
Our ofr race. Even you,
who claim to be recog-

On your question as to
who paid for his wip.
Ndumbu is not a for-
cigner and has the right
loenjoy the fruits of free -
dom as a taxpayer.

You and the Ministry
do not like the man be-
cause he speaks the truth
and points out what has
been done wrong. If stu-
dents want to affiliate
with Swapo that is their
nght because democracy
exists in Namibia.

Swapo is the founder
of Nanso and itis impos.
sible for Nanso to break
away. Those who broke
away should have re
