3. The disappearance
of the Chilean copper
concentrate which was
sent to Tsumeb to be re-
fined at the TCL smelter
iS a very senous matter
and has to be invest-
gated. It was also neghi-
gent not to insure the

apphes to (major TCL
ereditor) Standard Bank
of Namibia - they should
have taken out insurance

ter all. when I buy a car

to take out insurance be-
cause if something then
happens to me I will be
fully covered.

4, Gold Fields South
Africa has a lot of re-
sponsibilities to former
employees who are il
and who will in future
fallall, where their illness
has not been detected yet.
(They say it can take up
to ten or fifteen years for
the symptoms of mining -
related illnesses to show,
except where a worker
was unprotected and in
which case it can take
less than a yeas.)

1 would recommend
that all the money which
1s lett should not be paid
out, but should be depos -
ited into a fund until the
fifteen year penod has
passed, for more in-
stances of ill-health

The Cause Of TCL Ills’

TCL which might still
occur.

What nauseates me.
too, are the frequent ref-
erences to the 1996 surtke
which was supposedly
the cause of the mine's
problems, This 1s in tact
not truc. The largest
problem in fact was thal
people were getting soul.
and that TCL are not
bankrupt but would have
been if they had to pay
all their il) workers.

How can someone scl

cmploy me and then
want to declare himself
bankrupt four and a half
months later? Then tt was
a trick!

TCL’s personnel al-
lowed themselves to be
misled by thinking that
one can nouce the symp-
toms of a lung disease
only after ten to fifteen
years - but it can be de-
tected within a year if the
worker was nol pro
tected.

At TCL... pressure was

cause of this the imegu-
larities occurred where
permission was given to
the cementation section
to dal dry - then they are
not there anymore and it
cam simply be said the
person died of a heart at-
tack. which 4s also true
because this illness after
all also affects the hean
which works together
with the lungs

damage 15 truc, but my
suspicions are different,
that this was a good rea-
son to be used fora plan
to get nd of all the illem-
ployees. Many of the ill
people can after all not

Indeed, voluntary re.
trenchment packages
would have been offereg
but what now when eve.
ryone who opts for these
1s healthy and then they
sit with an itl work force
