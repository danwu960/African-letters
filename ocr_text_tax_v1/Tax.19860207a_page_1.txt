VIS

I WOULD like to address this letter
to both Enok and SWABC.-TV.

Tam doing this because both these
corporations are competing with the
private sector while at thesametime
they enjoy the taxpayer's financial
security.

Both Radio and TV are competing
with private sector advertising
media. Why should they take the
money which rightfully belongs to
the newspapers?

Secondly, why should Enok, the
development corporation, have to
compete with the private sector in
things like wholesalers and garages,
butcheries and so on? There are
many Namibian businessmen who
are capable of running such
businesses.

Instead Enok should be concen-
trating on building factories that will
produce commodities which are
presently imported from South
Africa. This country has no fac-

Corporations compete with private sector

tories, most items are bought from
South Africa. If the Corporation
would start building factories there
would be more yob opportunities in
Our country and things could be
manufactured here. In this way,
things would cost less, and the slogan
‘Investin Namibia, Buyin Namibia’
would become a reality.

Isn't it the job of the interim
government Cabinet to pass such a
bill, instead of a billon stock theft?
Why should the Cabinet evade the
real issues? The label, ‘Made in
Namibia’, should become a fact.

Why does the Cabinet make the
theft of diamonds acrime and yet let
CDM drain the country of diamonds
atthe same time? Rossing, TCL and
Other mining companies are doing
the same.

Why can Namibian towns be built
up like Johannesburg? If the wealth
of Namibia was evenly distributed,
the poorest man in the country

should be living ina house like those
in Arandis.

What 1s the problem with the
‘Cabinet’? Are you really ministers
or just socalled? Our country is be-
ing bled, do something now for
tomorrow may be too late.

Remember: minerals don't breed.
