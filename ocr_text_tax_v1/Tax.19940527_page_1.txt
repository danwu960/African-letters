Thus if the ANC (now
the majority party in the
transitional government)
has to spend the money
of mostly poor and un-
employed Namibian tan-
payers, it will be for de-
velopment programmes
such as housing, educa-
tion and health, while we

tinue to live In poverty
with few housing facili-

ties, notenough schools.

Tamnotreally making
a big fuss about this
money, but no matter
how little it may appear
to those in government
this money ciould have
been quite enough to buy
six months supply of an-
dbiotics for rural hospi-

As aresult of this and
many other reasons, mis-

management

mem funds and other

malpractices are likely

to continue in the future
And wecan almostrest

assured that change will

not be initiated by the

WYFs
government itself, but JOHANNESBURG
