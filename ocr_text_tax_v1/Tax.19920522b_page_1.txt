Is it surprising therefore, that
highranking officials of the
European Community circu-
late reperts about Namibta,
stating that the country lives
on borrowed time? Allow me
one more question: Did the
Honourable Ministers of Trade
and Industry and Finance voice
their strong objections against
tbe purchase of the Presidea-
tal plane for R80 million?

The question to be asked in

this regard, and which has not
been touched upon by either
the press, the Prime Minister,
State House or the Ministry of
Works, is whether it is cheaper
to buy a Presidential jet for
R80 miilion instead of charter-
ing planes? Why did State House
not come up with facts and
figures to silence the critics?
The reason is simple: they
cannot, because itis cheaperto
charter planes ghan to buy one
for R80 million and spend
hundreds of thousands of Rands
a year to operate and maintain
It.

Honourable Mimsters of
Trade and Industry and Finance,
please consider the following:
those who are familiar with
business operations know of
the difficulties to obtain soft
loans from financial institu-
tions in order to start a verture.
Furthemore, it is common

market.
Against this background,

‘al profits (before tax) of
Ro million for each of these 80
companies are not out of reach.
At a corporate tax rate of 42
+ cent, the taxman would
collect R67,1 million from the
80 ventures annually, and ad-
ditional reverme from personal
income tax. If every one of the
80 companies creates 50 job
opportunities, 4000 people
would find work and income
in order to support an addi-
tional 12 000 to 16 000 people,
such as family members.
Economic and industrial
development is what this cour-
try desperately needs,,Honour-
able Members of the Cabinet,
pot lwanous jets for the po-
litical elite. And nobody should
bide behind the statement, that
the cost for the plane is met by
French development aid. Lf this
is the case, it is, indeed, strange
what some people perceive to
be development aid. Aid of
this nature does not contnbute
towards the development of
the nation, but contnbutes
towards the creation of a new
elite. As such, aid of this na-
ture should be rejected with
the contempt it deserves. By
this way, I am sure that the
French public would not con-
done aid of this nature. After
all, it is their tax money with
which the jet is paid for.

In a bitter and protracted
struggle we successfully fought
against the old elite. However,
thousands of brave Namibian
Patnots certainly did not pay
the highest price to help a new
elite establish itself to live in
perpetual hixury and presump-
tuously regard this country as
a self-belp shop, while at the
same time many a Namibian
