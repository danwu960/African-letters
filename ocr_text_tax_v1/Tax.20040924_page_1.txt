| et’s Exoroporiate Ramatex

VD like to commend Mr. Jauch
for the thoughtful, compelling
and accurate reflection on the
deportation of the Bangladeshi
workers, published last Friday,
and] congratulate vou for publish-
ingit. Unfortunately, elsewhere in
the paper. there was an ignorant
attempt at a humorous column
on the same situation.

lt is much to be regretted that
Namubtans, if they think about
the matter at all, simply assume
the Bangladeshis to be foreign
trouble-makers who should tm-
mediately be pot rid of. So little
has been learned from history,
as Mr. Jauch says. We have also
the totally bizarre situation where
irregular work visa, employment
contracts and worker ‘accom-
modation” was seemingly all
organised within one Namibian
family - surely this should be
Invesiigated.

And we have thisequally bizarre
company Ramatex, which seems
to he a state within a State.

Actually I would like to sug-
gest a solution to all this. Let us

just go into the Ramatex facility,

deport the management, and ¢s-
propriate itit. Nothing wrong with
this, despite what the IMF might
say. since in terms of subsidies.
erants, incentives and tax breaks
we have bought the place several
times over.

Run the operation with Na-
mibian manapement, and contin-
ue to supply Ramatex’s overseas
customers as before.

We presumably could sell the
stuff more cheaply since we would
eliminate the huge cut taken by the
present Malaysian involvement.
The staff would then be protected
by Namibian lahour law and be
treated decently, and even the
waste products would be treated
decently. Why not try?
