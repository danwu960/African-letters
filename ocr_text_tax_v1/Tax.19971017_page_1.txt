Musician Street
Names A Joke

THE proposal by the Windhoek Munici-
pality to name streets after musicians like
Louis Armstrong, John Coltane, Elvis
Presley and John Lennon, etc. is not only
laughable, but ridiculous.

How many Namibians have heard or ap-
preciated the music of these people? This
exercise is a waste of taxpayersâ€™ good
money.

Africa has had great sons and daughters
who inspired the liberation of our conti-
nent and who deserve to be remembered:
Kwame Nkrumah, Kenneth Kaunda,
Julius Nyerere Albert Luthuli, Sekou
Toure, Agostino Neto, Hake Selassie,
Edwardo Mondlane, Patrice Lumumba,
Jomo Kenyata, Tafawa Balewa, Samora
Michel and Chris Hant to name a few.

John Lennon Street, Elvis Presley Drive,
Louis Armstrong Avenue is an insult to

our intelligence.
DISGUSTED, WINDHOEK
