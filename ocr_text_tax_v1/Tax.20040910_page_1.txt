RCC Expansion?

IT’s not April 1. so 1 suppose the story is genuine -
the Roads *Con’-tractor company is diversifying into
property development, and at the auction of municipal
stands held a few days ago. a RCC representative. bid-
ding apparendy on an unlimited budget with taxpayers’
money, bought up a large number of these stands, and
in so doing, inflated prices wildly for the other private
bidders. In fact, he spent NS 8.7 million. Nice to know
the RCC has such an amount available, considering the
recent alleged large-scale misappropriation of funds at
the parastatal, and the massive overpayments for mod-
est jobs done.

[ was wondering if the RCC has ever considered “di-
versifying into road construction, bearing in mind the
current state of our roads, e.g. the seemingly abandoned
Okahandja-Karibib widening. and the gravel roads
around the capital Cevery round trip to the Gamsbereg
Involves atleast Wo Hattyres and achipped windscreen).
Just an idea, before we read later how many millions
the RCC has lost in dodgy property deals.
