Detainees respond

THE New Era of November
12-18 published a letter froma
certain Shoye Sheya (Oshakatt)
under the heading ‘Detainees
debate irks reader’.
The letter is characterised
‘by outdated rhetoric and not
only aims at disgracing the status
of the former Swapo detainees
but to stir hatred and blood-
shed among Namibians. It is
. | incomprehensible how a news-
, | paper wholly funded by the
y taxpayer can descend that low
and spread such sick Views.
: Mr Sheya and New Era writes,
| | among others, that ‘the former
South African agents must bear
in mind that it was not Swapo
which sent them to spy in the
_ | organisation’. The letter fur-

ther portrays the Swapo de-
tainees as having been respon-
sible for the deaths of many
Namibians through ‘treacher-
ous ways’.

It must have been during
such a time that Jesus Cunst
shook his head and said ‘Lord,
forgive them, for they don't
know what they are doing ..’ It
is a sad case. Yet, we shall

r | forgive the naive ‘revolution-
. | ary’ Shoye Sheya. But the
; | Shoyas and the New Eras should
be taught to understand our
bitterness.

Let us start with the basics.
The former Swapo detainees
are also former freedom fight-
_ | ers. and many are former Plan

combatants. When the heroic

exploits of Plan fighters and

| the herculean efforts of Swapo
diplomats, nurses, teachers,
mechanics ... will be reflected

- | inthe history books, many ¢x-
i | Swapo detainees will be there.
, |. Yes, the Swapo ex-detainees
+~| and indeed those still being
mmmcatdined by Swapo, are made
menor possibly the finest sons
