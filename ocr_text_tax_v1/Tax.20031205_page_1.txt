Time To Remake Our World

TAM writing this letter in connec-
tron with World AIDS Day. which
was celebrated on December |
My points concern AIDS. HIV,
orphan children, street children,
elderly people and lastly the Gov-
ernment’s spending fever. In this
country we as Namibians should
remake this world from the top
postions in Government to the
lower positions and tn the private
organisations and individuals as
well.

The Government of Namibia

] was very sad when | came

does no even have

across an article in Tie Namibian
of October 22 of how ttle ehil-
dren are being killed by HIV-
AIDS and how orphan children
are increasing. It was sad in the

article that currently there are 82
000 orphan children and that this
figure will double by the year
2015. Andof course another point
is the street children who have
nothing to eat. no place to sleep,
and nowhere to go. [s this prob-
lem the nation’s and 1s it not the
Government's duty to do some-
thing about it. Should this not be
the Government's priority?

The children in our homes are
exactly the same as the children
on the street who are asking for
food and what about the children
thatare in the hospitals with HIV
or AIDS.

Canour Namibian Government
not dv something about this and
bring these problems under con-
trol and try to prevent these prob-
lems.

Can they not do something to
ensure that these problems do not
escalate into even much larger
numbers over the next 10 to 20
veurs?

We have a lack of hospitals.
lack of proper education, while
our Government continues to
build in Windhoek and the other
big towns and they seem to forget
about the smaller rural towns.

We must remember that the old
people that we so easily push aside
are easy targets for robbers and
murderers and if we don't take
care of them properly then who
will? They now have hard umes
Inourcountry but they were look-
ing after us before and now we
need to let them enjoy their rest
and their pensions. We as young
Namibtans should be earine for [
our country and we see the Gov-
ernment making lots of mistakes
and misusing their powerand also
funds, but we do nothing.

People like us should be saving
the nation. we should remake the
world
