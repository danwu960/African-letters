Broadcasting Cover-Ug

1AM at last responding to the letter
NBC Replies that appeared in The
Namibian of February 27 1998.
My accusation that the NBC is
boycotting the Single Quarters scam
still stands. This trial is still ongo-
ing but it was only on NBC TV
News three times. Those on trial are
charged with defrauding the tax-
payers or alternatively of misusing
donor funds. I am not saying that
they are guilty but only the fact that
the money involved is public funds
and we have the right to know what
is happening to our money.
By the way, the NBC is supposed
to be a public broadcaster funded by

us through our tax money and li- |

est what is then of

The nation wants to cow:
hard-earned money they pay
taxes - is spent. oo,

We want to know wheti
elected the right peor
office: .’ ;

We do not wan ae
are only doing good while {ne'ah
being swept under the carp ees

I believe it is the responsibilty ang
duty of the national’ brodticasten ta
keep the nation informéfof thé good,
and the bad happening in our Goy-
ernment. It is not senseless tz t
covering up. NBC, YOU ARE.COY;
ERING UP! Prove me waangts: w
