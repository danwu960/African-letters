what else are being ad-
vanced as the ‘real rea-
sons’ behind the move.

Really, fellow
Namibians ..
AS a concerned tax-

payer and Namibian,
what! would like toknow
iS!

Before being moved
what was Mr Mubita
doing in addition to Talk-
ing Point? And what was
he getting paid for it?

Surely, also, it was Mr
Mubita who created the
storm around himself.

At the end of the last
Talking Point he pre-
sented, it was Mr Mubita
himself who announced
the news that he was off
the show, and the same
Mr Mubita who said that
Talking Point was being
taking off the air “by a
small minority”.

From what we heard
later, this was very far
from the truth. Indeed Mr
Mubita was being moved
or sent for training or
whatever, but from the
official statements there
apparently had never
been any plan to take
Talking Point off the air.

SO, we must ask our-
selves then, what was Mr
Mubita trying to do?

On another level,
surely some sort of ac-
tion should have been
taken against him for

_ deliberately passing on

disinformation. Has it?

Now, every day, mom-

ing andevening, wehave .
