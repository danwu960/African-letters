| CHOOSE to comment publicly on recent Cabinet
decisions concerning retirement benefits for senior
political office bearers and the reversal of salary
increments given to civil servants.

Many civil servants are already affected by the
latter as increments received since April 1997 are to
be recovered and salary notches reversed as Delore
date of increment.

The same Cabinet hired “financial experts” with
taxpayers’ Money to draw up the performance ap
praisal document and the WASCOM report prom:
ised a ten percent (10%) salary increase With effect
from | April 1997 and then kept sMent.

In my opinion the reason for such harsh decision
would be the unexpected ay aiability Of yobs for ex.

combatants inthe publig service, the recent demon:
stration by unhappy nursing staff or the unay atlabil-
ity of funds to finance the retrement benefits for
senior political office bearers. |

Cabinet agreed to“ gamble” without concem with
our pension fund which is our only benefit in the
grey-haired years ahead, yet they seem {0 be con:
cemed only about their retirement ycars.

Few elderly citizens in our beloved country sur
vive on pension-payouts by government al this mo-
ment but it does not concer the Cabinet members.

Unless the government comes clean on their dect-
sions I am of the opinion that civil servants In
Namibia are used to the benefit of their bosses and
that goes for every taxpayer in the Republic of
Namibia.
