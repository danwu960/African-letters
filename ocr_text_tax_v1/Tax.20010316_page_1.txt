“Dear Mr Ngolombe, ifever there Is
4 town in Namibia wath 100 per cent
Colonial pastitis Swakopmund and you
Probably did not realise that January 27
was the Kaiser's birthday! Had
the Bnush not occupied Walvis Bay

le

- have noticed
Ur LOWE has sul]
colonial street

and so denied Germany its natural har-

bour, Sw akopmund would still be bur-
ren desert and you would not be living
in Mondesa,

Atter World War I, Swakopmund
lost the acuvily and income of a
harbour. Over the years the cumung base
had to be changed. The temperature
and climate helped to make it an educa-
ional centre and tounst attraction.

For the latter the preservation and
maintenance of buildings from the
colonial past create an atmosphere
which ts unique on the Afnean conu-
nent. These buildings are not only pho-
tographed or painted by European,

Astin or Amencan Vustlors but also
Africans! A notable part of this herit-
age are the street names, which are the
focal point of many a tourist's camera.

The tourist trade is the main pillar of
the economy of Swakopmundand hun-
dreds if not thousands of our citizens
are dependent onit,as well ts numerous
handicraft sellers from: Atrican coun-
tnes with their stands near state house

Asa trade untonist you should be
more concemed about: - the massive
unemployment in the town, and the
whole of Namibia; - the AIDS crisis.-
the shortage of classrooms and suitably
qualified teachers with the accompany:

Ing dismal pass rate atter ten years of
independence; - the living conditions of
inhabitants im squatter camps Like the
one next to Mondesa; - the Nereasiny
crime fate, alsoun Swakopmund, rather
than wasting money you have noteamed
on changing strect names and thereby
sabotaging the uniqueness of a town,
that you have not founded, but take the
liberty of living an,

I you want to eradicate the colonial
and apartheid past, you wall put Na-
mibla with its present infrastructure
from pnme positon in Afnca nght to
the end of the qucuc. As aconsequence
you will have very few tnends lett

g The Past Will Affect Tourism

dnone your comrades As a WX payer,
Investor and restdent of olg
Swakopmund, fam under the impres.
sion that we who live here and the
business community whocreate wealth
and well-berog forall inhabitants, have
No say inthe issue of street names and
yet everything as made to look very
democratic. Inthe end we will be asked
to footthe bill tor an unnecessary and
costly act. How 1s one to interpret the
daily plea by NBC on reconcihation
other than by cymeism? Hoping that
Sanity will prevail

ERICH FORTSCH, Swakopmund
