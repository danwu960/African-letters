lo Hencethe Namibian worker
aay have to:accept a lower wage to
‘enable our products to sell com.
petitively at international levels, and
to attract foreign investment. This
may well be true. But, attheendofthe
day, the issue ia often a political one,
and, with international acceptance, a
‘Swapo government may wellbe ableto
negotiate favourable quotas and terms
of trade with bodies such as the EEC
and various governments, including
the so called ‘Third World’ countries.
It is, of course, also true that the deci-
sion to be made is essentially one of
deciding what social costs we are
prepared to pay for the sake of ‘develop-
ment’. And, as has already been in-
dicated; we do not believe that that
price has to be very high.

It is also perhaps, here that indepen-
dent trade unions might havearoleto
play in safeguarding workers’ in-
terests. But, and this is, of course,
again, a controversial issue, we may
have to steer clear of ‘ultra-leftist’
trades unions. Not that there is
anything wrong with such trades
unions in principle. But the idea that
blocking, say, the sale of Namibian
uranium, will bring the international
capitalist system crumbling down, or
export revolutions to other countries,
seems, inthe currentclimate, at best,
idealistic, but could involve tremen-
dous social and economic cost on the
part ofasmal! nation that hasalready
had more than its fair share of suffer-
ing under the status quo.

3. DEMOCRACY: Mr. Geingob is
reported in ‘The Namibian’ to have

doctrination and, with the -ses-¢
capitalist values in which we are swint
ming worldwide, the potential {is
strong for reactionary forces te
manipulate the scene. Hence the im-
portance that may, perhaps, have tobe
placed upon responsible media and a
comprehensive educational system.
Freedom of the press, and open govern-
ment are principles that we all sup-
port, but they must be balanced
against society's interest in informed,
as opposed to misinformed, decision
making. Certainly, whilst the racist
regime in the south prevails, these in-
terests might have to be carefully
balanced. What we could certainly not
afford to do, is to let working people suf-
fer so much for independence and
freedom, and then extend the existing
life of concrete reality ina camouflag-
ed form.

IN SUMMARY: It has not been the ob-
jective of this brief article to criticise
what was said, or not said, at the
Lusaka conference. Indeed, the con-
ference was a significant and welcome
political development. Rather, our at-
tempijhas been merely to restate and
keep alive the debate as to the road to
socialist development for Namibia,
after independence. In view of the
debate raging in ‘socialist countries’
atthe moment, tothe extent that some
leading personalities are reported to
have questioned the wisdom of the
revolutions that took place there at all,
as wel] as welcoming extreme right
wing political leaderstoexpound their
obnoxious philosophies to their people,
it is important, even more go for us in
Namibia, toopen up as many areasas
possible for debate - now.
