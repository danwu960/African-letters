Please payus

THE Pian pay-out problem
needs to be solved, and the
Government should by all
means try to do this. We know
there is not enough money for
all the people, but something
can be done. People are con-
. fused when the Minister of

| Information and Broadcasting
emphasises that those who were
not registered in September,
October and November last year
will not get paid.

I personally did not register
at that time, but it was not my
fault. Iwas ina Swapo mission
at that time, and I arrived in
Namibia from Zambia in De-
cember 1990 while the regis-
tranion count had stopped in
November.

When we arrived in Namibia,
we were taken to the Grootfon-
tein army base and we stayed
there for a few days and were
later taken to Windhoek for an
induction. But the programme
failed and we were told to go
back to our families and wait
to be called. Up to now none of
us has been called. We want to
| ask the Minister whether we

are to be blamed for late regis-

tration in these circumstances?

We stayed behind (in Zambia)

because we were ordered to

and not because we chose to.
Please, Minister Hidipo, try
to understand our problems.

We appreciate the programme

set up by the Government for
_ some of the former fighters to |

“be integrated into the develop- |

ment bngades, but it will not
accommodate all ofus. Then if
we are trained, we are still not —
assured of jobs. Look at all the |
people trained in formerGDR, |
