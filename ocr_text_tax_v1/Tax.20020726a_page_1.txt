But the Namibian
economy is different. It
should be called Give-
Away. Here the taxpaycr
pays the unknown bill in
advance or later, and some
customers or some man-
ager of some employees
runaway with the goods or
the service or the salary
without delivering an ad-
equate compensation.

This has been exercised
in many different outfits,
which are created and
sponsored by the govemn-
ment of the day. Manage-
rial posts are filled with
sometimes unfit, buttested
and loyal party cadres.

short reaction from the

pompous statements

Anyhow, the two un-

the following:

1. Ramatex is nota min-

2. Ramatex has not
started the knitung proc-
ess and is not cutting gar-
ments. But they are pack-
ing finished garments.
(Question: Manufactured
by whom and where?)

4. Ramatex has a strong
code of conduct with an
independent venfication
and public reporting. (Re-
mark: This is certainly up
to now not true for the
Namibian taxpayer)

4. Ramatex has pegged

cient to meet the basic
needs of the persoonel.

What the management
of Ramatex was not told 1s
that the previously disad-

exaggeration, but only
slightly.
