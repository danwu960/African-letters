| What’s Air Namibia’s Future’?

LATE last year I flew with Ai Namibia trom
Windhoek to Frankturt and returned carly this yout

again from Frankfurt. The flights were fantastic. and trom. 1

despite the hard times Air Namibia sul provided us
witha tull bar, two hot meals trom which to choose,
the latest movies and music and a Vanety of duts-
free items. . .

The cabin crew were friendly and assisted the
passengers throughout the flight, the captain on
board informed us about our flight route and pro-
vided us with other useful information. I was very
impressed with the service in the economy class,
which was so much better than other airlines tlying
the same roule.

However, it concerns me that the business class
section was nearly empty. J saw only three passen-
gers seated there at take-off and sections in the
economy class were also emply. Many passengers
had a comfortable nights rest on three or four seats.

Due to the fact that this was the brand new Boeing
747, and it is not yet paid for, the question ishow sill
