How long have we been subject to unjustified
Monopolies in this country - being Telecom and
MTC. I believe the second cellular licence will also
be awarded this year or early next year

Itis a requirement of the World Trade Organiza
tion (WTO) that all telecommunications markets he
open for compettion by the year 2004, which ts just
around the comer. Our Governmentin the [elecom-
munications Policy and Regulator Frames ork pub
lished in September 1999 recognised the tact that
competition will come for sure

Now at the workshop of May 29, nearby three
years after the Government policy 4s published,
the Legal Adviser of Telecom Namibia Ltd
pleaded for another exclusivity period for voice
telephony.

My very strong plea goes to the Hon Minister
Theo Ben Gurirab and the regulator. being the
Namibian Communications Commission, ty gn
ahead and open the telecommunications market tor
competition. Refuse to let the mighty Velecom Na-
mibia Ltd. once again bring toa halt the telecommu-
nications restructunng process that was started in
1992.

Telecom Namibia Ltd has had a period of ten
years exclusivity in which they had enough tune to
prepare themselves for operating ina free tai and

open market

On the other hand MIC has had a exclusivity
penod for seven years and has hasically coxered the
main towns of Namibia with aecess to mobile te-
lephony

The actual crux of the matter is ac want te hase
