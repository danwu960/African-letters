Opening Up
The Skies

THE application for a licence by Quickjet Pty
Ltd serving before the Namibian Transport
Commission (NTC) presents an interesting op-
portunity to test the new leyislation passed at
the end of last year amending the Air Services
Act of 1948,

The new legislation specifically removes any
protection against competition for Air Namibia
and TransNumib.

The applicant viz Quickjet is a company
funded with private money and in no way relies
on government for financial ussistance. It is
backed by Namibian Harvest Investments, a
public company whose aim it is to empower
Namibians. It 1s unlikely that any other appli-
cation involving a similar amount of money
(N$1O million) will come before the NTC apain
In the near future.

While it is known that there is another airline
viz Kalahari Express that is also supposed to
serve the Fros-South Africa routes, this airline
has after some two vears not been able to start
operations and it in any case now resorts under
Air Namibia, a company making heavy losses
and becoming an increusing]s heavy burden on
the taxpayers. If Kalahari Eapress is to be run
by Air Namibia with the same degree of
unpunctuality and unreliability as its own serv-
ices then it is certainly in the public interest that
a privately funded airline be given an opportu-
nity to provide an alternative to the travelling
public.

It will be interesting to see how the NTC views
the Minister of Works Transport and Commu-
nications’ latest piece of Icgislation aimed at
making the transport sector more competitive
and less reliable on public (taxpayers’) money.
