VAT Vendors Beware

COULD you please wam all registered
Value Added Tax vendors to beware of the
latest absurdity that the Receiver of Rev-
enue has come up with.

If your VAT payment 1s late or your
cheques bounces, then they enforce sec-
tion 68 (1) of the Value Added Tax Act
which states. “A person who fatls to pay
any tax payable under this act on or before
the due date for payment shall be lrable for
the payment of a penalty which 1s the
greater of an amount of N$100.00 for each
day dunng which the tax payment remains
outstanding” etc. This happened to achent
of mine who had to pay an amount of N$
1100.00 but forgot to sign the cheque that
he used for the payment. The cheque was
therefore refused by the bank and the Re-
ceiverclaimed inexcess of N$13000.00in
penalties as well as N$ 1800.00 in interest.
Well, this is where they are wrong.

If the officials from the Revenue offices
would take the time and effort and carry on
reading section 68 of the same Act, they

will notice under the same section, namely
subsecuon 2, i states quite clearly and |
quote: “The penalty imposed under sub-
section | shall not exceed the amount of
unpaidtax”, unquote. This means that when
a person owes NST 100.00, the maximum
penalty may only amount to N$1100.00.
Therefore, if a taxpayer fails to hand ina
Nil return, then no penaluies may be 1m-
posed.

I would be gratetul to your newspaper tt
these facts could be taken up with our
Receiver of Revenue and our readers ac-
cordingly informed. | wonder how many
taxpayers have already paid amounts in
excess of whatthey had to. The responsible
officer at the Receiver is a Mr. Kenny
Clocte. | attach copies of the relevant,
sections of the Value Added Tax Act.
2000. (Act 10 of 2000).
