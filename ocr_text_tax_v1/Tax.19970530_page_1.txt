‘What A Swakop Disgrace’

SWAKOPMUND fs one of the old-
est towns und one of the biggest tour-
ist attractions in Namibia. How ever,
8S S00N as iC Starts fo ruin, even only
a few drops, the streets of this town
turn into instant salt puns. The mud
has to be sprayed off the cars as soon
as possible, otherwise the cur Jisup-
pears from underneath you us the
rust cuts its way Chrough. It is for-
bidden to clean the mud off your car
in the streets and nobody knows
what to do with the salt drenched
KY psum on their erven which in fact
belongs to the Municipality. To
steam clean your car in Windhock
costs N$70.

Only ou small portion” of
Swakopmund has tarred or inter-
locked streets. [, as u rate and tan-
payer of the town, would like to
know when and whether the council

will replace this mess with properly

tarced roads, Every small town in Na-
mibia, whether it is Otavi or Outjo,
has more kilometres of tacred road
than Swakopmund and [am sure
their rates and taxcs are not as high
us OULS.

Since the Prime Minister now ovis
a property in the new extension, nu
one Would be surprised if the council
decides that the ruad leading to his
mansion should be tarred/inter-
locked. Thankfully then a few pro-
ple will be able to share a decent rad,

Ifthe town Of Swakopmund looks
like a pigsty, what about Mondesa
and Tumuriskia? Why is it that
Walvis Bay has tarred roads and
Swakop not?

Hopefully the town councl will ne.
ply through the Press on what their
intentions are.
