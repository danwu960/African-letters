Police taxis?
ALLOW me, as a taxpayer, to
air my grievances to the pub-
lic, and especially to the Min-
ister of Home Affairs.

Since independence I have
noticed that policemen don't |
do their duties properly any-
more. We as taxpayers are |
confused by the manner in which
police vans are used. They are |
now acting as taxis between â€”
Khomasdal and Katutura and
police are transporting friends,
and girifnends, from mghtclub
to nightclub, especially from
the following places: Club
Thniler, Pamoda, Namibia Nite
and Suidwes Cafe.

People who lay charges wait
from between two to five hours
because they are told there are
no cars available, but in the
meantime they are being used
as above.

In this case I see that the
police are exploiting the tax-
payers, myself included. I think
itis better to employ 10 police-
men to do their duties properly
than to employ 100 who ex-
ploit the taxpayers.

It is far better to use police
cars for people who call for
help instead of sending them
out todo taxi jobs. Think about

Our taxpayers money please,
