The Jungle Of VAT

ALLOW me to put my
views on the complicated
issue Of Value added tax
as il roused my interest
when PT saw the letter im
your newspaper of Octo-
her 5, 2001.

It one looks at the way
VAT as handled, one feels
that the Ministry should
reduce the income Gis in
order for people to cope
with the VAT which came

Ary

into existence. In your let-
ter nol much is given in
terms of the whole system
of VAT. Tome VAT as it
stands for valtie added tax
isworse than any other Gin
system as it trtes to cater

Lets prove it trom this
example:

Producer: cost S100 +
profit (206) + VAT
(tS =S13.80

Wholesaler Cost

($13.80) +protit (20% 7 +
VAT CLSo=819.04
Retailer: cost ($19.04)
+ profit (20%) + VAP
(15% )=$26.28
Consumer
costs $26.28

Rather than your view:

cost ($10) 4 profit
20% 4 + VAT
(15° )=$13.80

lused the above caleu-
lation because ia Namibia

there are few Gf not no)
products which vo directly
trom the manufacturer to

ther the overheads which
might be
