DURING the course of

last week, Stocks &

Stocks Nambia (Pty)

Ltd issued a lengthy

statement in which the

firm attempted to throw
some lighton the history
of certain projects which
they constructed or for
which they submitted
tenders. These projects
include, among others,
the Brendan Simbwaye
Square office block, the
Bank of Nanubia butld-
ing and the proposed
Government Office
Park.

Reterenee is made to
the role which I am al-
leged to have played in
precipitating certain de-
cisions, for instance with
regard to the award of
the contract for the erec-
uion of the Bank of Na-

NamDeb Donation Diemic

mirbia Building, Tt ys also
implied that I have fe,
vently opposed the con.
stucuon of the Govern.
ment Office Park,

I would like to clarify
mercly three issues:

I. The award of the
Bank of Namibta build.
Ing contract to the Inter-
national/Grinaker
Constortium remains to
be in the best interest of
both our Chent and the
Namibtan taxpayer
without a shadow of at
doubt. Since Stocks and
Stocks Namibia (Pty)
Ltd appears dissatisfied
with the award, they
should of course feel at
liberty to IMStitute such

remedial action as they
consider appropriate, —
2. Concerning My at-
Gitude with regard to the

SORStruction of the Gov.
