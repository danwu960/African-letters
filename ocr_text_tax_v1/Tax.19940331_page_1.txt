Unhappy
academics

THREE Namibian academ-
igs in the US are unhappy
with the University of Na-
mibia for various reasons
Together they have written
along letter with regard to
their grievances which The
Namibian will publish in
three parts We request
feaders not to take this asa
precedent. for such lengthy
communications have to be
summarised in the normat
course of events - Editor

ON [1 February 1994 we
spoke out about the lack of
genuine effort by Unam's
leadership to recruit quali-
fied Namibians We stated
our concern that non-
Namubians have enjoyed
higher prirority in filling
positions atthe untwersity -
in faculty and management

In reference fo that letter,
Zac Kazapua, Registrar of
Unam. responded on 18
February. As for his mono-
phonic statement, it farted
to address the issues raised
and we find it to be lacking
essential details and there-
fore totally misleading. We
tefute his version of a
“straightrecord’ We detail
our individual accounts of
yod searches at Unam then

DR JOSEPH DIESCHO
(POLITICAL SCIENCE)

On 2 December 1991 the
Department of Political
Studies at the Academy
made me an offer of a posi-
tion of lecturer, T had ac
cepted the postition and was
teady to tetum (> Namibia
in the course of 1992. Be-
fore my tetum, the then
Vice-Chancellor Desig-
nate. Dr Peter Katjavivi,
asked me to stay on en the
US and stam a fundraising
campaign tor Linam Twas
told that was as good as
working at the university
itself, and 1 accepted the
challenge as | myself was
NOC too comfomable wath
the Acadenty

At that time, Katjavivi
himself communtcated to
the Department of Political
Studies in the second se-
mester of 1992 thar 1 was
no longer coming because
he. as the new chiel execu:
tive officer of Unam, gave
Me anew assignment inthe
US. My appointment as Di-
tector of the Fund for the
Vawersity of Namibia in
New York after the person
Kayasive first appointed
and under whom | was go
Ing to work, was rejected

Letters te the

by Frnends of Namibia in
New York. Many people in
New York refused to ac-
cept that f, as a black Na-
mibian with two doctorates,
and with specialised know!-
edge of Namibia's history
of education, was appointed
to work under a person
whose only claim to fame
was that she was an Amen-
can white woman, This per-
son was Ms Melissa
Bruemmer, a friend of
Katyavivi’s who atthe time
had just completed ber mas-
ters degree at Columbia
University. My appoint:
ment was to be from June
1992 to June 1993 after
which | would be either re-
trained in New York or re-
calledto take upteaching at
Unam. To this date, my sal-
ary as per contract has not
been paid. Bruemmer, who
did not even sit one day in
an office to do fundraising
for Unam, was paid US$12
000 simply because Dr
Katjavivi promised her that
salary.

I stayed on as director of
the campaign for the whole
year without pay. Upon in-
quiry into my future in June
1993. now Vice-Chancel-
lor Katyavivi advised me to
stay with fundraising until
a decision way made in
Otober at a mecting with
the Advisory Board of the
Fund of the University of
Namibia in New York

On 3 August Dr Hugh
Afnea, the Dean of Stud
Its, wrote to me tnfomming
me that Professor Gerhard
Totemeyer had recom-
mended that the 1991 Acad-
emy offer be reactivated.

cate whether | was inter:

longer in existence and in
the light of the recently
completed faculty evalua:

that it would be appropri:

offer made in « riting by the

The Registrar statement
1s contrary to what the true
record shows Before writ
ing this response. I tel-
ephoned both Protys
Gechatd Totemeyer and
Andre du Pisani to find out
what they knew about this
matter. Totemeyer (for
metly Dean) referred me to
Du Pisam (Acting Dean of
Faculty of Economics and
Management Sciences)
who told me that the post
was not advertised us yet.
and that he would welcome
my application once they
were ready. According to
Du Pisani, the post I would
be considered for is only a
contract post, such as those
filled by non-Namibians at
Present. Itis rather interest-
ing that Unam’s Registrar
states that | have tumed
down a post that was ne1-
ther offered nor advertised

The meeting at which my
position with the Fund
would be determined took
place on S$ and 6 October
1993 During the meeting
the Advisory Board
requrested Katjavivr to let
me direct the campaign until
September 1994. Kayjavivi
and his team, Afmes and
Ms Judy Diers, agreed to
the request. The Advisory
Board raised strong obdjec-
tontothe fact that! worked
for more than a year with-
out a salary Dr Katjasivi
promised to take care of
this matter as soon as possi:
ble. On 14 Octuber 1993,
before Dr Katyavivi and his
team left for Namibia, ata
meeting to plan the direc-
bonofthe fundraising cam-

about when it was very clear
