Women on tax

I WOULD like the Finance
Minister, Dr Otto Herngel, to
clanfy a few points concem-
ing the article “Women to benefit
from tax changes’ in The
Namibian of Monday January
27.

The article said that there
will be changes in the current
discriminalion against women,
particularly mamed women.
My questions are:

- why is the emphasis only
on mamed women? Is is be-
cause unmamied women do not
pay taxes or is it because they
are not discnminated against?

- why should married women
be singled out as victims of
discrimination and what is the
case with unmarried women in

this regard?
