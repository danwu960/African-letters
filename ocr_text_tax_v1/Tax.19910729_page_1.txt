the Ministry of Transport and |
Works’ intention to start wid-
ening the road to the airport
within the next few weeks. I
was under the impression that
the government didn't have
money to throw around!

The report states that “the-
road improvements will knock
time off the tedious journey to
the airport”. Are we, as a de-
veloping country, with a des-
perate shortage of fundamen-
tal facilities such as schools
and hospitals, really able to
justify spending millions of
Rands merely to relieve a few
privileged people of a little
frustration?

It is interesting to look care-
fully at exactly the sort of time
that is going to be saved by the
road improvements. For the
forty kalometres from the
Windhoek city limits to the
airport, the youmey takes 30 |
minutes at an average speed of |
SOkm/hr. Were improvements
to make it possible to dnve at
an average speed of 1OOkmY/hr |
the journey would be reduced |
to 24 minutes.

A much cheaper solution to
the problem of getting to the
airport on time would be to
leave home six minutes earlier
than usual.

I] am sure thal the argument
will be raised that a widened
road will also be a safer road;

- that in the long run there will

be fewer fatalities. Although I
don't believe that this ts even

(three lane roads have in many
cases been shown to be the

| moet dangerous of them all) I
feel that improved safety is not
| a good enough justification in

any case. At the rk of sound-
