Smelly: Mam arwrials-ia

ALLOW me to air my dissatisfaction
about the unfavourable odour in
Tamariskia and Mondesa townships.

The inhabitants of these towns face
a huge problem which ts the never-
ending small of what seems to be
human eacreta. The smell is worst in
the houses situated in the place known
as ‘Old Tamuariskia’.J want to ask the
Town Council of Swakopmund about
the removal of the controversial sew-
age dam from the middle of the resi-
dential area.

Asamatter of fact the former white
municipal council was blamed for
building the sewage dam among resi-
dences of the blacks. But after the
white council was voted out of power
and the current councillors vowed to
remove it if they were elected, noth-
ing happened.

It seems these were just empty
promises. The explanation that there
is Not enough money to remove the
sewage dam Is not fair as we pay our

rales and taxes as other home owners
and are entitled to breathe fresh air as
others do. Imagine waking inthe night
and tinding your house smells like
someone has just detecated on the
floor and after investigation you find
the whole house smells like that. It
might affect us in other ways too as we
are obliged to constantly use air fresh-
eners to make things bearable.At
present Swakopmund is undergoing
structural changes and the town will
receive tourists and would-be home-
owners and Fcan assure the Council no
one would like to stay in such condi-
vions.

Please convey my request to the
town council to look fora suitable site
to relocate the sewage dam - before
someone becomes sick and considers
claiming huge sums of money from
our already ‘poor’ town council.
