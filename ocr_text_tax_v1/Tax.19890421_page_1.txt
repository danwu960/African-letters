| Trying to rent

WE HAVE heard a lot about

property prices in the local
press from the point of view of those
trying to buy houses. But what about
those unfornmnaie few who are at-
tempting to rent a house here at the
moment. My own experience may be
of interest.

] arrived in Windhoek on April 2 to
begin lecturing at the university. On
Friday (7th) I telephoned all 19 es-
tate agents listed in the Windhuck
directory. Of these, only five had any
property for rent and the total num-
ber of houses available was nine. The
average monthly rental for these prop-
erues wes R1995, approximately two
third of my net salary.

I would hope to find a three-
bedroomed house with a small gar-
den, for my family which includes
two children and two dogs. The cheap-
est house of this kind available, ac-
cording to the agents, would still
have absorbed more than half my
Salary after tax. Should I sell my
eight year old bakkie in order to buy
& newer car with seats for my two
children, then the repayments will
further reduce my income after ex-
penditure on food and electricity to
the point where a doctor's bill or car
service would put us into the red.

If I am having this sort of trouble
as a university head of department,
how can other newcomers to Wind-
hock survive unless supported by
Untag salaries or company rent sub-
sidiaries? The town seems suddenly
to have become a jungle full of cyni-
cal and avaricious property landlords,
unrestrained by any semblance of
local rent contro] or moral conces-
sions to providing ‘*value for money’’.

If we are to attract the kind ofskilled
personnel to Windhock who are needed
to train Namibians in the roles cur-
rently occupied by outsiders such as
myself, then either the excesses of
loca) landlords must be curbed, or
there must be e considerable im-
provement in the inducements of-
fered by local employen, particu-
larly in the state sector,

I left South Africa for political
reasons. | would hate tohave to leave
Namibia for purely economic ones. .
