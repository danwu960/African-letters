Call For ‘Clear, Objective’
Reporting From Dr Tjingaete

IFOUND your editorial
comment “A call for
more productivity” in
which the report of the
Auditor-General tor the
financial year ending
March 31 1993 to be
most tHluminating

Vhere are a number of
points which [ beheve
deserve further com.
ment.

Firstly, a person who
should be ‘independent
and objective’ should use
such expressions which
reflect his or her obyec-
tivity.

The Auditor-General
has created for himself a
problem of expression
for future reports.

The use of expressions
as ‘culprits’, ‘fraud 1s
rampant’, ‘outstanding S
& TE allowances have
reached alarming pro-
porbons’, ‘chaotic fash-

ion’ as these terms are
all relative to one of de-
gree and substance

For instance, the ¢x-
pression ‘rampant’ 1s
used denoting that a situ-
ation has arisen where
the incidence ot fraud
has reached uncontrol-
lable (mass or mob) pro-
portions and the perpe-
trators thereof are doing
tin an aggressive and
defiant manner.

The Ministry of For-
eign Affairs 1s one of
those singled out where
traud 1s rampant.

Now when one checks
the AG’s own comment

under ‘Auditor opinion’
on page 86 of the report,
reference is only made
to one incident of thelt,
in| which Zambia
Kwacha were stolen and
on page 96 under
subparagraph 3.7.7.2.
‘Fraud'theftumisuse of
government property
and manpower’ the Au-
ditor-General himself
reports: “Nothing in this
regard was reported to
me by the accounting
officer nor were any de-
tected during the verifi-
cation of annual report
informauon.”

Come on Dr Tyingaete,

be farr. does this add up
to rampant fraud’ orare
you guilty of using your
independent office to at-
tack the Minister of For-
eign Affairs because he
dared to criticise you?
This surely seems to
be the case as you ven
disappointingly on page
3 question the right
privilege of cerainmem-
bers of the National As-
sembly to do what they
are appointed to do and
that tS to question the
acts, atutudes and com-
ments of any person
which they regard appro-
priate lo raise in purlta-

ment

Yoursensitivity to this
Situalon suggests vou
are not able to take erit-
cism (which you must
accept as part of the
democratic process) but
you feel free to criticise
others in a subjective
fashion, whereas your
high office calls for a
clear head and objective
reporting

Finally, | tind the par-
allel of your comments
and those of the DTA
most amusing. (Is there
a mutual “hot hine’ and tt
So, who is paying for it-
the taxpayers’)

Greetings, and we are
looking forward to next
year’s report and the
‘rampant flow of exces:
sive CApressions”
