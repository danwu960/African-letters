Open Letter To President Bush On AIDS

I AM sending a copy of this to
PresidentSam Nujoma of Nambia,
one of the countnes that desper-
stely needs some help with this
immense public healthissue. [have
spentaconstiderable amount of ume
in Namubia and have friends there,
mcluding a black woman science
teacher who recently wrote in part:
/ am out in Kavango and the
problems here are so acute that...
Jam spending time with 6-year olds
in one household... 36 orphans

eee ee So

with the grandmother whose own
children have all died of AIDS
... Donors do not come this side of
the country and remain in Windhoek
only. The decision-makers have no
clue or do notcare. It hurr to see
these young girls pregnant be-
cause that is the only way they can
feed their families.”

I am embanassed and annoyed,
Mr. President. that my country 1s $0
belated in proposing funding
for substantive action on AIDS in

Africa Pwould rather have the cost
ot half a dozen Trident IH mussiles
(which are made tn my home town
and paid for with MY tax money) be
spent on building health

But] amesven more annoyed and
saddened that the religious seal
otry that permeates your adinints
trabon has contamimated this feu
islavon by denying moncy to sex
workers, and fo anyone who has
advocated abortion and requiring
that 1/3rd of the education money
be spent on advocating abstinence
Those views deny the reality of the
situations.

Please eradicate these conditions
of funding and promote the deliver:
ance of the AIDS aid to where it ts
most needed... NOT to holding
mectings in air-conditioned offices
about how the money should be
spent and then buying Ford Broncos
to go out into the harsh environ-
menttotell people not to have physi-
cal contact. The survivors of those
36 children, if any, will populate
my grandchildren’s world. With
malnourished bodies and little edu-
cation they can hardly become good
Namibians, let alone good world

citizens.
