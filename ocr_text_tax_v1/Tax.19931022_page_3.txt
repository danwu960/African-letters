unfair to link this matter
to the past, as Mr Sievers
has stated: “They no
longer deserve privileges
or sympathy, It is now
for them and not the tax-
payers, to bear the con-
sequence of their negli-
the past”.

Let us assure Mr
Sievers that the commer-
cial farmers are commit-
ted to this country and its
people and would not like

to lay claim to anything —

at the expense of any
person or sector. And
they are taxpayers as
well.
