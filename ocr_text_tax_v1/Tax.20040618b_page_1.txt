UNAM Needs A Tested Leader

ALLOW me to air my
views about our one
and only University of
Namibia with regards
to leadership change. In
many universities around
the world, when a chief
execuuve leader leaves,
the governance of the
university see il as an
Opportunity to bring in
someone else from out-
side of the university or
even the country, with
tested leadership, new
ideas and the ability to
change the university for
a better future.

Inomy view. Namibia
needs toemulate tis style
In recrutiing for the new
Nice Chaneellor of the
Universtt. of Namibia
and look Lor someone who

Is mnovative, vistonary,
transparent and able to
paint a better history of
our university, different
from the previous one. A
leader who will make sure
that financtal maladmin-
istration and bankruptcy
does not happen: that itis
nota dumping ground for
useless and retired profes-
sors: to eliminate shaky
admission procedures
that allow unscrutinized
foreign certificates and
a lack of clear vision
and strategic planning
should be things of the
past. Today. unsversits
leaders worldwide are
well versed in tssues that
add value to natronal de-
velopment goals of therr
Where

COUNTIES, ISSULCS

such as access to higher
education, knowledge
based economys, relevant
research and production
of a highly educated
workforce are not just
spoken about but are
goals that are achieved.
UNAM needs a leader
who believes and mot.
Vales its human resources
to perform to the best of
theirknowledge and make
them worthy of the moneys
invested inthe University
by Namibran taxpayers.

Henceacallfora tested
leader, an outsider, with
afresh viston of whats
national unis crsity should
do for tts Countss
