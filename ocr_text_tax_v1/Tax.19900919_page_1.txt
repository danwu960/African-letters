Liquor tax

THE sight of a dreadfully drunk and
miserable woman in Gobabis Road
recently drew the attention of motor-
ists who had to swerve their cars;

destrians’ simplistic reaction was
either to laugh or shake their heads.

Alcoholism is the worst social
problem in Namibia and of course it
ig linked to factors such as poverty.

While problem drugs such as
Mandrax attract more of a sensation,
there’s a far easier means {0 contnb-
ute to solving part of the problem
they present: ‘Pushers’ all over the
world know perfectly well that they
can ruin their lives having to serve
stiff jail sentences if caught and found
guilty.

But because liquor is so socially
acceptable, no one thinks of those
who sell it as people who share the
same responsibility for social miser-
ies as drug peddlars.

1 would be most surprised if sell-
ing liquor does not carry one of the
highest profit margins for formal and
informal entrepreneurs in southem
Afnca.

How about a tax being charged on
every drop of liquor which lines these
merchants’ pockets to sponsor a
rehabilitation centre for Namibians
unable to cope with alcoholism?

And let’s face it, a broad range of
people can be victims of alcoholism:
from shanty-dwellers in Damaraland
to inhabitants of posh Ludwigsdort.

If owners of licenced bottle store
outlets claim that informal ‘cucas’
and tombo sellers are equally re-
sponsible - tombo is frequently made
from powder which originates from
licenced shops with books to which
the Ministries of Finance and Health
end Social Services should have access.
