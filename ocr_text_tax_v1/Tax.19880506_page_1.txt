Questions to Mo

WHILE listening. to the interim
government mouthpiece (the SWABC)
in Katima Mulilo, | was shocked to
lear what Minister Mo, the former
Chairman of the Cabinet, terma ‘im-
portant events’ which took place dur-
ing his chairmanship. He mentioned
the following:

{> Dr Franz-Josef Strauss’ visit to
Namibia as being important both na-
tionally and internationally;

(] the Cabinet's visit to Jonas
Savimbi;

[.| the Supreme Court's decision on AG
8,

{ the Oshakati bomb blast which
claimed many lives;

Would anyone whois really serious
about the Namibian issue term these
events asimportant? Just what did Dr
i Strauss do to classify his visit as ‘im-
portant?’ Eis visit was as fruitless as
the recent recent of the men in suits
J (one with a matching ostrich-skin
briefcase and shoes). All these visits,
instead of taking usa step forward to
independence, have merely tried to
blindfold us.

The Cabinet's visit to Jonas Savim-
bi was also futile. Just toflyinandout
of a sovereign state without a passport
and visa, and at the taxpayer's ex-
pense, is as useless as trying to walk
against a wall.

And the Supreme Court's ruling on
AG 8 wagjust as useless because there
was Super Louis to resist it.
| And what issoimportant about the

Oshakati bomb blast to Minister Mo?
lathisan ‘important event’ which took
place during your chairmanship? |
weep to hear a leader speaking that
Way,

The last thing Mo mentioned was
himselfand Mr Kozonguizi pushing a
car on the way back from the airport
when they accompanied the men in
suitson their way back to South Africa.
Just to push a skorokore makes them
feel great!

Come on, Mr Katjiuongua, we know
you are smart. Just put your brains

| where your people areandridyoursell |

and others of this puppet regime.

Just what makes you proud about all |

that, beats me!
