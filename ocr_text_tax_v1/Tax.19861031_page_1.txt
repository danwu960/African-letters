White settlers

WITH greet fanfare and pomp, the
white settlers in the town of Oranje-
mund started on October 18 this year
to celebrate what they call the 50th bir.
thday of Orenjemund. Celebration will
take a whole week of dining, wining,
not to speak of dancing and rejoicing.
Namibian workers staying in the
town of Oranjemund and in the labour
campe called hostels, were asked to
take part in the celebrations The re-
quest was seen by the Namibian
workers as an insult in that it re-
quested them to take part in
celebrating an event commemorating
the colonial dipossession of the Nam).
bian people and exploitation of our
country. The town came into existence
asaresult of the labour of workers who
have contributed so much but have not
been justly rewarded. The town 1s
therefore inextricably linked to the
mine. It is also not an exaggeration to
assert that without the Namibian
migrant workers, the town in question
would not have been established
The celebration must be exposed for
what it is. The settlers are not
celebrating the birth of the town of
Oranjemund, but the more than 50
years of plundering one of our most
valuable resources by CDM and the
government of the colonial power
It was diamonds from CDM which
have principally fuelled the colonial
machine over the past 70 years Nami.
bian workers recall with a deep sense
of anguish the fact that during the 60s
and early 70s CDM generated an
average of 75 percent of mining sector
taxation
Workers are aware that companies
like CDM are anxious tostmpthe coun:
try bare before a government of the peo-
ple can bring its natural resources
under its control. CDM, for instance,
hasinthe late 1970s, maintained pro-
duction at 25 percent above average
levels. It has and is still, overmining.
It is even an open secret that CDM is
going all-out with a round-the-clock
three-shift system to raise output to
the highest possible leve). Such is de
Beers tight contro! over diamond
marketing that not even South Africa
can check whether it has secretly
stockpiled undeclared gems from
Oranjemund. Theee and other exports,
are illegal in terms of the Interna-
tional Court of Justice verdict of 1971
and UN Decree Number 1 on natural

resources of Namibia, are
stealing the birthright
of the Namibian nation.

We, the toiling, sweating and op-
pressed Namibian workers have

Training is a mere show and of
cosmetic nature As a result, most, if

With such a state of affairs, we the
Namibian workers are CDM, fate! that
we are not party tosuch acelebration.
We have nothing to celebrate.

To us the 50th birthday of Oranje.
mund is a reminder of 50 years of ex-
ploitation, overmining and oppreemon
of the Namibian people
