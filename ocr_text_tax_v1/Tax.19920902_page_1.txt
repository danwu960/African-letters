Mixed feelings

I WISH to react to the socal-
led Okahandja Doclaration
which was read to the audi-
ence who gathered at the All
Herero Cultural Memonal Day
in Okahandja recently.
While I wholeheartedly
support the cultural gather-
ing of that nature, I have re-
ceived the declaration with

mixed feelings hecause many
of those who claim to be
Sympathetic to the repatria-
tion do so in order to reap
massive harvests as they have
done in previous times. For
instance, the same messiahs
went to Botswana and col-
lected money and Lister en-
gines on the pretext that such
engines would be installed in
boreholes drilled for them by
the colonial administration in
Namibia and to date we do
not know the whereabouts of
these engines and the moncy
In addition some Batswana
nationals were accused of
having engaged lawyers in
order to block the repamia-
tion and hence each of those
who wanted to be repatnated
were asked to contribute a
specific amount so that they
could engage lawvers to ef-
fect their repatnation. From
the moncy collected, people
ennched themselves by pur-
chasing farms and buying
houses. I be beve vou will agroc
with me when I sav money 1s
collected. but notto the hene-
fit of those supposed to make
a living. An example is the
appeal made to Herero people
here and abroad to make
conations to build a decent
house for their paramount
chief. This received a posi
hive response but to date
Hereros hear that the house
was built by the colonial
administration with taxpay-
ers money which means the
house is a government house.
We have no legal claim to it
although we contnbuted

_ money to build it.

] want to send a strong appeal
to foreign mussions and the

Government of Namibia to
see to 1 that this illegal col-
lection of money and mate-
nal equipment by the socal-
led messiahs is brought to an
end with immediate effect.
Finally I appeal to the same
government and non goverm-
ment organisations to chan-
nel their assistance through a
body worked out by those who
want to be repatriated and that
body or association be regis

' tered and recognised by both
| Namibian and Botwana gov-

emments.
