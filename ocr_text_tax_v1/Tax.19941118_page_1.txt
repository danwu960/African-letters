Must faxpayers pay

for official’s

‘fondling’?

WOMEN'S Solidanty was shocked
to her that Mr Vero Mbahurua was
recently found guilty of sexual moles-
tation in Canada while representing
Namibia on an official visit. We were
even more hormfied to read tn The
Namibian of November 3 that Mr
Mbahurua was quoted as saying that
in his culture it is not an offence “to
fondle someone”. We would like to
make several points about this inci-
dent.

1. We often hear similar ‘cultural’
arguments applied to issues involving
women. There are ‘cultures’ in Na-
mibta which have endorsed racism in
the past but this is never accepted as an
argument for aquiescence to contin-
ued racism. By the same token, ‘cul-
tural’ beliefs are no argument for con-
tinucd sexism.

Furthermore, we wonder whose
‘culture’ Mr Mbahurua had in mind.
We suspect that ‘his culture’ means
the attitude of the men he knows,
because we know of no Namibian
women who agree to be treated as
sexual objects against their will.

2. Every ‘culture’ in Namibia ts
subject to the Namibian Constitution
and the laws of the land. Our Consti-
tution forbids sex and race discrimi-
nation and guarantees human dignity
to all persons, male and female, black
and white.

Article 19 ofour Constitution, which
covers cultural freedom, clearly states
that people in Namibia have cultural
freedom subject to the condition that
they do not violate the terms of the
Constitution or impinge upon the rights
of others,

Hf the incident. in question had taken
place in Namibia, we would have ad-
vised the woman to lay a criminal
charge of assault or indecent assault,
“Fondling” a woman without her con-
sentis justas much acrime in Namibia

as itis in Canada.

We hope that Government officials
do not think that they are exempt from
our Constituuon and our laws - no
matter what their ‘culture’, they are
Namibians and they have a duty to
obey our laws. Mr Mbahurua, as a
legal advisor, should know better.

3. According to the report in The
Namibian, Mr Mbahurua’s fine was
paid by the Commonwealth Parha-
mentarians’ Association and was re-
funded by the Namibian Government.
Why ts this? Was fondling a hotel
cleaner accepted as part of Mr
Mbahurua’s official duties? Are the
Namibian taxpayers expected to pay
for his disrespect for human dignity?

4. We would like to make a public
appeal to the Namibian Government to
take this incident very seriously. A
Government official travelling abroad
onofficial business represents Namibia
and everything Namibia stands for.
Women’s Solidarity would not like the
world to believe that Namibia is a
country where such behaviour is con-
doned or ignored.

We believe this offence calls for the
strongest public condemnation. We
also question whether a person who
shows such disregard for basic human
rights is worthy to act as a legal advi-
sor.

S. Finally we would like to applaud
the courage of the woman who laid the
charge against Mr Mbahurua in
Canada. It must nothave been easy for
a hotel worker to speak about against
such a prominent official, and we tind
this woman's example to be an inspira:
tion to us all,

We hope that the Government wall
keep the public informed about the
follow-up to this ugly incident.
