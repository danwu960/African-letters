ner

able Minister of Finance and

tis fellow members of the
National Assémbly do not pay
tax on their large incomes”’.

Members of the Cabinet and
National. Assembly are NOT
exempt from the payment of

income tax on their salanes

and fringe benefits, and this
statement by the Reverend
therefore has no substance. Only
a marginal portion of the sala-
ries of Cabinet members are
exempt from income tax, which
must be seen in the light of the
services they render in the
fulfilling of their duties and
ultimate responsibility to the
Republic of Namibia and its
people.

The letter by Mr Johan Pre-
torus from Keetmanshoop
states that he fully agrees with
the views of the Reverend Th-
tus and the above answer to the
letter by Rev Titus would there-
fore also apply. Mr Pretorius,
however, goes further and cnt-
cises the current income tax
system, mainly in respect of
the tranferability of abatements
between working spouses and
the lack of tax fences for those
taxpayers deriving mcome from
more than one trade.

The transferability of pn-
mary and children's abatements
must be seen as a compromise

between the system of com-
bined taxation and separate

taxation. Before March 1 1991
working marned women were
taxed on their income after
allowing anexemption of only
R1 000 while her husband
enjoyed the full married and
children’s abatements. The new
stem, whereby the married
anu children’s abatements are
divided equally in the case of
spouses earning taxable income
y from each other,
is therefore more in line with
Article 10 of the Constitution
of Namibia.
