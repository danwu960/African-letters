No Petrol
Problem,
It Seems!

JUST a short observation
by aconcemed citizen and
lax payer.

Fnday, 23.01.98,a white
Toyota Bakkic, licence
plate GRN 12338, Minis-
try of Agriculture, which
had a big additional petrol
tank on the back was park-
ing in Krupp Sueet and the
petrol out of this back-up
tank was pouring, not drip-
ping, outof the filling noz-
zle of this tank, because 1t
was standing in full sun.

Informing the staff and
visitors of the business, in
front of which the car was
Standing, most of the peo-
ple were not interested.
Except for one staff mem-
ber who went to inform
the driver, I received com-
ments like “They have
enough money ...”’

I was shocked by these
reactions: * Does every-
body feel the tax payers
money ts not worth sav-
ing? * Are the drivers of
government cars so un-
trained, that they do not
know the expansion of
petrol in sun heated tanks?

* Does care about the pol-
lution, which is the thing
that worried me in the first
place and why I stopped?
