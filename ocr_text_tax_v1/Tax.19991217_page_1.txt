Walvis Youth Vow
To Tackle Crime

IT 1S Christmas and crime ts incteasing every where
in Namibia. The coast is the target of the robbers and
those attacking other people.

The reason is, there is only one Police vehicle to
assist about 5 000 people of Walvis Bay. The rest
have been damaged and in accidents. The Govern-
ment vehicles which have been in the country for
barely three years have been destroyed. Officials
are destroying whats purchased with our our tax
money, the violence ts increasing and we are with-
out transport

A week ago four men attacked an clderly person
in Walvis Bay) Three days after that a certain
businessman in Kuisebmond was assaulted in his
house The worstof alls that the Police renders bad
Service

The youth will not allow the elderly. bustnesses
and other people to be attacked in the streets tor
nothing. We, the youth, will take the law in ourown
hands and we will hit buck hard

We are directing a friendly request to the Govern-
ment, Police Commuisstoner and the Mayor, Mrs
Samaria, in Walvis Bay: stop the violence in Walvis
Bay, we are not atraid of tighting back, we are just
brought up well.

Every weekend someone 1s assaulted. We think
the Police station commander at Kutsebmond should
do something about that.

The only people who stop crime at Walvis Bay
are “Community against Crime’. Magnificent, guys.
we are proud of you. Mrs Samaria, bring more
vehicles and English-speaking Police to the police
stations so that we can just understand each other.

Unhappy Youth
WALVIS BAY
