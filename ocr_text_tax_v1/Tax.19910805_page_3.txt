_ Article 10 of the Constitution
of Namibia.

Mr Johan Pretorius criticises
the present situation whereby
individuals having two or more
trades can, in some cases, off-
set business losses against their
salary income. It seems that
Mr Pretonus is in favour of a
system of socalled ‘‘tax-fenc-
ing’’. The introduction of such
a system will obviously neces-
sitate drastic statutory amend-
ments. Suffice it to say that
such a system will in general
lead to unjustifiable interfer-
ence with private enterprise
and the economic effects of
this could be more harmful
than those of the present sys-
tem. Mr Pretorius’ concems,
however, are noted.

To conclude, as was indi-
cated by the Honourable Min-
ister of Finance, Dr Otto
Hernigel, during his main
Budget speech this year, the
administration of taxation in
Namibia will be decentralised
in the very near future, so that
those Namibians living and
working in the south, will be
_ Drought ‘closer’ to Windhoek,
facilitating the process of
communication.
