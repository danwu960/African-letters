‘Time To Account’

THROUGHOUT the country I have
witnessed growing poverty and hun-
ger. This is an unacceptable state of
affairs for a country with only close
to two million people, but nich with
natural resources and raw matenials.
The past year has seen alarming in-
creases inthe prices of food. clothing
and fuel.
The poor and needy people should
not be only be fed dunng festivals,
Chnstmas gatherings or at one or
other occasion. Thts process must be
done ona regular basis. In fact there
1s no sense in feeding a hungry per-
son only for one day
One major concern in this inde-

tron campaigns the politteal ottice
bearers fisty bureation high on their
campaign promises, but from the
looks of it this is forge tten
Sadly. in the past scar unemplos
ment has continued to escalate and
matriculants struggle to enrol for
further studies and our graduates and
skilled professionals flock out of the
country and the already jobless have
lost hope of ever earning a decent
living wage
The health sectorin general ts also

little or no stock.

AIDS is killing and destroying
mostly the poor and the Government
must make this a priority and not a
favour. Rape, murder and robbery is a
growing trend in this beautiful coun-
ty. Itis shameful to see the names of
top political bearers, as well as top
Government officials involved in the
committing of crimes.

The robbery of innocent Namibians
and tourists must by all means be
stopped and culprits be brought to
book.

The Police as well as Government
vehicles must only be used for the
practical purpose they are assigned

Linally. the exploiting and wast-
aec oof taxpayers money must be
stopped Itis shameful to see thatonly

tion ves in luxury while the remain:

Wee trusted scu.our polincal office
bearers and top gosernment officials

to look afler Our precious resources
and money, not for you to enrich your-
selves and become fat cats. You will
have to account one or other ime
Remember weare very concerned and
frustrated.
