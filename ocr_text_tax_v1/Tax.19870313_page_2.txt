Cabinet minister can simply accept
serious allegations without further
verification. Mr Shipanga’s failure to
check his facta is even more frighten-
ing in view of the extremely wide ar-
bitrary executive powers which are
vested in him. and his colleagues in
the Cabinet of the interim govern-
ment by virtue of numerous socall-
ed security laws, which would clear-
ly require the greatest measure of —
restraint and responsibility. These
laws not only offend against fun.
damental human rights, but alsoin- |
vite serious abuses of due process and |
the Rule of Law. .

It is most disturbing that Mr
Shipanga, at the taxpayer's expense,
and protected by a statutory immuni-
ty against possible legal action,
repeats unchecked allegations by an
obecure letter writer and then, on the
basis of those slanderous allegations
proceeds to ‘sharply’ criticise a senior
and respected Priest of the order of
the Oblates whose dedication
towards the protection of Christian
values in this territory can hardly be |
questioned. !

Mr Shipanga has chosen Father |
Nordkamp as a target of severe |
criticism. At the same time Mr |
Shipanga however chooses to remain
silent about the Police’s admission
under oath in the Heita trial present-
ly before the Windhoek Supreme
Court, presenting a picture of brutal
violations of the most elementary
human rights and an alarming
disregard for law and order by the
police. : -

In view of the aforesaid, this order
wishes to record its strongest objec: |
tion to Mr Shipanga’s criticiam of |
Father Bernhard Nordkamp.
