my conscience that] write to
yOur paper in an attempt to
unburden myself. The actions
and policy of the Windhoek
City Council overthe last few
months have brought into
serious disrepute the integ-
rity and the humanity of the
poheymakers [see the eves
of the mothers and children
and | cannot held but weep
with anger and sadness at the
cruelty of this Council

This same Council that has
the audacity to use public
funds to subsidise the water
and electricity supply to mas-
sive companies lke Ramatex
and to grant them land tor
tree. this same Council 1s
leading the attack on the poor
in the name of tull cost-re-
covery. Not even the apart-
hed Boers in power ever
imagined charging full cost
for basic water services, but
these our supposed leaders
have the audacity to force
this brutal policy onto an al-
ready impoverished people

We have lately witnessed
the escalating tendency of

Call For Poor To Seize Power

ally undermining the immu-
mty ofourcommunities The
greatest challenge for those
who sull have the power to
fight back, 19 firstly to define
our enemy and to resist them

Up unl now, these battles
in the community have been
fought by the elderly, on their
own, with others looking on
as if they are not affected by
water andelectncity cut-offs
Butitis no longer possible to
temain silent on these issues,
for itis the very stuff of life
and history To do nothing
and he down ata tme like
this, would be a betrayal of
our most vital interests

The enemies of the poor
are charging inflated prices
for water and when people
are unable to pay, given the
economic condinon of the
masses. then Council cuts off
our water supply Such cru-
elty and naked barbarism
goes unveiled in Windhoek’s
upper chambers. They are
attempting to tum water into
acommoadity for profitand in
so doing, they are depriving
us of our most natural rehts,
invluding the ght to exsst
They are throwing women
andchildren from their homes
and threatening the weak und
vulnerable with moiletary
might Anything except mas-
sive Social resistance at this
porntin ime would be sheer
cowardice

Water cutotts are uneon-

sttutional and hostile to our
human rights. Using water as
a source of profit ts but an-
other way to force the poor to
pay for the excesses of the
nich. The water and land sup-

paid for by the poorest of the

income from us, the poor and
impovenshed people who are
made to pay twice over for the
cruel and profit-onented policy
of the privatisers, the bureau-
crats, the lying and stealing
politicians and their agents
The war against the poor 1s
reaching a new peak and in
this war the poor and uop-
pressed people from town and
country, who have suffered
unspeakable horrors as a re-
sult of the privatisation of
water andelectricity services,
are the greatest threat to the
Council. The Municipality.
in cahoots with the
privatisers. began a serious
attack on the poor, by forcing
people - even pensioners - to
pay high prices for basic serv-
ices. They are attempting to
squeeze blood from a rock
The Municipal Council. in
blindly ignoring the real con-
ditions and needs of the
Masses Of amMpoverished pea-
ple and attacking us, has made
itself into an enemy of the
poor It deserves to be called
that. for that is what itis. and

Now itis time for the champi-
ons of the poor to rise up, to
organise

There will be no greater
Justification for the downfall
and overthrow of the Council
and its backers, no greater
stimulus to socsal revolution,
than the current policy of
Council This policy, in es-
sence, 1s to deprive the poor
people of water and sanita-
tion, of land and of the jobs to
sustain ourselves. The policy
of evictions, of water and
electricity cut-offs is above
all hostile to the needs of our
innocent children, who are
always the most vulnerable
to these attacks from the
Council. Water cut-offs are
unconstitutional and a viola-
tion of basic nghts and must
be declared to be so

Since Council has made a
policy of depriving and si-
lently killing the poor by de-
priving us of our basic nghts,
so (oO It justifies its own
downfall and overthrow at
the hands of the downtrod-
den mass of humanity - thatit

taken its side. and will suffer

Its necessary historical fate at
the hands of those they sought
to crush.

As working class families,
we must reject water cut-offs
as threat to human life and
dignity We must fight for
the scrapping of the water

We must revitalise our forces

Government is attempting
to denounce its responsibil-
ity to provide water and en-
ergy. basic services. Its new
role, which it has fashioned
for itself. is simply to collect
taxes and to use ily repressive
