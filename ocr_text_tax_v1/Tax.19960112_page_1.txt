| Ombudsman Challenged On Environment

PERMIE me space in vour newspaper to address
the Onbudsman, the supposed upholder of our
Constitution in respect of Natural Resources,

Sir,

After returning froma ten day holiday at the
coast, Lam of the opinion that you are not doing
your job, or rather, you are neglecting your
duties.

Let me be specific:

1. Damaging the Environment

When travelling between Okahandja and
Karibib, one cannot help noticing one heap after
the other of concrete boulders. ONE HEAP AF-
TER THE OTHER of unsightly rubble. Nobody
debates the necessity of building a fibreoptic line
to the coast for better communication.

Surely this is no excuse for destroying a besu-
tiful countryside with unsightly rubble.

I have taken time to investivate - near the
railway lines there are enough borrow pits of past

construction that serve no purpose.

With aloader and a truck, these heaps could be
removed and the holes filled - a dual purpose
served.

2 Empty bottles and bags

Travelling along the highways, one sees end-
less heaps of plass bottles, 99 per cent of them
non-returnable tin the desert we found only 4
returnable bottles, which we collected). Why is it
NOY possible to promulpate a law, making all
non-returnable fluid containers legal, or atleast
place a heavy tax on all these glass and plastic
containers.

It seems as if all partics concerned shun their
responsibility - firstly, the firm that is marketing
the product, secondly, the lezislator who is well
aware of the negligent attitude of the population
at large, thirdly, the Ombudsman who ls ulti-
mately responsible for the environment and
fourthly, cach and every member of the populu-
tion.

YVake time to look at the legislation of our so
often shunned neighbours and try to estabish

why their countryside is reasonably clean
Sir,

PLEASE DO SOMETHING
CONCERNED WINDHOEK
