Ministers, take note

IT SEEMS the Ministers of our
newly -independent country have
forgotten who has put them in gov-
ernment.

As reported in The Namibian (Fnday
Apmil 6 1990) they will receive huge
salaries of around R12 500 a month.

Our country has gone through a
long struggle. The people have
struggled together, workers and stu-
dents have really sacnficed, our PLAN
combatants have given up their edu-
cation and lives to serve (for no sal-
ary ) the motherland - but it seems our
Ministers have forgotten.

Some ex-combatants have not yet
acquired jobs. Many have lost their
families and have no one to suppor
them. Our education system has to
continue to support racists and auto-
crats who now pretend to have changed
so as to retain their jobs, all for the
sake of reconciliation. Is’ ‘reconcill-
ation’’ the reason for these high sala-
nes?

It seems that we are not only
“reconciling’’ with ex-colomal
masters, we have a goverment which
wants to mould itself according to
them. Our leaders preached equ ality,

| elitism prior to independence.
_ocialism was compromised to mixed —
economy. Does compromuse mean
“throw equality on the rubbish heap’”?

Even the colonial masters and its
stooges were never paid such incred-
iple salaries. The foundation for a
new Namibia cannot be laid thus.
Before you raise your salarics, Min-
‘sters, raise those of the workers.
Remember that you pay forno taxes,
housing, transport etc. Are our taxed
based on underpaid salanes to pay
for you to get rich?

We cannot grant you the right to
forget the struggling masses.

Workers and trade unions should
voice their grievances as we did aginst
the Pretoria regime and its slooges.
Are we to somain silent due lo affili-

ations?
