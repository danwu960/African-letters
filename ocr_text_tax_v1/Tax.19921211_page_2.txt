radical’ Swapos and a forney
detainee. For a moment they
remember the past, you know
those old days, and lock in a
warm embrace.

Then, usually the former de-
tainee becomes bitter and the
Swapo looks down or starts
crying in despair.

There were and are still many
such episodes. During such
times, the sympathisers of the
ex-detainees ask in wonder how
1s it possible you can embrace
your tormentor. I am sure the
Shoyes in turn ask the com-
rades how he/she dare embrace
a ‘spy’. Those who were not
there will not understand many
things.

Certainly it must be mind-
boggling to Shoye how those
very ‘traitors’ are allowed to
occupy top positions in gov-
ermment and how they are

There is no such thing as

two very persistent persons
fighting. They fight and fight
and never listen to reason as
each hopes to deliver the final
knockout blow.

Naturally exhaustion sets in
and each realises a knockout is
wishful thinking. At that stage

' | the simplest gesture can stop
the fight and the two will never
again be the same. For one,
they start to respect each other,
then they tolerate each other.

Reconciliation, on the other

meaning and essence of exis-
tence. A proponent of such a
concept is no longer able to
hate.

In the Swapo detainee saga,
the organisation still fails to
say sorry. They refuse to talk
