THANK you for your column “Politi-
cal Perspecuve™ ot Friday Februar 4.

Thave been acivil servant for the past
eight years. Sometimes one feels so
down just at the thought that crvil serv-
ants do not get any increase or even a
bonus. We live far beneath the bread
line because of debts and no one thinks
of giving us an extra cheque to clear our
debts. We have to buy everything on
credit to try and survive because there
is Never any cash available.

As civil servants, we have only one
form of income and if we want to do
other business we first have to get per-
mission from the public service, and
then this income is also taxed IT gota
Wascom cheque of about NS9 000 last
year which was taxed to N$4.000. Why
can’t they tax these big cheques of the
leaders? This 1s very unfair toward the
ordinary worker.

You work for a month and at the end
of it, youdon’tevenhaveenough money
to pay your debts. Some days you don’t
even have money for a loaf of bread or
to pay the taxi to come to work. Some-
times people can no longer bear the

The Civil Servant And
The Gravy Train

suttering of their children.

The wealthy leaders of this country
should keep in mind that these are some
of the reasons why some people com-
mut suicide.

The pnce of everything tn life in-
creases: taxis, bread, milk. The one
thing that does not increase is the civil
servant's salary

When will the Prime Minister, hes
deputy. other ministers and deputy min-
isters, and the MPs campaign for an
increase tn our salaries and even a bo-
nus? Never, because they do not care, as
long as thetr gravy train cuns smoothts

Please vour honourables, start think
ingabout vourteliow Namibian s Please
don’ ttellusevery time thatitis notonls
the Government 5 duty tohelp We ty
to help ourselves, but how can we tf our
salaries stay the same from year to year.
We try tobe efficient and effective civil
servants, but the Government does noth-
ing from its side to encourage their
workers.
