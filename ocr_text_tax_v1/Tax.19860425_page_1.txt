Colonel Eimbeck reacts to opinions of Pastor Kameeta

YOU HAVE GIVEN Vice Bishop
Kameeta space in your newspaper to
voice his opinion. I request thesame
opportunity since you call yourself
achampion for freedom of specch.

Mr Kameeta claims that the in-
dependence of Namibia is an in-
alienableright, and that it isdemand-
ed without conditions attached. He
isright, but why does he, and his par-
ty, Swapo, refuse to acknowledge any
other political opinion in this de-
mand for independence?

Why doesn't Mr Kameeta use his
high office to ensure justice, peace
and freedom for every Namibian?
He is aware of the fact that Swapo
does not tolerate opposition. He
knows that everybody opposing
Swapo will be subject to arbitrary
punishment or even execution
without a fair trial. Mr Kameeta
should support the call made by The
Namibian on Swapo toensurea fair
hearing for those who are accused of
being spies for South Africa.

Mc Kameeta should be aware of
the fact that many political parties in
Nainibia have urged Swapoto be an
equal partner in their opposition to
South Africa. He should also know
that Swapo refuses to drop the adjec-

tive ‘sole and authentic represen.
tative of the people of Namibia’. Ms
Lister should inform Mr Kameeta of
what her experiences are concerning
this imposed status on Swapo. Mr
Kameeta, who has vowed to preach
love, peace and righteousness,
should bein the front to ensure that
every Namibia be granted the right
and the opportunity to work towards
independence of this country,

Mr Kameeta knows that Swapo
regards violence as the only viable
means of attaining independence tor
Namibia, but does he consider the
fact that the majority people inthis
country are peaceloving Christians
and thus prefer a negotiated
setdement?

Mr Kamecta calls for boycotts and
disinvestment and calls the potential
suffering of the majority of people
‘empty phrases’. Simultaneously this
Vice Bishop demands that ‘all peo-
ple must have the right to decent
housing, and bring up their famulics
incomfort and secunty. Free medical
care and hospitalisation must be pro-
vided for all, with special care for
senior citizens, mothers and small
children. The aged and disabled must
be fully cared for by the State’.

Has it occurred to Mr Kameeta
that toreign investment is vital to
achieve these aims? Mr Kameeta 1s
fully aware of the fact that Swapo
and the CCN regularly call on inter-
national financial support to
alleviate the plight of the people.
Why then should only his party and
Ws followers benefit from financial
aid and not the majority of the
people?

Will Mr Kameeta care to tell the
public how much he earns and how
much he pays in taxes? Will Mr
Kaniceta be prepared Co inform the
people ot this country about the
lnfestyde of those who profess to fight
tor independence and lberation
about their contribution towards the
alleviation of the suffering people in
the form of finangial contributions?

Can Mr Kamectainform the publicol

what he proposes should be dane to
obtain sufficient funds to attain what
all the people in Namibia desire?
Mr contention as that Swapo ts
guilty of the most atrocious
discrimination against people. Mr
Kameeta 1s actively engaged in
Swapo's political activities, this
makes him guilty of discriminating
aguinst his own people too. Accor-

ding to the Oxford dictionary,
discrimination means to ‘make a
distinction, to give unfair treatment,
especially because of prejudice’.
Swapo and Mr Kameeta call
everybody who does not compty with
their conditions and with their opi-
mons, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pets etc. Everybody who dares to
speak against Swapo is threatened
and intimidated. Every person who
docs not support Swapo is being
discriminated against. This 1s
definitely not what the majority of
Namibians willsupport, thisis what
the majoruyof the Namibians want
eradicated,

Mr Kameeta claims his fame and
right to speak about pohtical matters
on his arrestand detention. For any
law-abiding citizen, especaally for
devoted Christians, defiance of the
law isdetestable. If Mr Kamectaasa
Vice Bishop and even more as a
Swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
ahenable right to self-determunation,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not support an
organisation which sees only
violence as a means of achieving

whal they desire, namely, to take over
power of this country.

Mr Nujoma has declared more
than once that Swapo is not in-
terested in powersharing, but only in
power itself, During his recent pro-
paganda tour for Swapoin West Ger-
many, Mr Kameeta has proven that
he is against any form of opposition
to Swapo and that he disputes the
right of ficedom of speech of a Ger-
man citizen in his own country. With
this act added to his political antics
against the people of thiscountry, Mr
Kameeta has disqualified himself of
claiming to be i champion for
freedom, Justice and peace.
