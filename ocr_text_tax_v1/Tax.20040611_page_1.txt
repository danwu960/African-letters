Oshakati/Ongwediwa Are One Town

ALLOW me space in your
esteemed daily. There has
been disturbing talk and
often exaggerated com-
parision of two northern
towns, Onegwediva and
Oshakatt. It is on record
that Ongwediva is clean
and well-managed and
one couldn't agree more.
But comparing the two
in terms of cleanliness
IS pretty much unfatr.
As far as Lam concerned
Onewedivais by and large
aresidential districtrather
than a metropolitan town
like Oshakatr. Infact there
are fewer industrial and
business activities tak-
Ing place at Onewediva
than at Oshakat. To give
an example, Onewediva

has its own open market
where only a few do their
business. Again a size-
able number of working
people residing tn Ong-
wediva either work in
Oshakatl, Ondangwa or
in the surrounding towns
and villages, Ongwediva
included, conduct their
business and do their
shopping. In essence,
masses of Ongwediva
residents also do con-
tribute to the unhy gienic
conditions in Oshakats if
there ts any,
Justimagine how much
of a burden to the Os-
hakaul town council to
provide cleaning services
to the masses who do not

even pay rates and taves

to Oshakati Municipal-
ity. The odds are that
some people may seek
to score cheap political
points by comparing an
apple to a lemon. One
wonders what Ongwediva
would become without
Oshakat.

In fact Ongwediva is
more like one of Os-
hakatiâ€™s suburbs and one
would think that these
ivo towns have a unified
cleaning system, Instead
of competing they must
forge mutual co-opera-
tion, because to me Ong-
wediva and Oshakatt ts
just one big town.
