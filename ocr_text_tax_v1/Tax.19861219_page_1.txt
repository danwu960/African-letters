en challenge

WE, 1
- Gebiet, have kept a close eye on the
maelstrom politics of the Basters
recently, and we are sick and tired
to this underhand, directionless
politicking over our heads - we
challenge the Basters to direct
negotiate with us.

We wish to inform the Baster
government that we have serious
reservations about the statements in
recent weeks.

Firstly, about the socalled ‘open
schools’. In spite of the Baster
government's eelf-expressed policy
that all schools in the Gebiet are open
to all regardless of race or colour, it
is not the Baster children who are be-
ing driven out of these ‘open schools’
- at a time when the whole of
Namibia is striving for open schools.

Money from Baster taxpayers. We
would like to know which Baster tax
payments are spent on what purpose

for the black people of Rehoboth. For
virtually every need, such as the
moving of black people, they got
money from the central government,
but instead used it for the develop.
ment of the Basters and in so doing,
perpetrating the squatter status of
the black people in the area.

On the question of the presence of
black people in this Gebiet, which is

wrongly understood, | would like to
say the following: we are in this
Gebjet to stay, forever. It is our right
to be here, it ia not a favour from the

of anyone else. The Basters

once again take note that the
present Rehoboth history is being
written by the Bastera for the

Basters, and is not recognised y US. .
, Basters should also take note that.

‘we first requested fair and

THE black people of Rehoboth —

for each black resident of this area,
in order to ‘squat’ legally in these
places, but we are no longer in-
terested in a few hectares: we want
the land of our forefathers.

The socalled support of the black
people. We would like to see the
Baster government hold a meeting in
Block E in order to establish what
the black people think of them.

The referendum. Like other Nami-
bians, we look forward to the result
of the proposed referendum, because
in this manner we wil] get a clear pic-
ture of where the Basters stand in
regard to the rest of Namibia. We ex-
pect the whole world to keep an eagle
eye on the proposed referendum.

The Basters of this country must
take note that any law applied in the
Rehoboth Gebiet, must be announc-
ed at a policy meeting, where they
establish what policy should be
followed and that everyone is guilty
of the socalled vaderlike wette and at-
tention 18 given to the official oppres-
sion of the Basters, under which the
black people suffer.

‘With the proposed referendum
each Baster wil! be asked what his
attitude is towards the other in-
habitants of this country.

One thing is certain - as certain as
the sun which rises in the east - an
election will come in this country,
and the Basters will want to
negotiate.
