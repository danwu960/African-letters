Provoke Reactions |

AFTER receiving My tax invoice for
the period ended 15 July, Inotuwed that
you {Mumicipality] have charged mean
amount of N$103,22 for “Open space
and street cleaning”. Before Lome into
this matter, I waited for the response to
the various quenes directed to you via
the media and other instances But what
a farce this turned out to be.

The explanavions oftered by your Mr
Nghinamwaamt were so absurd and
ndiculous, that Iam left with no other
alternative but to direct this matter di-
rectly to you [Municipality |

My total assessment rates tor the
period ended June 15 2003 amounted to
N$350,43, which amount included the
so-called OSSC charves, if vour Mr
Nehinamwaamt is to be beheved. The
amount for the penod ended July 1S
2003 1s NS$473.74, an increase of
NS$123.31 or 35.18%. To top itall, the
new property valuations are notevenin
force yet.

I know that in Namibia today, many
people are being regarded and labelled
as baboons, but, my dear Sir, this
baboon knows when itis taken for ande
or being ripped off. Awareness-rais-
ing! Do not make me laugh. You people
underestimate the intelligence of your
town’s inhabitants. Why can you not
stand up for your mistakes instead of
making them even worse by trying to
Justify and excusing your faulty deci-
sions with inaccuracies and remarks
like “transparency “ etc. Windhoek is
becoming a damn unattractive town to

invest in, contrary to what you always
trumpet in the newspapers.

But knowing the stubborness of you
and your Council and the fact that you
will not listen to or take notice of the

iva me ea een a ts mater
have always h ie soon isles

. After your officials have now made me

Plyinyg for the open space cleaning all the
time while wasting my time and petrol to
keep the same open spaces clean, Thave
Now decided to dump my weekly garden

After all, lam paying you people tor just
that This will negate the effect of the
35.18 per centincrease a little bit. Please
do not say to me that this 1s legal, as
your charge for this service would then
also be deemed illegal. Furthermore, any
clgarette and/or cool drink tin wall from
now on be dumped onto the streets from
my car, as I am also paying tor the
cleaning thereof.

I must after all get something out of
something that I pay for. [just wanted to
let you know of my transparent decision.
You will probably argue that this ts a
stupid reacuon, but let me tell you the law
according to Newton: “For every action
there is an equal but opposite reaction”.
Think about that for a while. If you peo-
ple want to improve your Council's bank
accounts, I would advise you to stop
financing useless insututions and bodies

like the Khomas Regional Council. The
only productive act they and Mr. Pandem
have performed to date is when they have
to travel to your offices to collect the
monthly finances needed for their lavish

lifestyles.
