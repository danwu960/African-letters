More in rentals

MR NORA Chase was reported in
The Namibian of May 30 1986 as say-
ing that the residents of Katutura
alone pay more in rents than Ross-
ing pays in taxes. On June 4 1986 she
was reported elsewhere as saying
that Rossing pays only R50 (per year)
for the use of the land on which it
mines.

Ms Chase has been misinformed. In
fact the residents of Katutura have
paid a total of between R830 000 and
R900 000 per vear in rentals for the
past three years; during the same
period Rossingâ€™s taxes have
amounted to hundreds of millions of
Rand.

The grant fee paid bv Rossing Mine
is R13 160 per vear, not R50.

These facts can be readily confirm-
ed by the relevant authorities.
