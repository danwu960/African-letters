edges the right of every
individual, enshrined io
the constinstion of the
Republic of Namibta, to
express his or her demo-
cratic views. Any reac-
tion to a letter in a news-

ishowever impossible to
react fully to a letter of
Mr KR Sievers, with the
heading ‘Outdated privi-
lege’ which appeared in
your September 3 edi-
tron, in order to set the

record straight.

Most of Mr Sievers’
allegations, targetted at
the commercial farmers,
would necessitate factual
clarifications and expla-
nations, which your
newspaper would not
have enough space for.

Let us focus on the is-
mercial farmers have no
real reason for complaint
about the new book value

the privileged position of
the past, the commercial
farmer sull has a crucial
and very important role
to play in the Namibian

The NAU, as the rep-

majority of commercial
farmers as well as some
communal farmers, com-

a mission statement of
the union.

Its actions since inde-
pendence and before
speak of a positive com-
mitment towards the
country and its people. It
certainly does not want
locvade its responsibili-
tes, like paying taxes.

Atits annual congress
in August the NAU ac-
cepted the principle that
livestock values should
be adjusted and that ag-
ticulture should be
treated equally to other
sectors. The congress
however felt that the
unique situauon of the
farmer (commercial as
well as communal)
should be taken inlocon-
sideration and that only
realised profits should be
taxed.

Can you expect farm-
crs, who made no profits
due tu the drought situa-
tion, to pay taxes on the
increased livestock val-
ues and still survive?
Also, what about their
dependents, those who
have worked on their
farms for years? If the
concerned farmers hav:
noincome, who will car4
for their farm wockers?
Remember, agriculture
is one of the biggest em-
ployces.

The congress also de-
cided that the NAU
should negotiate with
government about the
equalisation system re-
garding agronomy farm-
