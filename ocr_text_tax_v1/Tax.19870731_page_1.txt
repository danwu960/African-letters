On ‘Bothacracy’

IN RESPONSE to Mr Veripi Mungun.
da'sidlotalkain The Namibinn of Ju.
ly 10 on the topic ‘Coward Lister’, I
would like to point out the following:
1. Lister - nationality and
patriotiam: | feel it is Ma Listor’s full
right toexpresa horself against thein-
justices and brutalities conducted
against the Namibian national, ir-
reapective of where sho waa born. She
ina more credible Namibianthan you,
who are selling out your nation, your
country and its natural resources. She
payataxesaanall Namibians do, andin
addition, contributes actively to bring:
ing about of peace and stability to
Namibia, while you keep yourself
tribalistic and passive. Beloved Lister,
keep on, every good work deserves a
reward.
2.0P0 -SWAPO- an Ovambo par-
ty: OPO has not existed fora longtime
It has been the South West Africa Peo.
ple’s Organisation, SwapoofNamubia,
for alony time. How dare youcallitan
Ovambo party, although itiaa Nam.
bian national political movement?
3.CCN- priests, puppets Shame on
you, Munyunda. Phese people repre:
sent the Namibian nation (the Coun.
elofChurchesin Namibia) They are
renowned for fighting for peace, juatice
and liberty, and committing
themselves to the spiritual care of all
Christians
4. Swapo generals- where are they?
Swapo hus been willing to sign an ar
mistice with the Pretoria regime and
latter has failed to agree toit. And now,
Mr Mungunda? Swapo did not glorify
war, but was forced to tuke up arms
against those you praise.
& NCU - a truly Christian body
Could atraly Christian body request
the dismantling of its own nations
refiigee camps’? Camps where Chris:
tian Namibians reside? Who do they
think will house Namilnaos fleeing
fromthe racial lawsinthiscountry? Do
they think itss@easy toKtay outside the
country without proper supervision
and do they think it is easy to provide
such supervision there?
I finally wish tocondemn Voripiand
his puppet structure for:
Ci claiming that apartheld laws are
dead in Namibia;
[> requesting pre-independence
development aid and recognition ofthe
interim »y‘erninent internationally,
oupiprting the unelected,
unrepre.zvitative socalled interim
government,
afMfilating toanethnic bused party

legitiminings SAy presence in
Namibia by being part of reachlonaty
forces such as Etango, Swapol, owatl
baleocondemia the duterim poyern

papanda of pidectrination and
dincrediting, feaapo oo th cur Cus
rnonies ‘Phew urge Precoriiaes forces to
‘exterminate Svoupy and ‘hae then
harder’ which vutomaticnlly sases
peopl to leave the country. }
We have nuver been deceived by
Vorster's regime nor will we be decelv:
ed by Bothacracy. Remember thut,
