Therefore the question
1s what is more important
in your opinion Swapo
Elders, Mr List. and
Nanso?

1) Changing the constt-
tution to allow continued
presidency for Mr
Nujoma for rather dog-
matic reasons. of

2) Changing the consti-
tution to redress issues
affecting our daily lives
and that of the future
black generations: oF

3) The former on con-
dition that the latter Is
guaranteed?

As the debate continues.

please Iet us qualify tan-
gibly why we support oF
do not support the amend:
ment of the constitution.
