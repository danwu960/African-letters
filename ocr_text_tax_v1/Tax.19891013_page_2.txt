then does it mean if the Academy
stays in town, and grows larger?

A further question is the Teachers
Training College. Everybody knows
it is under utilised and has fantastic
sports facilities. Can this country really
afford to spend taxpayers moncy (most
of the Academy funding 1s taxpayers
money) to duplicate facilities? This
is nonsense.

We are not opposed, out of prin-
ciple, but as residents we are Op-
posed to intervarsily (sports events),
traffic chaos and noise, floodlights
and cheering crowds in a residential
area.

Please help us to get clearcut an-
swers in this matter from the City Â©
Council.

would reply to these pertinent
