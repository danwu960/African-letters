Dear Mr Cleary

YOU too have done some ‘remarkable’
pieces of writing, most recently in
Leadership (Volume $ 1986 Number 2),
in which you measure the success of ihe
interim government by means of the
vague generaltsation of ‘inclusivity’.
This ‘government’, you say, seeks to in-
volve all parties and also to draw to
these same parties, the support
previously enjoyed by those outside it.

May we remind you that there are six
parties (some in name only) which en-
joy membership of the interim govern-
ment. Membership of ‘other parties’,
however minor their support, who have
shown interest in the interim govern-
ment, has been turned down, and I refer
in particular to the recent HNP request
for membership of the ‘Constitutional
Council’.

‘Inclusivity’, therefore, hardly seems
to be the goal of this interim
government,

You have not explained why the DTA
prefers to operate outside your con-
sultancy service, and it has been wide-
ly reported (not only in The Namibian)
that there has been a breakdown in
communication between yourself and
Mr Dirk Mudge, an interim government
miniMer you claim to represent,

What is perhaps of note, is your
— geference to the ‘Transitional Govern-

| ment’, rather than the ‘Government of

National Unity’, Even you can no-

longer claim that there is “unity” in their
ranks, any more than you can claim that
there is ‘consensus’ on the question of
AG 86 despite socalled mnanimnous

resolutions concerning the removal of —

ethnic and racial discrimination.

As to ‘marketing the truth’, I believe
bia does: just that ‘

whereas you are spending a lot of tax-
payer's money on marketing what !
believe is a myth - mamely, that an in-

terim government such as we have at

~ present, can never engendé r the support

of the people of this country as a whole.

We will continue to ‘market’ what we,
