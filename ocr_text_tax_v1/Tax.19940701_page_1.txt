Gambling Is A Matter Of Concern

Ment is pernicious in its
ultimate effect and cre-
ates a false sense of so-
Cial responsibility.

It is my considered
view that, in a country
like Namibia, no useful
purpose could be
achieved by the institu-
tion of state-run or regu-
lated gambling.

There is substantial
evidence from other
countries toindicate that
contro] by regulation
does not prevent exploi-
tation by the criminal
element. Instead there

velop poor attitudes to-

tion, | contend that Ie-
galised gambling
through lotteries will not
stop illegal sales of for-
eign sweepstake tickets
or fraudulent lotteries.
Conducting the lotteries
under government aus-
pices will not avoid this
danger cither.

Having followed the
debate on gambling,
there is an illusion that
financial retums from
lotteries and other forms
of gambling will provide
a much-needed source
forrevenue. The fact that

forlegalisation of lotter-
ies. An unenlightened
majority will Most prob-
ably be wrong, especially
when it ignores the ex-
perience of history. Fur-
thermore, itcan be read-
ily demonstrated that lot-
teries are an uneconomi-
cal way to raise money.
A good example can be
obtained from Ireland.
The total income from
the Irish hospitals from
the Irish sweepstakes,
counting all money now
gathered in Canada, the
US, Britain and else-
where, amounts to about
four million dollars a
year. This is less than
the 19 per cent of the
money paid by those who

The legalisation of the
institution of gambling
weakens the basic
premise of the good so-
ciety, namely the Chris-
tian and humanitarian
conceptof social respon-
sibility for one’s neigh-
bour.

Namibia being a pre-
dominantly Christian
community, I believe it
is a Christian duty to
take unto one’s self the
need for one'sneighbour
instead of taking from
him.

The fact is that often
those people whoengage
in gambling are those

who are least able'to af-.

The commandment.
