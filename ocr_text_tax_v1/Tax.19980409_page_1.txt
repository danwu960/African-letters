The DTA Takes
Issue With ‘Laz’

J REFER to the column “Ekse Kuume™ by
Nehumbilemo ya Ndakomantin The Namibian of
Fnday, Apmt 3, 1998
Asthiscolummn is probably read by many people |
cannot allow the writer to getaway with his unin-
formed remarks about the issuc such as cutting down
the Civil Semice Why does he feel that the opposi-
ton “are dying aslow, painful and ndiculous death?”
ltas ume people hke this columnist stop making such
unfounded and groundless remarks about the oppo
siuon when they clearly know nothing about whatis
happening in the polities of Namibia
The wnier goes on to tot out the hairy old argu:
ment about the opposition only knowing how to
cntucise but never providing any altematives. Allthis
serves to prove is that the wnter never reads hisown
or any other newspaper. The official opposition, the
DTA of Namibia, has provided plenty of alternatives
to, for example, the shocking overspending by the
government, the enormous size of the Cabinet, how
to solve the lands issue, and many other important
issues, but the writer clearly finds iLeasier just to go
along with the stream than to think for himself and
inform himself of what those altematives are.

This is shown by his infantile argument about why
the Civil Service should not be downsized. Where
does he think the money comes from to pay all those
civil servants? This is not a Socialist welfare state
where no one pays taxes and the state employs
everyone until the state is bankrupt. The taxpayers of
Namibia must provide the money to pay all the civil
servants, and there 1s not cnough moncy in Namibia

to support the civil ser tee
Only tthe government stops spending the tar pay-
cr money on unnecessan luxunes and produces a
Budeet which will stimulate the co anomy and boost
job creation will the people about whem the column:
ist chums to be concemed stop sutfenng. Their
suffering certainly cannot be alleviated by giving
them jobs in the Civil Sermice.
With regard to the Budget, the columnist should
inform himself to the fact that no one has to date said
a good word about it. The enticism levelled against
iwhas not come only from the opposition partes, but
also from every economist in Nanubia, including
those who suppor the mayomty party. These are
people who have made their mark in the private
sector, notthe civil service, and who understand what
it takes to make a country’s economy viable
1 believe that as a colummist in a widely read
newspaper like The Namibian, Mr ya Ndakomant
has a responsibility to his readers not to wnte so
thoughtlessly and utesponsibly about issues he clearly
does not understand or has not thought about prop-
erly. If he cares to visit the office of the DTA of
Namibia, we will be happy to inform him about the
many alternatives we have suggested, but which are
regularly wiped off the table in Parliament by Swapo’s
two-thirds majonty, which he no doubt helped to
elect.
