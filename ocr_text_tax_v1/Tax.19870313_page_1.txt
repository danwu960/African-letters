Objections

ACCORDING to a report published
in the Republikein of March 6 1987,
interim government Minister, An.
dreas Shipanga, ‘sharply criticised’
and expressed his ‘disappointment’
about certain statementa the Vicar
General of the Roman Catholic
Church, Father Bernhard Nor-
dkamp, had allegedly made during
an address given at a youth seminar,
which, again according to the report,
is said to have been organised by the
Council of Churches. The report
relates to what Mr Shipanga 1s alleg.
ed to have said during a meeting of

the National Assembly on March 5

1987.

Mr Shipanga, according to the
report, bases his claim about what

the Vicar General had said during

the youth seminar held at Dobra, on

a letter by an unidentified “Win-

~ dhoek student'’ which letter was
- published in the Windhoek Observer

of February 28, 1987. The “student”
alleges, inter alia, that Father Nor-

- dkamp had said that “law and order
are sin”. For the purposes of this

statement it is sufficient to state that
the letter contains further very
serious distortions and outright un-
truths. It represents nothing but a
very ill-considered attempt to amear
the Roman Catholic Church and to
discredit the Vicar General, whose
commitment to bringing about
justice with peace in a truly Chris-
tian society in Namibia is well

| known

Against this background, Mr
Shipanga's criticism ie evidently un-

| warranted and uncalled for. Yet Mr

Shipanga, who holds hia high office
by virtue of an appointment by the
Routh African Government, sean fit

to simply repeat these untrue allege:
tions of what the Vicar General is

taken to have said, relying on
nothing more than an anonymous |
