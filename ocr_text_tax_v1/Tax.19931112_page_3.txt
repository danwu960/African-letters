:  Nowscvery day,mom-
* ingandevening, we have
_ the same handful of peo-
plecalling the talk shows,
' again - and again - and
again, repeating the same
boring accusations,
which are wild, to say
the least.

Come on fellow
Namibians. Le's be in-
telligent about this.

Mr Mubita had his
chance and he didn’t grab

it with both hands.

—_-It seems to be becom-
ing a trend among some
people these days to try
and deflect from the truth
and the reality, and to try
and distort matters, by
raising emotive issues

, which have no bearing
on the facts.

Quite honestly, I feel
these sort of tactics
should be confined to the
trash bin.

We need to push for-
ward, learn from our mis-
takes and in the process
become better people,
