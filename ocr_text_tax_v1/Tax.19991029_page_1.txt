Personal Notices Cost Taxpayer

DR Nickey Iyambo did a most noble
thing in publicly expressing his personal
thanks to those people and institutions
that stood by him during the passing of
his wife. What distracts from the per-
ceived sincerity of this, however, is the
fact that his word of thanks is headed by
the official banner of the Ministry of
Regional and Local Government. As such,
the placing of the block-add was most
likely paid for by the taxpayer.
I do not know what The Namubsan
charges per column/centimetre in a case
like this, but let us assume a charge of

N$5,00 per column/cm and we arrive at a
price tag of N$500,00. Should this ad be
placed in all Windhoek newspapers at

out-of-pocket some N$2500,00. If the
rate is similar to the smalls columns
(N$10,00 per col/cm) then we are look-
ing at a total of N$5000,00.

Dr Iyambo has my commiseration in
the loss that he has suffered. It is unfortu-

nate that his add was so prominent as to

ous ministries continuously place what
should be personal notices with public
money. I am only astounded at the level
of acceptance that has been reached by
the citizens of our county when the

abuse of public funds in this manner
draws no comment.
