| agree that employees could be
guilty of crimes and expeiled, as
happens to many, but who gets
their pension?

Migrant labourers are taxed like
other permanent employees.

| appeal to those in management
to assist in solving these problems,
as the labourers have no other way
| in which to follow up the matter,
There is also the fear of being ex-
pelled if they reveal these matters.
