We don't see any reason why certain
people have to be kept on in the
Kavango. You keep saying pupils
should not involve themselves in
politica, but why do you then associate
with Koevoet? You are also failing to
maintain to law and order in the
region. We know that a good govern-
ment does not maintain law and order
by the barrel ofa gun; not by detaining

le without trial; not with teargas,
and #0 on. A good government main-
tains law and order by addressing the
demands of the society or oppressed, or
at least by giving their grievances a
fair hearing.

Costs of 435

WHAT many Namibians have warned
against for many years has now come
to pass. As soon as the South African
Government tells us of ‘agreement’
with regard toimplementation of 435,
we are informed that it will cost
billionsandthe UN must now look for
the money.

For years, all UN resolutions aimed
at preserving the natural wealth of our
country, have been ignored by South
Africa and all those nations exploiting
our natural resources. South African
occupation of Namibia costs millions
aday but no money is available for the
implementation of the peace plan.
Salaries of South Africa’s proxies in
Namibia have been increased time and
again and for that, money was

available. And in all this, Namibians
had no say, they only paid taxes.

While we are not overexcited at thie
point that the agenda for implementa-
tion will follow the time schedule that
was indicated by the SA Foreign
Minuater, the time has come for Nam.
bians to state their position with
regard to who will foot the bill Surely
we cannot accept that our country has
become a poor and underdeveloped and
dependent country all of a sudden
Therefore we would like to make some
suggestions to the UN Secretary
General who will now be presented
with the bill

Asa people whohave remained self.
reliant through the ages, we would not
hke to become international beygars
at this point and would lhke to con
tribute towards the costs of implemen
tation of UNSCR 435

A few suggestions for Namibians to
ponder

Namibia still has some resources
therefore we propose that an indepen.
dent commission be established im
mediately with complete insight into
all transactions involving monies leav-
ing this country, with immediate
effect,
_ that all export of Namibian natural
resources be monitored by the UN and
all resources accruing therefore, be put
in a fund towards paying for
implementation;
= that with immediate effect, all
monies collected through sales tax be
paid into the abovementioned fund;
C that the exhorbitant salaries paid
to SA proxies in Namibia be im-
mediately stopped and that money be

pat in the abovementioned
all know that the AG andthe BA
civil service runs Namibla and they
should receive salaries from the ool-
onial] power according to international
Practice;
O thatal) these companies which, ac-
cording to the Thirion Report, have
been sending out natural resources il-
legally, or have paid leas taxes than
they should have, be compelled to pay
the said amounts in the implementa.
tion fund;
J that all taxes paid by Namibiansin
order to fund second tier authorities,
be channelled into the said fund.

Since the people of this country have
never hed a say in whathappenstothe
funds collected through the means
above, they should do eo now. The six
points mentioned above are only
pointers. We realise there should be
some control and therefore suggest
that all those parties which have been
in favour of the implementation of 435
now form a watchdog committee and
take this issue up immediately. All
Namibians know that thesaid parties
are constituent members of the /Ai-
/Gams group

Namibiang, the time has come for
you to take up this challenge.
