THE Ministry of Basic Education and Culture
recently printed a thick document advertising hun-
dreds of vacancies at schools in Namibia for 1998.
Is this not a waste of taxpayersâ€™ money printing
such a big document whilst 90% - 999% of the
vacancies are already earmarked or reserved for
candidates? I do not think one needs to come up
with evidence since this is common knowledge
among all teachers and principals. How long will
we tolerate this? Even Nantu and TUN are aware
of corruption and nepotism at schools when it

comes to the appointment of teachers or their

promotion. Are the aspirant teachers not wasting

their time and energy by applying to fill a vacancy

Already Promised

which is already reserved for a specific person? If
these things are still happening when are we going
to start with the process of integrating teachers in
schools? In my understanding integration not only
means taking a black teacher to a white school but
also taking an Ovambo teacher to a Damara or
Nama school. Integration must take place between
Black and White and Black and Black. Fellow
Namibian teachers, let us fight the social evils of
nepotism, corruption and tribalism in Namibian
Schools with all the means at our disposal in order
to build a better education for our children

CONCERNED TEACHER, WINDHOEK
