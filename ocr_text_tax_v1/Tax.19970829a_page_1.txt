THE NAMIBIAN

Sheyapo’s Apology OK But

TPIS worth noting thatit has taken Mi Sheyapo some ten days
of solid silence to apologise tor tis publi remarks on Nanubian
Womenfolk visedovas there telatronships wath forciepers and the
“hiss and tell remarks.

Whichever side of the divide you took on the ensuing sequel
to the remarks, one fundamental issue remains clear and thatas
Hisenough tosay Pam sorry while the substance of the apology
reniuns inthe heart. The recent appeitinentofonly two women
to Swapo'’s Central Committee (by the President) is a clear
mdication of the double-stindards and the dichotoms between
deeds and words from the politread class.

Nanubia is indeed a very nice and peacetul country Cas has
been manitested by the short-term capenence indemocracy ) but
iis certainly notimmune trom “political correctness’ thateven
the world’s most powerful democracy otten falls prey to. Even
President Bush goofed when he asked his countrymen to read his
lips (when interviewed on tax issues in the pre-election cam-
paign).
