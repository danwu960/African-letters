On Income tax

THE budget debate is still on
in our National Assembly so
that my suggestion conceming
the paymem of income tax
remains relevant.

It was quite ironical to hear
Finance Minister, Dr Herrigel,

ing remarks in his budget
speech about closing the loop-
boles in the system of taxing
perks which salary camers
receive.

Who gets more perks than
the Honourable Minister and
his fellow members of the Na-
tional Assembly and they do
not even pay tax on their large
income.

This is what ! find lacking in
the socalled debate about the
beg e Assembly. People

themselves on the
and congratulating the
Finance Minister about a sup-

posedly progressive budget,
instead of addressing the bum-
ing problem that they, like the
Pharisees in Biblical times,
“bind heavy burdens, hard to
bear, and lay them on people's
shoulders, but they themselves
will not move them with their
finger’' (Mathew 23:4).

I ask simply and humbly that
our National Assembly lIcgis-
late that they themselves, who,
after all, eam more than any-
body else, pay income tax an
their salaries and perks.

It is no excuse that it is re-
garded as tradition worldwide
that members of governments
donot pay taxes. It isa mark of

true leadership that those in
ae should not require
of their subjects anything which
they are not prepared to do or
give themselves.

Let Namibia become an
example to governments the
world over thal we are a truce

democracy oven in this respect.
IL ‘s only when the minister of
finance of a country and his
peers in government are sub-
ject to the same obligations as
other citizens of that country
that they will be sensitive to
the problems and needs of their
fellow citizens.

I hereby invite other con-
cemed Namibians to take up
this debate in this newspaper
so that it will hopefully be-
come a concern for our gov-
emment.
