scandalous
accusation

! MY attention is drawn to the letter
| entitled ‘Foreigner’s woes’ by acer-
tain Mrs Cox of Olympia which
appeared in The Namibian of No-

vember 19,

Mrs Cox claims to have come to
Namibia six months ago with ‘'the
intention of establishing a legitimate
business’’. She was however, sur-
pnsed to have been told to call back
after three months for the work per-
mit which she is yet to receive.

Mrs Cox also put several questions
to the readers, such as:

- she does not know the reason for
the duration required for the process-
ing of passportfeitizenship documents.

| According to her three months is too

, long and extensions if necessary, are

, Not acceptable to her.

| 7 Mrs Cox does not teel officers of

_ the Ministry of Home Affairs have

' the nght to satisfy themselves in

| | —_ .

; accordance with their job descrip-
hon, whether such information is
contained in the application forms or
not:

- she felt the Ministry is practising
delaying tactics and wants the Minis-
ter of Home Affairs to ‘call his offi-
cals to order’,

| According to her, Namibians were
not treated in the same way in her
country which she has not named.

These scandalous accusations di-
rected against our Govemment and
our law enforcement agency cannot
go unchallenged.

First of all, the socalled Mrs Cox

"failed to state her full name and address,

her country of origin and the type of

business she wants to undertake in

Namubia.

Secondly, official documents are
not just dished out anyhow, espe-
cially to foreigners, whether it be
passport, identity card, citizenship,
residential and work permits (that
may be done in the country Mrs Cox
comes from), ,

permanent residence or citizenship,

nised rig
