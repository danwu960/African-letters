Kaoko
destruction

AFTER a silence of nearly
one year we have decided
to inform you again about
the tournsm situaton in
Kaokoland and other related
matters.

The destruction on all
levels is getting more in-
tense every day. One of the
biggest contribuung factors
are the two articles that were
published last year in Get-
away, a magazine for tour-
ism in SA. Extra car tracks,
fire places, rubbish and a
direct interference with the
lives of local people are but
a few senous problems. Is
there any control to deter-
mine the number of cars
entering the area and do the
authorities know whether
these visitors follow the basic

are not enough. Construc-
tive planning on all levels is
required to save this area.
Are you, as a Namibian,
satisfied that this unique
ecosystem gets trampled by
cars? Is it acceptable that
the people of this area get
exploited and disgraced by
people who do not care for
them, but see them most of
the time as primitive and
lazy?

If the government does
not take a positive attitude
towards the future of this
area, very soon you might
find that the socalled ‘last
wildemess’ has changed into
the lost wilderness. There is
no doubt in my mind that no
senior official in the depart-
ment of Wildlife, Conser-
vation and Tourism knows
what is going on in Kaokol-
and. Did any of them visit
the area in the past three

tules? The answer on both | years to get a detailed pic-
questions is a definite NO. | ture or were there any re-

If they knew the answers
they would have reacted a
long ume ago.

To draw people into a
sensitive area like Kaokol-
and without contol is fatal.
Is there any control andif so

by whom is itenforced? Who | and to fly into the Skeleton

gives Mr Joubert the nght
to have ‘his route’ pro-
claimed as an official 4x4
route?

Promises of proclamatidn

Coast does not serve any
purpose.
An even more sensitive
subject is the Skeleton Coast.
Itis well known that this big

area is open to one safari
company only and that all
other operators have no
chance to go in there.

Why does one company
have the privilege to make
money out of an exclusive
area while other operators
who can give the same serv-
Ice are neglected? We more
than once offered to stay
within all rules applicable
to this area and also to pay ;
concession fees. Why can
people from this country not
visit the area just because it
is too expensive. There are
operators in this country who
can give the same service at
half the present fly-in price.
To allow two or three op-
erators in the area can only
mean more money for tour-
ism in this country. Why
the blatant favouritism? The
night to enter the area cer-
tainly cannot belong to one
person only and if that is the
case then the system in this
area 1S cormpt.

As a taxpayer of this
country I am certainly en-
titled to know what conces-
ston fees are paid yearly for
this big area.

Is the present concession
still valid? It was clearly
Stated in early 1991 that the

concession would be temni- |

nated on 31 December 1991
and thereafter it would be
decided what to do with the

area. After six months it is
sull the same operator. What
is happening to honesty and
integrity?

What is the present state
with regard to the western
part of Kaokoland being
declared as a nature reserve
area?

Why do the authorities
openly allow the wide-scale
smuggling of liquor in
Kaokoland (and other ar-
eas)? For a group of tourists
to encounter drunk people
at villages cannot be to the
advantage of tourism inthis J).
country. Is this smuggling
within the law of the coun-
try?
The public have the night
to know what is going on
when it comes to matters of
general importance. This
beautiful country belongs to
all Namibians and we cer-
tainly have a right of en-
tmace into certain areas,
especially when there is more
than just the one option |
available.

Why does everybody at
the moment close theireyes
to the problems of Kaokol-
and? Is it ignorance or what
1s the problem?

Your comments as a reader

are appreciated. It can only
help for better understand-
ing ifa senior official in the
department can give us
objective and concise an-
swers to these problems.
