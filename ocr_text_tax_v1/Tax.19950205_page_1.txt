letter is to inform the public
at large about what appears
tome as black racism. What
do we Namibians say about
this? Let me end this letter
with a quote of a remark
made by Mark Twain to
Maxim Gorky: “He who
dares to visit acountry other
than his own should have
the audacity to behave’ in
conformity with the laws of
that country”.

Our priorities

IT seems for me to be the
time that the Government
puts the priorities of our
country night.

On the one side we have
problems with our budget.
We are dependent on help
from abroad. We are wait-
ing in vain for investments.
We are suffering from a most
serious drought ...

On the other side I learned

that the Government is in-
tending to buy a special

aircraft for the President and
nhisters at an amount of
R20 million. If One adds the

costs for maintenance, the

crew, fuels, landing charges
and others, the costs incurred
and to be paid by the tax-
payers will be around R30

million.

For those R30 million we

can buy:
* 1 million bails of lucerne;
or

* 43 000 t or 652 000 bags

of maize or

_ * 22 000 first class air tick-
ets for the State President, .

Ministers and other high
officials for a retour trip to
London, Bombay or New
York; or

* we can build approxi-
mately 5 000 core houses.

R30-million means R21
per capita or R200 for a
family with four children. It

a,

means RISO for each per-
som on work in the modern
sector OF approxumaeh
R550 for each revistered
taxpayer.

On the one side the State
President and his Ministers
used to remind us that we
must save, that we have to
work harder to be more
productive and to be less
luxurious on weekends ..

But on the other hand the
Parliament made acts by
which we enjoy today seven
more public holidays and
seven more yearly holidays
than in the past. Accord-
ingly, our productivity has
decreased by 6 per cent and
the costs of production have
increased by 4 per cent ...

What are our priorities
now?
