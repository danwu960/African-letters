Therefore, our leaders should stop
condoning, through reconciliation,
those on the other side of the canip

them in the elections.

Five years from now ts a shon
penod of time and if the leadership
don't start meeting the expectations
and demands of their electorate now,
they may be in trouble. Democracy
has ite good and bad sides, and the
bad side is that the situation can

sales tax and import tax were intro-

This ruthless exptoitation of our
people by the colomial regime was at
the time understandable. Bul now
that Namibia is free and the war is
ended, we see no reason why his
heavy tax should continue unabated.
We do understand the concem of the
government to generae funds through
revenue, but this should not be done
through open and blatant exploita-
tion.

This is my view will only enhance
tho system of the rich getting richer
and the poor getting poorer. Whar the

maintain personal income tax and

abolish avertime super tax and gen-

While we all agree with the fact
thatthe Government has only been in
office for a short ime of eight months,
the vear 1991 must be a year of
practical restructuring and socio
econonuc improvements.

The immigration issue is also sen-
ous, and the Home Affairs Munustry
must set up a committee to Jook into
applications for citizenship and resi-
dent work permits for foreigners.

Swapo leadership should work hard
to convince its followers that Na-
mubia is for Namibians and noi for
foreigners.
