NBC May Be Sued

For Biased

RECENT reporting onthe
NBC has demonstrated
biased information that
does notrefect the ethics
Of good journalism An
OrRanssanion charged wath
such an importantrespon
sibility toinforin (and not
misinform) the nation rs
currently viewed as he-
ing more concemed with
sensation rather than re-
porting the truth and sub-
stance in the news.

Acoupke of weeks ago.
an the eightoâ€™ clock news
bulletin, tt was reported
that seven people were
caught at the Windhock
International Arrpost in
Possession of stolen air
tickets and Kenyan pass-
ports. These people were
reported to hase tnied to
board Air Namibia to
burope. They were how
evercuuehtin the prowess
and their passpons con
liscated for screening
having confirmed they
possessed stolen tickets

This ston. sensational
cnough ino my personal
View, apparently lacked
cnough fustre in the
NBC's newsroom. There-
fore, to make It more
thrilling, the Nigerian ts-
suc had to be brought in,
even though the national-
ity of the culprit had not
been confirmed.

It my personal opinion
that NBC lacks the neces-
sary skilled personne! in
Carrying out its duty in an
effective and professional
manner. The organisation
should be restructured to
accommodate competent
staff be it Namibian or
foreign. This will save the
establishment (NBC) and
more particularly the gov-
emment from embarrass-
ment in the court of law.

The organisation has
predictably displayed in-
consistency in executing

biased reporting This has
undermined its crtcal
role in furnishing the na-
Gon, and more impor-
tantly, NBC listener with
useful informatian
Nigeria had always
been the black sheep in
HOS spectacular reporting
on fraud related news
Theretore, the quesuaon in
my mind as a Namibian
who lived for fifteen years
in Nigernats whether there
18 nO good news to be
reported about Nigeria?
Every good shill 1 pos-

have really helped me in
the capacity in which |

erninent officials who

swath me

tis my behet that most
of these biased reporters
have nevervisited Nigena
betore neither do they
hase an in depth picture
of the situation in that
country. They should
therefore conduct criucal
investigations before en-
gaging in such destruo-
tive reporting that has
constantly undermined
the integrity of the aver-
age Nigerian.

I must also take this
Opportunity to question .
the role of the Nigerian
Embassy in Windhoek
They appear to have miss-
ing their purpose in pro-
moting Nigeria's image
and protecting its citizens,
If they continue to be tn-
ert in exercising their
duty, I suggest the em-
bassy should be closed
down to avoid unneces-

sary expenses that have
eroded the tax payers
money.
