Tell Us About ‘Dream Deal’

Letters Hoe the
EAtite

1 AM reterming to the
“dreamdeal’ clinched by
CDM with our peoples
government. ,
The more one takes
note of the persistent
inner issues of the deal,
the more Iam starting to
seriously question the
loyalty, ability and ca-
pacity of the Namibian
team of negotiators.
Considering the fact
that CDM, with its mo-
nopolistic conduct of
business, needed a part-
ner like the government
that would otherwise
sustain their dead end
track, why give intosuch
a lopsided arrangement?
Was the agreement
due to unfair composi-
tion of the negotiating
team or were favours

offered?

Both of these are valid
questions that need to be
analysed by the nation
as a whole. It 1s aknown
fact that Namibia, and
especially the inner cir-
cle of cadres considered
on the basis of their in-
volvement in the bush
struggle, does not offer
the depth and ability to
negotiate their win.

This no doubt leaves
the leadership with a
very slim base from
which to compile a
strong effective team that

could ensure a win-win
situation at all costs.

This, coupled with fi-
nancial favours, is some-
thing not new to CDM
operations and could
have been decisive fac-
tors in making the
Namibian team lose
sight... Why else should
they agree to aclause on
confidentiality and ex-
clusivity on sales.

How can we expect the
respect of the Namibian
nation by telling them
we are not going to let
them know anything at

all? Was this not why we
were fighting? Are we
doing this type of thing
because we consider the
intellectual and analyti-
cal capacity of our peo-
ple as zero?

We do not nced CDM
- CDM needs us.

The land is ours, our
great grandfathers and
grandmothers, the
Mandumes, Witbovis,
Kutakos and Morengas,
are the ones who sacri-
ficed for this land.

CDM has no right to
determine the terms - we

should call the shots! We
are not to be sold out. No
one has that right.

The President, under
his able guidance. has
brought us to where we
are today.

Hts career cannot be
compromised by junior
officials. We cannottum
around onthe Namibian
people now.

Make public the con-
tents of the agreement!
If the Government has
agreed to lowering the
amount of tax due to the
State, withdraw from
this sham without delay.

Do not underestimate
the intelligence of the
Namibian people.
