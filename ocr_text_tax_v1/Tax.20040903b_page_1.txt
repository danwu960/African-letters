Catalysts Not Working The Way They Should

WE know that Namibia is officially classified as a less
developed country (LDC) and needs money — plenty
of itin order to cater for its development needs. We
also know that multinationals, such as De Beers, BP,
Shell, cte. have plenty of money, which they are will-
ing to invest,

A recent UN report on human development, which
compares the level of human des clopment among na-
tions, revealed that Namibta has slid down a couple of
places on the world ranking The Nanubian gini coet-
ficient, which mdicates the gap between the poor and
the rich. has also skyrocketed to become the widest in
the world. Although these statsties can be interpreted
differently to suit Vanous perspectives, the one fact
that remains undisputed from whichever perspective
ong looks atit is that the average Namubian’s living
standard has notimproved atall. The question then is
why not? Why could Namibra not make a meanineful
improvement on the wealth of vs natronals? T want to
look at this question from the perspective of muluna-
uonal presence inthe country, because, [strongly belief
they are supposed to be the catalystof development in
any country. Their presence is supposed to boost job
creation, business confidence, financial development.
productivity and further investments.

‘tas clear from the above-stated statusues that the
presence of muttinationals have not boosted Namibia's
wealth creation (poverty eradication) objective.

One of the reasons for this ts that histoncally mult.
nationals are Known for bringing lots of money in, but
sending lots more out - much of it through the back
door’. Itis thts backdoor exit of money from the least
developed countries ke Namibia that destroys their
hopes of ever cradicating pov erty. The backdoor chan-
neling of money 1s done through various means, among

others, embezzlement, diversion of funds, undervalu-
ation of local inputs, false invoicing, non-payment of
taxes, kickbacks and bribery.

for example: We are currently paying extremely
high prices for petrol. Under the current arrangement
all our petrol is coming via South Africa through the
big five - Shell, BP. Engen, Caltex and Total. The base
and landing price calculation is formulated on South
African In Bond Landed Cost IBLC) structure, which
has little, if at all, direct relation to intemational on]
trading prices.

Thts inevitably leads to Nanubians subsidizing the
excessive South African refining margins. This also
enables the oll companies to effectively keep the profits
thatthey make on supplying the fuel to Namibia outside
the country. This diversion of funds 1s one way of back-
door channeling of money, which depriy es the country
of much needed revenue and forces the government
to pass the cost on to the consumer by way of higher
prices al the pumps.

tAxamples of this nature are plenty tn almost all the
sectors of the economy. But whilst we are sll at the
petroleum sector, one should maybe quickly raise an-
otherconcern. Isitteasible fora country like Nambia to
procure anational strategie resource ike petroleum from
a single source (South Africa)? Although not relevant
to the above argument, one needs to critically analy 2e
this concem and maybe create a different platform to
address it. For now, let us scruunsze the operations
of these so-called multinationals and ensure that they
keep human development in Namibia on top of their
agendas
