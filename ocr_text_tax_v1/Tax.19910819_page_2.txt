can do something with it. All
the ex-Koevoets and SWATF
members received their pay-
outs with no problems - at least
let this apply to Plan fighters
too.

In other countries, people
make special programmes for
special problems. Like what
happened in Zimbabwe a few
years ago when they faced a
problem of schools. There were
many children in schools but
not enough to pay the teachers,
and so they increased tax for
those civil servants who were
getting high salanes and em-
ployed teachers to add to their
total number.

Now we have businessmen
and churches and other organ-
isations in our country - why
can't some of them contribute
to the development bngades
so that people can get some-
thing. Also all ex-Plan mem-
| bers must get paid out. What is
| causing conflict is those people

who know that they do not
qualify for this money because
