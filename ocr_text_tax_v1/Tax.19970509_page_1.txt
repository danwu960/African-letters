If this state of affairs in the Ministry of Home af-
fairs 1s allowed to continue. we are shooting ourselves
1n the foot.

Lalso understand that the Prime Minister's Office
plans to launch an cfticiency programme. } think
Home Affairs perfectly deserves to be among the first
clients of such a programme.

Finally, and little bit unrelated, when last have the
fees of Namibian permits been reviewed. They are
nidiculously tow compared with what other countries
charge for particularly work permits, permanent and
lemporary residence permits and study permits. |
think the GRN is losing potential income. What about
charging departure taxes at the airport particularly
with the imminent commercialisation of the ports?
