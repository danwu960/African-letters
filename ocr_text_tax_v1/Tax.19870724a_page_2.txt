-D) Guerrilla War:

The war, especially in Owambo, con-
tributes tothe misery ofthe locals. As
-aresult ofthe political uncertainty and
‘lack of international recognition, in-
vestments are not readily made in
‘Namibia, with resultant meagre job
creation. The spill-over of the war in
Angola, streches our limited resources
with refugees.

E) Good Medica! Services:

As a result of good medical services
more people survive in an otherwise
often hostile environment. There isa
sense of fatalism and the beliefthat the
State will provide for all needs. This 1s
often demanded as a right which the
State has to satisfy. Unfortunately this
demand is not matched by responsibil.
ty or contribution. In order to try and
solve the problem, and to avoid an
ecological and biological disaster, the
problem must be tackled with political
will.

A) Population Planning:

Namibia isnyt arichcountry. Many of
its resources are transient cy.
diamonds(CDM), base minerals(TC1.),
uranium (Rossing), gas(KUDU), and
gold(Karibib). When the mines close,
this source of income is gone. The
resources remaining will be farming,
fishing, tourism and human. If the
human resource is planned and nur.

tured it will be the most important.

One Just has to look at Japan, a coun-
try with virtually no natura!
resources, but an incredible human
resource.

Due to the population explosion,
China has taken drastic steps aiming
at one child per family. Parents who
want more will have to pay and forfeit
free services and free schooling. This
may sound very radical but one hasto
he cruel to be kind. The alternative is
another Ethiopia. Here the initial
worldwide enthusiasm and Bob
eldoft waned as 400n as the TV im.
ages faded and aid mismanay
became known gement

Population planning can also not be
seen in the white/black political con-
text. Already blacks outnumber
whites by more than twelve to one.
Whether it is two to one or 12 to one
makes no difference in aone-manone-
