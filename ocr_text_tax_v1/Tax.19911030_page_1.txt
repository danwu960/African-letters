After the action

WE hear a great deal about
‘affirmative action’ - but do
we ever look back after the
action and judge the results
thereof? For one thing is clear:
It never stops increasing the
mumber of employees and
inventing new (often superflu-
ous) functions in our civil serv-
ice with little attention paid to
qualities such as productivity
and effectiveness of purpose.
We seem to believe more and
more in numbers and pay less
and less attention to the func- |
tional and productive parts of
the service.

Hail a free press! For, if |
had to tell the relevant minis-
ter what I thought of the pro- —
duchvity of some of his staff
members, he would surely have
censored me if he had the power
to do so. One thing is certain:
no private business has a snow-
ball’s chance of survival in
hell if it employs the number
of ineffective and unproduc-
tive owkrers that the civil serv-
ice appears to be content with.
Any private business will go
bust and have its doors closed
even before it has a chance to
present its Board with an
‘additional budget’ to conceal
its mistakes.

We are now running at 25 to
1 - that is, for every 25 souls
living in Namibia, from cradle
to grave, there is one civil
servant lurking in the dark. | |
Perhaps the secret aim is to | .
achieve a 20:1 orevena 10:1 | |
situation whentheentirecoun- | |
try will be one big civil serv- |
ice, with no outsiders to tax for
st.
