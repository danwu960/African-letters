INOTICE from the Windhoek
Advertiser of January 22 that
Telcom is going private.
Hopefully this will mean that
when placing telephone direc-
tory and yellow pages entrics

we can in future deal with a
Namibian company instead of
Maister Directories from Cape
Town. .

When I look at the amount I
pay each month for directory
entries and extrapolate that
across the board, it is apparent
that our directory and yellow
pages must be worth millions.
Perhaps the Postmaster Gen-
eral or the responsible Minis-
ter could, therefore, advise:

- Why a company which
operates from Cape Town and
which does not even have an
office in Namibia and which
does not employ Namibians,
bat send their own people up
from Cape Town for about two
months every year, have been
given this very hicrative con-
tract?

- Whether Maister Directo-
nes pay tax in Namibia on
what they carn here?

- If not, why not?

- If the contract is awarded
on a tender basis, with privati-
sation will the directly con-
tract be thrown open to tenders
from local businessmen who
can then éstablish an office
here, employ Namibians, pay
taxes and generally benefit our
country as a whole?

I ask these questions as it
seems that Maister Directo-
nes; have had this contract for
many, many years and it has
never been awarded to anyone
else.

With independence, we nast
now stand on our own two feet
and do away with foreign
companies who literally take
the money and run back to
Cape Town. We must estab-

lish local businesses employ-
ing local people. Giving the
directory /yellow pages contract
to a Namibian will be a step in

the right direction.

I look forward to hearing
what the powers that be have
to say.
