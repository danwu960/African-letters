the onslaught of elobahsation and achieve long term
economic growth, hose im the education and training

Both camps, as faras Lani concerned, are necessary
abd should therefore not be seen as mutually exclusive
because a Namibia with an uatramned and uneducated
workforce will not be attractive to foreren investors,
