Queries On NBC

1 CONSIDER myself an updated person,
therefore I like listening to NBC news
and other current affairs. But the words
‘this internaption is receiving Our aften-
tion - please stay tuned’ is really puthng
me off. If they are saying that there is DO
money to replace the old equipment they

ir disposal, what happens to

the money they got
ine the President was giving 4
the nation and it was di

from the state? Imag-

speech to
It is DO

‘Blackouts’

wonder that heads are to roll at the finan-
cially stricken corporation. Maybe it will

ring changes to the people who are misus-
ip ion’s funds. We are very

g the
‘red of seeing all the taxpayers’ money
go to waste - which means that they are
just going down the drain and that drain is
some selfish officials who are not think-
ing for the nation at large.
