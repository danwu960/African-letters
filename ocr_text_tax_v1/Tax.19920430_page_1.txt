Colleagues and I noticed
that the head of the centre
acts as though the place is
sulla pnson.

Furthermore, since the
place is a youth centre,
besides the name change, |
would further like to add to
the recommendations, that
a library be placed in the
youth centre which should
have information on the May
4 massacre and its signifi-
Cance to the struggle for
freedom. Bele fo

Also the guard towers
around the camp must be
removed and the place,
especially if children are to
be in it, thoroughly searched
for ammunition of all types
because the finding of such

No to botsotsos

THROUGH the medium of
your newspaper please al-
low me to address the mat-
ter of those many faceless
individuals who are so suc-
cessfully destroying the
integrity of our city and
undermining the security of
our nation by their tax-free
enterprises at the expense
of other, hardworking
Namibian men and women.
I refer to the botsotsos
who believe that everyone
else's possessions belong to
them and are just placed
there for them to take.
Twice daring last week in

shop of Port Eliza-

ghchad been invited by

Holy Week Programme and
had arrived bringing with
him his wife and three other
people from his Diocese.
At 10h15 on the Tuesday
following their arrival, a
gang of three young men
were interrupted when they
broke through the rear win.
dow of the Bishop’s car.

They turned on the per-
son who shouted at them to
Stop and threatened him with
death “when they found him
in Katutura”! That was bad
enough.

On Easter Day, between
lunchtime and 18h30,
thieves struck again, this time
taking the Bishop’s trailer
from the car park where it
had been secured by chain
and lock to a fence post.
uled to leave at 07h00 the
next momung this latest
episode caused quite a dis-
ruption.

We then had to arrange
for them to borrow another
trailer to take their luggage
home in.

One lot of visitors - ‘hit’
twice in one week - very
sad! If only it were an iso-
lated incident. Unfortunately
we all know it 1s not so,
because many of us have
had to contend with cases
of a similar nature ourselves.

In this area, the botsotsos
regularly thieve from cars
parked outside our church
during worship services on
Sundays.

I am not advocating any
form of vigilante action here
but I do wish to appeal to
John and Jane Citizen not to
buy the goods these gang
members offer for sale to
them.

If there is no ready and
willing market, it would not

' be worth the botsotsos ime

and energy to steal, or cer-
tainly they would not have
to steal so much - one TV
and VCR should be enough!

In the long run we are all
having to pay much, much
more for the botsotsos ex-
travagant lifestyles than we
initially imagined - their acts
of crime are making a dis-
cernible dent in our national
economy apart from ad-
versely affecting the climate
for attracting many poten-
tial investment opportuni-
tes.

I HAVE n following
events clos#ly an the dis-
cussion of WAvig Bay from

When The N: ’s ref-
erendum results pere posi-
tive I thought that negotia-
tions on Walvis Bay would

take on a different momen-
tum.
