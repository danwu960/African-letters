Okalongo Senior Pri-
mary School would like
to raise our problems to
the Ministry of Educa-

- teachers are wasting
taxpayers money - they
attend only two lessons a

- some subjects are
taught by inexperienced
teachers which results in
failures for most students
at the end of the day,
especially Grade ]Ocan-

- the inspector does not
consult students on their

Ovambadjas as being ap-
pointed regardless of
their qualifications.

Therefore we are urg- |
ing Nanso as well as the
