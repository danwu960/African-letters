I WOULD like to address this letter
to both Enok and SWABC.-TV.

Tam doing this because both these
corporations are competing with the
private sector while at thesametime
they enjoy the taxpayer's financial
security.

Both Radio and TV are competing
with private sector advertising
media. Why should they take the
money which rightfully belongs to
the newspapers?

Secondly, why should Enok, the
development corporation, have to
compete with the private sector in
things like wholesalers and garages,
butcheries and so on? There are
many Namibian businessmen who
are capable of running such
businesses.

Instead Enok should be concen-
trating on building factories that will
produce commodities which are
presently imported from South
Africa. This country has no fac-

Corporations compete with private sector

tories, most items are bought from
South Africa. If the Corporation
would start building factories there
would be more yob opportunities in
Our country and things could be
manufactured here. In this way,
things would cost less, and the slogan
‘Investin Namibia, Buyin Namibia’
would become a reality.

Isn't it the job of the interim
government Cabinet to pass such a
bill, instead of a billon stock theft?
Why should the Cabinet evade the
real issues? The label, ‘Made in
Namibia’, should become a fact.

Why does the Cabinet make the
theft of diamonds acrime and yet let
CDM drain the country of diamonds
atthe same time? Rossing, TCL and
Other mining companies are doing
the same.

Why can Namibian towns be built
up like Johannesburg? If the wealth
of Namibia was evenly distributed,
the poorest man in the country

should be living ina house like those
in Arandis.

What 1s the problem with the
‘Cabinet’? Are you really ministers
or just socalled? Our country is be-
ing bled, do something now for
tomorrow may be too late.

Remember: minerals don't breed.

IN THE LIGHT of the fact that our
Coloured schools have been in the
news jately, I have a number of
questions.

Myself and other parents looked
forward to secing what the pass
percentages were of matriculants last
year. Now | must read in a local
newspaper that, according to the Ad-
ministration for Coloureds, these
figures are a secret. How onearthcan
the percentage passes be kept a
secret?

As a Coloured taxpayer, I appeal
to Mr Billy Phillips, Chairman ofthe
Executive Committee and member
charged with Education, to make
known this figure, as well as that of
the Standard Eights for last year.

Recently there have also been
many reports that the Coloured
schools in Khomasdal are full and
that hundreds of students are sent
home. According to Mr Koopman,
Director of Education, the situation
is to be ascribed to the following:

* many parents have moved from
rural areas to Windhoek

* parents whose children-were last
year in South Africa, are now at
schools in Windhoek

* Coloureds in South Afnca, who
by virtue of present conditions there,
send their children to Windhoek
schools.

These reasons are correct, but Mr
Koopman forgot to mention the
mostimportant one, namely the fact
that children from Katutura are
streaming into Khomasdal schools.

{am notasupporter of apartheid.
not in the least. ] am saving these
things in the light of the apartheid
kingdom (AG 8) which the Labour
Party of Mr Dawid Bezuidenhout
and Mr Billy Phillips and company,
accepted, and according to which
they govern.

If people accept acertain govern:
ment system, then they should
govern according to the letter and
spirit of it, and not mercly in accor-

ON OS at Be ee

dance with those parts which suit
them.

In accordance with Proclamation
AG 8, the personal tax of each tax-
payer is paid to the second tier
authority of the population group of
which he is a member. A certain por-
tion of that tax is used for education.
| am sure that the greatest percentage
of the Coloured budget 1s spent on
education. In other words, the bulk
of the taxpayer’s money is spent on
education.

In the fight of this, Mr Phillips
should reply immediately to the
following questions:

* Why are hundreds of black
children allowed in our schools,
while our own children are sent
home?

* Do the parents of black children
pay taxes to the Coloured
Administration?

If the answer is yes, then I would
like to know what these parents pay.

Once again I wish to say that | am

strongly opposed to any form of
apartheid but I want toprovethat AG
8, which Mr Phillips and Company
accepted, is not implementable, and
our concern is because our children
are losing out educationally.

In a radio interview, Mr Burden,
Rector of the Khomasdal training
college, said that 40 percent fewer
students had been accepted at the
College this year. 1 further hear that
most of the students come from
South Africa and other ethnic
groups.

}call upon Mr Phillips to give us
these figures too. How many
students are from South Africa and
other ethnic groups? ThenI wantto
know the costs of running the Col-
lege per annum.

Mr Phillips must also tell us why
it is necessary to have an apartheid
coliege near to the Academy? Is ita
question of his imitating his white
apartheid brothers?

Year after year we must hear how

m a Khomasdal taxpayer

teachers are imparted from South
Africa and placed in senior posts,
while our own teachers with equal or
higher quatifications are overlook-
ed. With respect to the ‘imported’
teachers, I must say that some of
them are the weakest teachers, who
have said they could not get jobs in
South Africa, but here they are given
senior posts.

I want 10 ask Mr Phillips why he
has made our schools, the rubbish
heap of South African teachers?

The only way out of this govern-
ment system (AG 8), which is accep-
table tono one but the leaders of the
Coloured Labour Party, is to scrap it
in its totality. Let the true political
leaders, and not the ‘yes-boss’ types
and political opportunists, work out
a system which is acceptable to the
people of this country.

The fact that the South Afnean

PEOPLE In Karirib are faced with
a serious problem and people in
Namibia should become aware of it.

As weall know, iob opportunities

We are not ignorant and are not

In Karirib, many young men and
women are wandering around
jobless. Some of these stay at the
homes of their parents, and are forc-
ed to pay what we call Kopteks (rent)
which had already been paid by their
parents. Dog taxes are payable and if
one does not pay for his dog, he is
afraid the dog will be shot.

Sanitary conditions in the black
town are bad, and there are no taps
inthe houses, and only some of them
have electricity. Only those who

to pay for the use of it, .

YOU HAVE GIVEN Vice Bishop
Kameeta space in your newspaper to
voice his opinion. I request thesame
opportunity since you call yourself
achampion for freedom of specch.

Mr Kameeta claims that the in-
dependence of Namibia is an in-
alienableright, and that it isdemand-
ed without conditions attached. He
isright, but why does he, and his par-
ty, Swapo, refuse to acknowledge any
other political opinion in this de-
mand for independence?

Why doesn't Mr Kameeta use his
high office to ensure justice, peace
and freedom for every Namibian?
He is aware of the fact that Swapo
does not tolerate opposition. He
knows that everybody opposing
Swapo will be subject to arbitrary
punishment or even execution
without a fair trial. Mr Kameeta
should support the call made by The
Namibian on Swapo toensurea fair
hearing for those who are accused of
being spies for South Africa.

Mc Kameeta should be aware of
the fact that many political parties in
Nainibia have urged Swapoto be an
equal partner in their opposition to
South Africa. He should also know
that Swapo refuses to drop the adjec-

tive ‘sole and authentic represen.
tative of the people of Namibia’. Ms
Lister should inform Mr Kameeta of
what her experiences are concerning
this imposed status on Swapo. Mr
Kameeta, who has vowed to preach
love, peace and righteousness,
should bein the front to ensure that
every Namibia be granted the right
and the opportunity to work towards
independence of this country,

Mr Kameeta knows that Swapo
regards violence as the only viable
means of attaining independence tor
Namibia, but does he consider the
fact that the majority people inthis
country are peaceloving Christians
and thus prefer a negotiated
setdement?

Mr Kamecta calls for boycotts and
disinvestment and calls the potential
suffering of the majority of people
‘empty phrases’. Simultaneously this
Vice Bishop demands that ‘all peo-
ple must have the right to decent
housing, and bring up their famulics
incomfort and secunty. Free medical
care and hospitalisation must be pro-
vided for all, with special care for
senior citizens, mothers and small
children. The aged and disabled must
be fully cared for by the State’.

Has it occurred to Mr Kameeta
that toreign investment is vital to
achieve these aims? Mr Kameeta 1s
fully aware of the fact that Swapo
and the CCN regularly call on inter-
national financial support to
alleviate the plight of the people.
Why then should only his party and
Ws followers benefit from financial
aid and not the majority of the
people?

Will Mr Kameeta care to tell the
public how much he earns and how
much he pays in taxes? Will Mr
Kaniceta be prepared Co inform the
people ot this country about the
lnfestyde of those who profess to fight
tor independence and lberation
about their contribution towards the
alleviation of the suffering people in
the form of finangial contributions?

Can Mr Kamectainform the publicol

what he proposes should be dane to
obtain sufficient funds to attain what
all the people in Namibia desire?
Mr contention as that Swapo ts
guilty of the most atrocious
discrimination against people. Mr
Kameeta 1s actively engaged in
Swapo's political activities, this
makes him guilty of discriminating
aguinst his own people too. Accor-

ding to the Oxford dictionary,
discrimination means to ‘make a
distinction, to give unfair treatment,
especially because of prejudice’.
Swapo and Mr Kameeta call
everybody who does not compty with
their conditions and with their opi-
mons, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pets etc. Everybody who dares to
speak against Swapo is threatened
and intimidated. Every person who
docs not support Swapo is being
discriminated against. This 1s
definitely not what the majority of
Namibians willsupport, thisis what
the majoruyof the Namibians want
eradicated,

Mr Kameeta claims his fame and
right to speak about pohtical matters
on his arrestand detention. For any
law-abiding citizen, especaally for
devoted Christians, defiance of the
law isdetestable. If Mr Kamectaasa
Vice Bishop and even more as a
Swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
ahenable right to self-determunation,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not support an
organisation which sees only
violence as a means of achieving

whal they desire, namely, to take over
power of this country.

Mr Nujoma has declared more
than once that Swapo is not in-
terested in powersharing, but only in
power itself, During his recent pro-
paganda tour for Swapoin West Ger-
many, Mr Kameeta has proven that
he is against any form of opposition
to Swapo and that he disputes the
right of ficedom of speech of a Ger-
man citizen in his own country. With
this act added to his political antics
against the people of thiscountry, Mr
Kameeta has disqualified himself of
claiming to be i champion for
freedom, Justice and peace.

this. We want the same toilets as
those used by the white man. We
want flush toilets. |

Karirib is one of the oldest places
in Namibia but it is not developed.
The houses are old and in a state
of collapse, Taps are closed down
and one has to walk a distance to
get water. White people are
- noufied if there are problems with

Dear Mr Cleary

YOU too have done some ‘remarkable’
pieces of writing, most recently in
Leadership (Volume $ 1986 Number 2),
in which you measure the success of ihe
interim government by means of the
vague generaltsation of ‘inclusivity’.
This ‘government’, you say, seeks to in-
volve all parties and also to draw to
these same parties, the support
previously enjoyed by those outside it.

May we remind you that there are six
parties (some in name only) which en-
joy membership of the interim govern-
ment. Membership of ‘other parties’,
however minor their support, who have
shown interest in the interim govern-
ment, has been turned down, and I refer
in particular to the recent HNP request
for membership of the ‘Constitutional
Council’.

‘Inclusivity’, therefore, hardly seems
to be the goal of this interim
government,

You have not explained why the DTA
prefers to operate outside your con-
sultancy service, and it has been wide-
ly reported (not only in The Namibian)
that there has been a breakdown in
communication between yourself and
Mr Dirk Mudge, an interim government
miniMer you claim to represent,

What is perhaps of note, is your
— geference to the ‘Transitional Govern-

| ment’, rather than the ‘Government of

National Unity’, Even you can no-

longer claim that there is “unity” in their
ranks, any more than you can claim that
there is ‘consensus’ on the question of
AG 86 despite socalled mnanimnous

resolutions concerning the removal of —

ethnic and racial discrimination.

WE, 1
- Gebiet, have kept a close eye on the
maelstrom politics of the Basters
recently, and we are sick and tired
to this underhand, directionless
politicking over our heads - we
challenge the Basters to direct
negotiate with us.

We wish to inform the Baster
government that we have serious
reservations about the statements in
recent weeks.

Firstly, about the socalled ‘open
schools’. In spite of the Baster
government's eelf-expressed policy
that all schools in the Gebiet are open
to all regardless of race or colour, it
is not the Baster children who are be-
ing driven out of these ‘open schools’
- at a time when the whole of
Namibia is striving for open schools.

Money from Baster taxpayers. We
would like to know which Baster tax
payments are spent on what purpose

for the black people of Rehoboth. For
virtually every need, such as the
moving of black people, they got
money from the central government,
but instead used it for the develop.
ment of the Basters and in so doing,
perpetrating the squatter status of
the black people in the area.

On the question of the presence of
black people in this Gebiet, which is

wrongly understood, | would like to
say the following: we are in this
Gebjet to stay, forever. It is our right
to be here, it ia not a favour from the

of anyone else. The Basters

once again take note that the
present Rehoboth history is being
written by the Bastera for the

Basters, and is not recognised y US. .
, Basters should also take note that.

‘we first requested fair and

THE black people of Rehoboth —

for each black resident of this area,
in order to ‘squat’ legally in these
places, but we are no longer in-
terested in a few hectares: we want
the land of our forefathers.

The socalled support of the black
people. We would like to see the
Baster government hold a meeting in
Block E in order to establish what
the black people think of them.

The referendum. Like other Nami-
bians, we look forward to the result
of the proposed referendum, because
in this manner we wil] get a clear pic-
ture of where the Basters stand in
regard to the rest of Namibia. We ex-
pect the whole world to keep an eagle
eye on the proposed referendum.

The Basters of this country must
take note that any law applied in the
Rehoboth Gebiet, must be announc-
ed at a policy meeting, where they
establish what policy should be
followed and that everyone is guilty
of the socalled vaderlike wette and at-
tention 18 given to the official oppres-
sion of the Basters, under which the
black people suffer.

‘With the proposed referendum
each Baster wil! be asked what his
attitude is towards the other in-
habitants of this country.

One thing is certain - as certain as
the sun which rises in the east - an
election will come in this country,
and the Basters will want to
negotiate.

ACCORDING to a report published
in the Republikein of March 6 1987,
interim government Minister, An.
dreas Shipanga, ‘sharply criticised’
and expressed his ‘disappointment’
about certain statementa the Vicar
General of the Roman Catholic
Church, Father Bernhard Nor-
dkamp, had allegedly made during
an address given at a youth seminar,
which, again according to the report,
is said to have been organised by the
Council of Churches. The report
relates to what Mr Shipanga 1s alleg.
ed to have said during a meeting of

the National Assembly on March 5

1987.

Mr Shipanga, according to the
report, bases his claim about what

the Vicar General had said during

the youth seminar held at Dobra, on

a letter by an unidentified “Win-

~ dhoek student'’ which letter was
- published in the Windhoek Observer

of February 28, 1987. The “student”
alleges, inter alia, that Father Nor-

- dkamp had said that “law and order
are sin”. For the purposes of this

statement it is sufficient to state that
the letter contains further very
serious distortions and outright un-
truths. It represents nothing but a
very ill-considered attempt to amear
the Roman Catholic Church and to
discredit the Vicar General, whose
commitment to bringing about
justice with peace in a truly Chris-
tian society in Namibia is well

| known

Against this background, Mr
Shipanga's criticism ie evidently un-

| warranted and uncalled for. Yet Mr

Shipanga, who holds hia high office
by virtue of an appointment by the
Routh African Government, sean fit

to simply repeat these untrue allege:
tions of what the Vicar General is

taken to have said, relying on
nothing more than an anonymous |

Cabinet minister can simply accept
serious allegations without further
verification. Mr Shipanga’s failure to
check his facta is even more frighten-
ing in view of the extremely wide ar-
bitrary executive powers which are
vested in him. and his colleagues in
the Cabinet of the interim govern-
ment by virtue of numerous socall-
ed security laws, which would clear-
ly require the greatest measure of —
restraint and responsibility. These
laws not only offend against fun.
damental human rights, but alsoin- |
vite serious abuses of due process and |
the Rule of Law. .

It is most disturbing that Mr
Shipanga, at the taxpayer's expense,
and protected by a statutory immuni-
ty against possible legal action,
repeats unchecked allegations by an
obecure letter writer and then, on the
basis of those slanderous allegations
proceeds to ‘sharply’ criticise a senior
and respected Priest of the order of
the Oblates whose dedication
towards the protection of Christian
values in this territory can hardly be |
questioned. !

Mr Shipanga has chosen Father |
Nordkamp as a target of severe |
criticism. At the same time Mr |
Shipanga however chooses to remain
silent about the Police’s admission
under oath in the Heita trial present-
ly before the Windhoek Supreme
Court, presenting a picture of brutal
violations of the most elementary
human rights and an alarming
disregard for law and order by the
police. : -

WE HAVE read, with interest, a letter
received from Minister Kozonguizi
typed on a letterhead of the Depart
ment of Information, indicated that
even such letters are done at the tax
payer's expense

Minister Kozonguizi’s epistle is
what hecallsa “review” ofour booklet

“The Choice - Namibia Peace Plan
435 or Socrety under Siege”

The booklet attempts to present
Namibians with the facts and by the
proviston of these facts and the
analysts of these facts, to strengthen
the commitment of ali these who call
for immediate impiementation of
Resolution 435 of 1975

Itconstitutes analysis as weil asad

tion of facts by the Honourable
Minister and all those institutions,

mouthpieces with whom the

closely associated

It presents the truth in rebuttal of
the propaganda daily poured out for
Mr Kozonyuizi s cause and financed by
millions. if not billions of Rand from
the pockets of the South African and
Namibia taxpayers, andin the case of
Namibia without the consent of the
taxpayers and without the consent of
Namibians

quately in our booklet and readers are
referred to it

We can all agree thata constitution
isone ofthe most important pillars of
a stable democratic state -1f not the
very foundationof it, But surely such
an important basic document must
represent the will of the people of
Namuibra otherwise it will have to be
imposed andthenit will not be worth
the paper on which it is written To
represent the will of the people, it
follows that only truly elected
representatives of the people can
represent the will of the people

Andtoelect such representatives of
the people who will thendraw upacon
stitution for Namibia. in the exercise
of their self-determination and right
to independence, 1s the very aim and
essence of Resolution 435 of 1978

After the constitution so drawn up by
the elected representatives, there
could be a further election forthe first
government of Namibia in terms ofthe
agreed constitution That willineffect
meanaconstitution before anclection
for a Namibian government

In the case of Namibia. however.
there already exists an international
ayreement.on the inclusion of certain
specified constitutional principles and
fundamental human rights in the
future constitution of Namibia and
also safeguards for the protection of
minorities in the form ofa provision for
proportional representation and for
the further details of the constitution
to be decided upon by at least a two
thirds majority

So itis clear that even here a com-
promise hus already been reached
between those who want a constitution
first and those who want an election
before a constitution

Swapo hasconsistently stood by the
peace plan and the democratic elec:
tions provided for in it, whereas
Minister Kozonguiz:. Minister
Shipanga and others show no sign of
suggesting anv sort of country-wide
elections to legitimise their appoint
ments by the SA Government Have
vou redefined democracy, Minister
Kozonguizi? If 30, please let the ‘in
telligent” readers have vour definition
and your government's planof action
for democracy. self-determination and
internationally recognised
independence.

If vour vague allegations ayainst
Swapo ure trut, you should welcome
elections in termsof Resolution 435 of
1978 because then vou can attack and
denigrate Swapo in their presence in
front of the Namibian people The
peace plan provides for the return of al!
refugees and one can imayine the
many witnesses then becoming
available to substantiate these
charges. iftrue, Why miss such an ex
cellent opportunity to free the tortured
refayees and confront Swape face to

seem to be three (1) capitulation » by

may bow to fate by accepting the South
African settlers and abiding bv the dic
tates of the Pretorta government, (2)

negotiation - tn the hope that the SA
Government may modify its position
which would amount to capitulation:
(Srindifference inthe hope thatother
countries, other powers, may take up
their struggle and attain freedom for
them. None of these, especially the first,
seems very likely

The fourth 1s armed struggle
whichis alwayseasier todiscuss than
toplan, easertoorganise than to carry
out, for it must be pursued with
ruthless determination to win and
it must be reinforced by a principl-
ed dedication to the cause. From
thier public pronouncements, iLseems
clear that the leaders of South West
Africa are moving in the direction of
armed struggle”

ft appears that the Honourable
Minister has since 1966 accepted the
firstoption above viz “Capitulation. ”

What basis do Namibians have for
beheving that the interim government
willabide by whatever constitution it
might draw up, when itis responsible
tonoclectorate having never faced an
election?

Excuse of UN Partiality: We
acknowledge tn our booklet the fact of
UN partiality, but we explain whys it
will not have any effect on the judge
ment of Namibians ina 445 election
But why don't you acknowledge South
Africa’s partiality? Why not?

The Honourable Minister of Justice
has often inthe past reiterated thatin
Africa power comes from the barrel ot
agun, and we suspect that he and some
of his associates have accepted this
credo.

It seems futile to argue with the
Minister about free and fair elections
Ifinterested in elections at all.it will
have to be elections which he can be
guaranteed to win- and free and fair
elections are unlikely to lead to that
result

According to news reports around
25 000 people are benefiting from an
emergency feeding scheme. The
Department of National Health and
Welfare, and private welfare organiza-
tions, like the Red Crogs are involved.
While having sympathy with
hungry people, and supporting the ef:
forts to help, we have to ask ourselves,
“Why are these people starving”. The
following problems are contributing to
the problem viz:
A) Population Growth:
The annual population growth hovers
around three percent. Fifty percentof
the population is 15 years or younger,
and therefore unproductive. Between
© to 10 percent are retired and no
longer make a contribution. Present-
ly only 20 percent ofthe population are
gainfully economically employed, and
of this group, one quarter works for the
State. The balance 20-25% are either
subsistence farmers or unemployed.
The population growth ou tstrips
food production, housing resources,
schooling, Health services and job crea-
tion. As @ result the population
becomes poorer and poorer, and the
economically active group smaller in
proportion. It is always tempting in an
effort toredistribute wealth, to heavi-
ly tax this group. Care must however
be taken not tokill the goose that lays
the golden eggs.
B) Drought:
Namibia isasemi-desert country and
droughts are part of life. The problem
arises when the odd few good rainfal]
years are taken asthe norm and no pro-
vision is made for the inevitable bad
years in nature's cycle.
C) Farming Methods:
Farming methodsaresometimes very
destructive, especially in the com-
munal areas. There, no rotation graz-
ing is implemented and very little con-
trol is exercised over stock numbers.
Traditionally the number of cattle iB
a symbol of wealth, irrespective of their
condition. Owners are alsooften loathe
to sell their cattle, even in times of
drought, with resultant destruction of
grazing and death, as witnessed a few
years ago in Kaokoveld. The result ig
the same as in the Sahel region in
North Africa. Man has totally upset
the delicate balance of nature for short
term gain, with longterm destructive
results, |

D) Guerrilla War: | |

‘| avesult ofthe political uncertaintyiand —
BVO US SO

-D) Guerrilla War:

The war, especially in Owambo, con-
tributes tothe misery ofthe locals. As
-aresult ofthe political uncertainty and
‘lack of international recognition, in-
vestments are not readily made in
‘Namibia, with resultant meagre job
creation. The spill-over of the war in
Angola, streches our limited resources
with refugees.

E) Good Medica! Services:

As a result of good medical services
more people survive in an otherwise
often hostile environment. There isa
sense of fatalism and the beliefthat the
State will provide for all needs. This 1s
often demanded as a right which the
State has to satisfy. Unfortunately this
demand is not matched by responsibil.
ty or contribution. In order to try and
solve the problem, and to avoid an
ecological and biological disaster, the
problem must be tackled with political
will.

A) Population Planning:

Namibia isnyt arichcountry. Many of
its resources are transient cy.
diamonds(CDM), base minerals(TC1.),
uranium (Rossing), gas(KUDU), and
gold(Karibib). When the mines close,
this source of income is gone. The
resources remaining will be farming,
fishing, tourism and human. If the
human resource is planned and nur.

tured it will be the most important.

One Just has to look at Japan, a coun-
try with virtually no natura!
resources, but an incredible human
resource.

Due to the population explosion,
China has taken drastic steps aiming
at one child per family. Parents who
want more will have to pay and forfeit
free services and free schooling. This
may sound very radical but one hasto
he cruel to be kind. The alternative is
another Ethiopia. Here the initial
worldwide enthusiasm and Bob
eldoft waned as 400n as the TV im.
ages faded and aid mismanay
became known gement

Population planning can also not be
seen in the white/black political con-
text. Already blacks outnumber
whites by more than twelve to one.
Whether it is two to one or 12 to one
makes no difference in aone-manone-

~
*
vote election. Therefore population
planning as a form of imperialistic,
capitalistic, racial suppression, has no
logical or scientific basis.

With the present growth curve,
demands on health, housing, food,
education andemployment, are in ex:
cess of supply, and the situation is
worsening. Demand greater than
supply boosts inflation, whichinturn
aggravates poverty even further. It is
a vicious cycle. Only a firm political
statement of intent and action, can
break this cycle. It will require a brave
man to doit, but if successfull, he will
go down in history as the man who
brought progress and prosperity. Peo-
ple will become independent of, rather
than dependent on the State.

B) Farming Methods:

Farming methods must become scien-
tificand conservative. Namibia is vir-
tually only suited to livestock and
game farming. The delicate ecological
symbiosis must be nurtured for future
generations.

C) Political Settlement

’ (AG8 and Resolution 435):

The guerrilla war can only be ter-
minated by a political settlement. It is
often said that Namibia must decide
its own future, but to most who have
followed the political yo-yo game, it is
obvious that outside sources from a
number of sides are manipulating our
future. A settlement will hopefully
bring peace, stability, investment and
prosperity.

D) Good Medical Services:

Good medical services must gohandin |
hand with education and economic ©
progress.

E) Political Independence:

Political independence depends on
economic independence. Namibia’s
resources must be developed by Nami-
bians for Namibia, with help if
necessary. Presently symptoms and
not causes are treated. This only
postpones a solution until it becomes
insurmountable.

Man has been able to control all
other formsofliebut not himself. One
of the few people still inharmony with
nature is the Kalahari bushman. He
sets anexcellentexampleofliveand let
live, unlike the suicidal lemmings of
the Antarctic.

You don't help a poor man by giving
him a fish, but by showing him how to
catch a fish. The aim should be in-
dependence not hand-out nurtured
dependence.

OPEN LETTER TO
NOMTSOUB COUNCILLORS

THE CONSUMER boycott of the
white business urea froin the
mineworkers is in its sixth week on
Tsumeb.

Many of the white businessmen are
really feeling it now. because there
is nothing to keep the business run-
ning on.

For the attention of the General
Manager of the Mine (TCL) there are
certain workers demands, which 1n-
clude a call for an increase in
salaries. There ure ulso grievances
concerning the high taxes they pay;
and the war in the north.

The residents are supposed to put
their grievances to the Numtsoub
Community Councillors who were
never elected by the residents of the
town. The socalled Councillors
distribute some propaganda through
the Nomtsoub township as well as in
the workers’ hostel.

They say that we are ina free and
independent land. Please, Coun.
cillors, don’t mislead the people.
Think of what happens in the nor
thern part of our country. People are
suffering and innocent people are dy-
ing ut the hands of SADF and
Koevoet.

[t is our money we pay in taxes that
they use to buy Casspirs, to destroy
our lands, and perpetrate other
similar deeds.

Don't say the workers are wrong
because they are hoycotting the
white business area.

In those papers they distribute
among the Nomtsoub residents, they
try to use the people to inform the
police who are the culprits, to tell
people not to buy in the white area.

] AM not writing on behalf of black
nurses only buton behalfofall nurses,
irrespective of colour, because the nur-
sing profession knows no colour.
‘Disgusted’ of Katutura recently
wrote about one incident concerning
the profession, but not all of it. Let me
tell all Namibian taxpayers what they
pay for. The pay raise which has been
announced isnot s-lvingthe problem,
but is part of it.

Recently a groupof women from the
different communities came together
to consult with the nursing heads,
thinking that thay could help to iden;
tify the problems and at the same time
solve them, which was a good and
sound gesture. But instead of trying to
improve the situation, the nursing
heads felt that they stood
unreasonably accused, and wanted
names and dates when the incidents
happened.

Isay that ‘silence never won rights’
There are those of us who sat at that
meeting and took note of what was —
said. But how are we to improve condi-
tions when there were posts advertis-
ed almost a year ago and so far we have
heard nothingabout them. Insteadin
the latest hospital news brief, we read
of someone who is being moved from
one high post to another. Nothing
advertised. Where does the post sud-
denly come from? The joke is that the
person who has been appointed has to
be taught by the old staff. The post she
has left has to wait for another
‘favourite friend’ in order to be filled?

If the senior structure is not right,
then what motivation is there for the
rest of the personnel to be faithful?
What areall the sisters doing in the of-
fice - why must they all be doing
statisticsand filing? Why can'tclerks
be employed, and let the nurses do nur-
sing tasks.

The nursing care on the wards is not
up to scratch. So Mrs Barlow, take a
hint and do something to improve the
situation. Do you need all those nurses
around your office?

There is another incident about
which all nurses are aware: sometime
last year asenior retired nurse was ad-
mitted to hospital for » major opera-
tion, and two days after the operation
she wasatill lying therein her theatre
gown, not in the best of health. How
does that sound? It is not only the per-
son in the street who suffers, but ‘old

nurses’ too.

Please do something about this
situation. Reduce the number of

nurses around you, Mrs Barlow, you
don’t need them all for moral support.

1 AM a regular reader of your paper,
feeling the need to be broadly inform:
ed- alsoon issues and events which are
often neglected or distorted by other

papers.

Lwas quite shocked though, when be-
ing confronted with your article
“Trophies and the Hunted’ by M Ver.
baan and the editorial ‘A threatened
lifestyle (Both in The Namibian of Oc-
tober 16).

These two contributions to the topic
of Bushmanland appear s0 superficial
and without any background know.
ledge by the writers that I feel obliged
tocomment The only purpose of the
said contributions seems to be one of
sensationaliam and propagandism
aimed at belittling and degrading the
interim government - at the cost of
sound reporting on the Bushmans’
plight and the different possible and
realistic alternatives.

Though | share your views on the il
legitimacy of the interim government
and on soonest implementation of in
ternattonally recognised in
dependence, I do not think that this
warrants bad journalism aiming at
political gain especially on a subpect
asimportant for partofthe Namibian
nation as thisone

In my opinion, the main statement
ls @ positive one, namely, that the
region will not be proclaimed a game
reserve Thisis what the argument was
going on about and what concerned
people had feared would happen Your
statement ‘the Cabinet are obvious
ly going to have to lure the prime
trophy animals such as lion and
elephant into Bushmanland’’ is quite
ndiculous. The ‘game such aslion and
elephant” are NOT '‘going to flock to
the area’’ as M Verbaan states, because
theese species are already abundantly
present in Bushmanland

This ia exactly the problem the
Bushmen are faced with al] the time!
The only possible solution would thus
seem a reduction in numbers by hun-
ting Possibly a very smal! percentage
could be jured out into Koudom game
reserve by additional water holes
there.

Now tothe y hunting, thiecer-
tainly does NOT imply “rifle toting
hunters” flooding the area every
season, or the “region to be inundated
by foreigners armed with highpowered
rifles, searchlights, jeeps and

landrovers”’

Trophy-hunting is a very
sophisticated form of hunting involv.

ing highly-skilled professional
hunters. trackers and camp staff, as
wellasskinners all usually well-paid
and good jobs. certainly not to be
sneered at the way you did in the
editorial

The “season” for trophy hunting
comprises virtually the whole vear. no
flood of rifle-toting hunters is involy-
edusis possible during our two month
“biltong hunting season” and no
spotlights are used whatsoever, as is
the case during the niyght-calliny
operations

This very individualised. exclusive
trophy -hunting reaultsinthe highest
income per hunted animal, while the
hunting operation itself is the best
paid tourrst activity in the country
and all this 1n foreign currency

lam stating these facts after nine
years’ experience ag a professtonal
hunting guide. Ihave also at the begin
ning of thik month. visited
Bushmanland for six daya: NOT toget
a hunting concession, but to inform
myself

During aconversation with Mr Mar-
shal} of the Bushman Foundation, he
himselfcalculated that the income for
one trophy elephant would pay forthe
installation of acomplete cattle drink.
ing point - LIF the income goes to the
benefit of the Bushmen. And this, I
believe, isthe point where work hasto
be done - namely to ensure proper
distribution ofthe income generated,
#0 an to benefit the Bushman
population.

Asfar asl know, Mr Hartung, he too
would see this matter in the same
light, and I would in general agree
with you that - ifsolittle consultation
with the population and the experts
has taken place - this isnot acceptable,
though this does not at the eame time
make the decision takan a bad one.

It certainly isabetter solutionthan
the practice inb the ‘good old days’
when one of the present day interim
government ministers took it upon

himselfto “freethe population of such
problem animals” on taxpayers’ ex
pense by shooting from an army

Would anyone whois really serious

portant?’ Eis visit was as fruitless as
the recent recent of the men in suits

actions after classes and work? Or
short stay-awavys of fifteen minutes at

donate a part of those earnings into a

occupation of Namibia costs millions
aday but no money is available for the
implementation of the peace plan.

Namibia have been increased time and

available. And in all this, Namibians
had no say, they only paid taxes.

Little to fear

THE RECENT Lusaka conference
eeems to have been a big succeas. Cer.
tainly, that was the sentiment of the
SWAPO statement, as well asthe view
of most participants, who attended the
conference. But was it, really? We do
not profess to know. We were not there,
and, apart from what little informa-
tion appeared about it :n ‘The Nami-
bian’ of the 21 October, we have very iit-
tle information about what was
discussed. Perhaps somebody will soon
write some more about it!

However, the Lusaka conference pro-
vides a good starting point to remind
ourselves again of the socialist objec.
tives of a future Swapo government.
And let us make it clear at the outset,
that our allegiance lies within that
broad movement, as the only move.
ment, truly and realistically express.
ing national aspirations at the mo.
ment. But that support could never be
unconditional. There is too much at
stake for that to happen.

Article 111(7) & (8)of the Constitu.
tion, states that a Swapo government
would “exercise effective control over
the major means of production and
distribution, and work towardsanon-
exploitative and non-oppressive
classless society’’ No doubt it should
sound sensible for most businessmen
in Namibia to want to trade off some
of the huge profits they are making at
the moment in return for political
stability and international accep-
tance. But how much would they real-
ly be willing to give up within the
broad concept of Article 111? A pro-
greasive tax rate of up to 60% or more?

~But rather let us be clear about the
kinds of benefits the suffering Nami-
bian masses should, and ought, to ex-
pect from a socialist government, after
this long and arduous struggle.
1. SOCIALSERVICES: This isan area
under which some ‘socialist countries’,
eg. the USSR, and some mixed
economies, ag Sweden's appear to
have done vies It may be argued
however, that we do not live in Europe,
bateven

by the regime to the south of them.
There is indeed, no reason why the
Namibian working claas should notex-
pect the right toa minimum wage, the
right to work, to full employment,
health, free education. relatively free
travel, and accomodation. Unlessone
is led to believe in the propaganda of
the very people who have led a policy
of creating a dependent and exploited
economy, the availability of those basic
services, at least in the ameliorated
sense that workers are guarenteed in-
dome by the state that willensurethem
access to these basic neccesities,
should be something of a medium., if
not immediate-term objective, of the
future people’s government. Indeed
with a population of about 1,5 million
people, and with the country’s
argricultural, mining and fishing
potential, together with the potential
in under-developed processing in-
dustries, the prospect of Namibia
feeding itself is, in the sense describ-
ed, not a mere pie-in-the-sky notion.
Such prospects must be a lure to the
skilled labour forced in particular, to
remain even after independence.
However, those expectations might
have to be adjusted and related to the
extent to which they are willing to

_ allow citizens to share the country's

resources.

2. MARKET FORCES: These lead to
unequal distribution of wealth and
power, and are therefore essentially
unacceptable in contravening Article
111. However we may need to be
pragmatic. It may he argued, quite
reasonably, that, without paying our
way through the world market, our
economy might stagnate, or even

pase
lo Hencethe Namibian worker
aay have to:accept a lower wage to
‘enable our products to sell com.
petitively at international levels, and
to attract foreign investment. This
may well be true. But, attheendofthe
day, the issue ia often a political one,
and, with international acceptance, a
‘Swapo government may wellbe ableto
negotiate favourable quotas and terms
of trade with bodies such as the EEC
and various governments, including
the so called ‘Third World’ countries.
It is, of course, also true that the deci-
sion to be made is essentially one of
deciding what social costs we are
prepared to pay for the sake of ‘develop-
ment’. And, as has already been in-
dicated; we do not believe that that
price has to be very high.

It is also perhaps, here that indepen-
dent trade unions might havearoleto
play in safeguarding workers’ in-
terests. But, and this is, of course,
again, a controversial issue, we may
have to steer clear of ‘ultra-leftist’
trades unions. Not that there is
anything wrong with such trades
unions in principle. But the idea that
blocking, say, the sale of Namibian
uranium, will bring the international
capitalist system crumbling down, or
export revolutions to other countries,
seems, inthe currentclimate, at best,
idealistic, but could involve tremen-
dous social and economic cost on the
part ofasmal! nation that hasalready
had more than its fair share of suffer-
ing under the status quo.

3. DEMOCRACY: Mr. Geingob is
reported in ‘The Namibian’ to have
paid that ‘There cannot be democracy
only at the expense of the majority, and
a Swapo government will extend

E sill people. That is basically Article
; 1116) af the constitution, and, in the

world of ‘perestroika’ and ‘power tothe

‘Certainly, Swapo has very little to
. Bar from democracy, either now, or im-
oe eeaeans

eanndin.

toall spheres of life, and for.

doctrination and, with the -ses-¢
capitalist values in which we are swint
ming worldwide, the potential {is
strong for reactionary forces te
manipulate the scene. Hence the im-
portance that may, perhaps, have tobe
placed upon responsible media and a
comprehensive educational system.
Freedom of the press, and open govern-
ment are principles that we all sup-
port, but they must be balanced
against society's interest in informed,
as opposed to misinformed, decision
making. Certainly, whilst the racist
regime in the south prevails, these in-
terests might have to be carefully
balanced. What we could certainly not
afford to do, is to let working people suf-
fer so much for independence and
freedom, and then extend the existing
life of concrete reality ina camouflag-
ed form.

IN SUMMARY: It has not been the ob-
jective of this brief article to criticise
what was said, or not said, at the
Lusaka conference. Indeed, the con-
ference was a significant and welcome
political development. Rather, our at-
tempijhas been merely to restate and
keep alive the debate as to the road to
socialist development for Namibia,
after independence. In view of the
debate raging in ‘socialist countries’
atthe moment, tothe extent that some
leading personalities are reported to
have questioned the wisdom of the
revolutions that took place there at all,
as wel] as welcoming extreme right
wing political leaderstoexpound their
obnoxious philosophies to their people,
it is important, even more go for us in
Namibia, toopen up as many areasas
possible for debate - now.

PLEASE allow me a space in the

Administration.

apparently aimed at the furtherdnce
of National Party’ policies, on a
monthly basis. No black man attends
theese meetings.

Presently the situation in Caprivi
allows for taxation of Caprivians and
not whites as the latter claim that
Act 2 of 1974 is applicable to Caprivi-
ans only. The 8A Government has
done nothing to repeal this legisla-
tion.

Caprivian officials pay one per
cent of their income (monthly), in
addition to the general tax payable to
the Receiver of Revenue. A surpris-
ing fact is that there are_no income
tax returns handed to taxj;ayers as is
habitual with the Receiver of Reve-
nue. It is disturbing too, to find that
the following people do not pay this
(one percent) tax: all Caprivians
employed by other government de-
partments and/or private inetitu-
tions; all whites and non-Caprivians
employed by the Administration; all
tribal indunas; general dealers and
traders in the area.

] wish to call on progressive Ca-
privi Administration officials to re-
ject this uncalled-for tax. This act of
the colonisers should be viewed seri-
ously and the nominated Executive
Committee abolished with immedi-
ate effect. It has failed to satisfy the
wishes of the people aa it is only
dancing to the tune of its masters
(the whites). How can they allow
Caprivians to be milked by theese
people?

This legislation should be tested in
a court of law.

In addition the whites in the area
are presently trying to separate
Caprivi from the rest of progressive
Namibia. The suffering of Caprivi is
largely due to the fact that the area is
used as a dumping ground for whites
who have failed to make the grade
elsewhere.

Lastly I want to call on the intell!-
gentaia in the region to mobiles
people for independence. No other
region in Namibia hae a ‘white godfa-
ther’ like in Caprivi. Come, one and

‘A sensitive nerve

Indeed Mr Shipanga's ‘New Year's
Message’ touched a sensitive nerve
in me, especially with the untruths
and political dishonesty that ‘mes-
sage’ displayed.

In his article (27/01/89) Mr Shipanga
implies that because Father Wolfe
had said that ‘‘reconciliation of the
Namibian people as a whole is needed
before we can become one Namibia
one Nation’’, then anybody who uses
the word ‘reconciliation’ on televi-
sion must go unchecked. Mr Shipanga,
reconciliation is not merely an event
- it is a process in which not only
what we say, but also what we do,
will determine the essence of our
determination.
~ So do not think that people will
believe your sincenty because you
use the words ‘peace’ and ‘reconcili-
ation’, even more so when your frame
of reference is artificial: (that your
TGNU protected the rights of Na-
mibians during the past. three-and-a-
half years).

| maintain, Mr Shipanga, that your
Cabinet sided with the South Afncan
‘government in trying to stop duc
legal process, and I add that all this
was done at the expense of the tax-
payers, Please say this is not true, and
tell the Namibian people what posi-
tion did you take, and what you as
Cabinet did in the interest of due
legal process in the iste Wapota and
| *Shifidi cases.

Taleo maintain that national cam-
paigns and international diplomatic
- gnd economic pressure forced the |
ence.

a) National campaigns:

- When the churches marched on
_ the side of the poor (Corpus Chnst)
gangs from some government circles
could not stop them. When Kameeta
gave that emouonal address at St
Andrews in Khomasdal, the people
were moved to action, and more
Koevoet was armed and deployed on
the strects of Katutura

- When Swapo held a public rally
after five years of silence, fifteen
thousand people came. Apartheid
shivered in Namibia and police and
army tactics were adjusted as evident
in the circumstances surrounding the
death of Shifidi.

- When concerned namibians as-
sisted workers to bind together in
defence of their rights, their lives, -
an action which culminated in the —
organised workers movement sec- —
ond to none in the history of Namibia —
- your Cabinet moved in with bills to —
serve that initiative a death —

blow, and thanks to, yes, national
r | iy 1
law, and it was thus stillbom, re-
member? Remember the ILO expen-
ence when your cabinet was trying to
Jobby against the Namibian workers
for fear of ‘political manipulation’?
All your actions did not succeed be-
cause the workers were always astep
ahead of your cabinet.

Mr Shipanga, if this is not ‘na-
tional campaigns , what is?

(b) International campaigns:

Well, inthe interest of spacc I shall
not dwell, because after all itis obvi
OUuS:

- thatitis because of intemational
diplomatic and economic pressure
on the government in South Africa
that your TGNU was not recognised
by a single country as such.

- that the South Afncan Rand has
and continues to plunge, to the extent
thal (as you correcuy pomt out) South
Afnca had to recognise that it cannot
continue to enforce her preferences
through intermediaries of her unilat-
eral choice; and that the cost of re-
taining control has come to, and in
fact has long exceeded, the benefit.

It is in this Context interesting to
note what South African Minister of
Finance, Barend du Plessis, said in a
recent interview in Leadership (a South
African journal),

Mr du Plessis was asked a question
on sanctions and he said: (paraphrased)
the question of sanctions is rather
delicate to discuss because, if you
say they are not working, you are
inviting more; and if you say they are
working, you are inviting more.

This | think is indicative of inter-
national diplomatic and economic
| pressure on South Africa. Suffice it
| to quickly add that national and in-
- termational campaigns are necessar-
ily complementary.

Finally I am surprised that Mr
Shipanga only now sees it fittomvite
me to join hands with other Namibi-
ans to build the son of country of
which we can all be proud, while he
knows that it was my commitment
all along. |

Mr Shipanga knows that when he

average monthly rental for these prop-
erues wes R1995, approximately two
third of my net salary.

I would hope to find a three-
bedroomed house with a small gar-

two children and two dogs. The cheap-

cording to the agents, would still
have absorbed more than half my

further reduce my income after ex-

Some ex-combatants have not yet
acquired jobs. Many have lost their

them. Our education system has to
continue to support racists and auto-

so as to retain their jobs, all for the
sake of reconciliation. Is’ ‘reconcill-
ation’’ the reason for these high sala-
nes?

It seems that we are not only
“reconciling’’ with ex-colomal

them. Our leaders preached equ ality,

ufect that CDM and other companies

Therefore the company conmmuit-
ted untold unforgivable and unfor-
gettable contraventions such as over-
mining and transfer pncing.

Furthermore, de Beers, the owners
of CDM, have created a number of
subsidiaries that held onto mining
and prospecting nghts and the fees
paid to them are set against tax.

One subsidiary, the Manne Dia-
mond Corporation, leased to CDM
several prospecting and mining ar-
eas along the Atlantic Coast.

Itisclearthat this deal was made to
avoid paying tax. This is a grossly
unpatnotic act and amounts to eco-
nomic sabotage in our country. It is
also designed to prevent economic
growth.

In theory CDMs operations were/
are overseen by the socalled Dia-
mond Board of SWA, which advised

the South African Administrator

General. However, he himself dis-

covered that the Board nover had’
physical control of the diamonds.

All inspections and supervisions
were done by CDM, mostly white
South Africans, who parcelled up the
diamonds and despatched them to
Kimberley, where they were valued
by de Beers officials and not Namibi-
ans.

The Goverment must not be misled
by CDM into thinking that it is its
employees who are ‘stealing’ the
diamonds.

If diamonds are being stolen, per-
haps it is also whites who are not
searched. The security men who work
at the gate on the Namibian/South
African border are whites, and some
of them live at Alexander Bay. They
are not Namibians and they often
search only blacks while whites are
given the green light.

It is also an insult that the people
who control entry into Oranjemund
are ¢x CDM shop assistants, mostly
females from South Africa.

Lastly, instead of CDM asking its
employees to hand in stolen diamands
from 23 to 29 August, they them-
selves mist hand in diamonds which
are kept in Kimberley and London.

THE sight of a dreadfully drunk and
miserable woman in Gobabis Road
recently drew the attention of motor-
ists who had to swerve their cars;

destrians’ simplistic reaction was
either to laugh or shake their heads.

Alcoholism is the worst social
problem in Namibia and of course it
ig linked to factors such as poverty.

While problem drugs such as
Mandrax attract more of a sensation,
there’s a far easier means {0 contnb-
ute to solving part of the problem
they present: ‘Pushers’ all over the
world know perfectly well that they
can ruin their lives having to serve
stiff jail sentences if caught and found
guilty.

But because liquor is so socially
acceptable, no one thinks of those
who sell it as people who share the
same responsibility for social miser-
ies as drug peddlars.

1 would be most surprised if sell-
ing liquor does not carry one of the
highest profit margins for formal and
informal entrepreneurs in southem
Afnca.

How about a tax being charged on
every drop of liquor which lines these
merchants’ pockets to sponsor a
rehabilitation centre for Namibians
unable to cope with alcoholism?

And let’s face it, a broad range of
people can be victims of alcoholism:
from shanty-dwellers in Damaraland
to inhabitants of posh Ludwigsdort.

If owners of licenced bottle store
outlets claim that informal ‘cucas’
and tombo sellers are equally re-
sponsible - tombo is frequently made
from powder which originates from
licenced shops with books to which
the Ministries of Finance and Health

NYANGO (ZAMBIA)

On car abuse

of Wednesday, October 24, in which
he/she implied that the abuse of
government vehicles was the *‘order
of the day’ in the past and that it
went unchecked and unnoticed.
The implication in the letter was
also that the abuse of government
vehicles is no worse than in the past
and that the numerous complaints
arise out of resentment that ‘blacks
are driving luxury vehicles’.
I can tell Mr/Mrs FPP that in the
in which I work there
was (and still is) very strict control
over the use of State vehicles.

I WAS amazed to read ‘FPP’s' letter

The use ofa govemment vehicle as
transport to and from home was (and
stillis) strictly forbidden. The idea of
using a government vehicle for a
shopping tnp as one frequently sees
nowadays was completely out of the
question.

When I was shopping on Saturday
October 6, there were at least four
‘D...T' Toyota Landcmuisers parked
in the Wembhil car park. Whatever
Mr/Mrs FPP nught think, this type of
blatant nususe of our (as taxpayers)
property did not happen in the past,
and certainly not in the recent plus-
minus five years.

I am really not concerned with
whether the current offenders are
black or white, but [ am concerned
that taxpayers such as myself are
paying for the use of government
vehicles in flagrant violation of regu-
lations, which for some reason are
not being enforced in certain govern-
ment departments.

I appreciate that many civil ser-
vants are not able to afford to buy a
car for transport to and from work,
and that public transport in Wind-
hock is woefully inadequate.

Would it not then be a better idea
for departments to look at the possi-
bility of a bus/minibus collection
service instead of using countless
fuel-guzzling four-wheel dnve ve-
hicles to transport civil servants to
and from their place of work?

scandalous
accusation

! MY attention is drawn to the letter
| entitled ‘Foreigner’s woes’ by acer-
tain Mrs Cox of Olympia which
appeared in The Namibian of No-

vember 19,

Mrs Cox claims to have come to
Namibia six months ago with ‘'the
intention of establishing a legitimate
business’’. She was however, sur-
pnsed to have been told to call back
after three months for the work per-
mit which she is yet to receive.

Mrs Cox also put several questions
to the readers, such as:

- she does not know the reason for
the duration required for the process-
ing of passportfeitizenship documents.

| According to her three months is too

, long and extensions if necessary, are

, Not acceptable to her.

| 7 Mrs Cox does not teel officers of

_ the Ministry of Home Affairs have

| | —_ .

; accordance with their job descrip-
hon, whether such information is
contained in the application forms or
not:

- she felt the Ministry is practising
delaying tactics and wants the Minis-
ter of Home Affairs to ‘call his offi-
cals to order’,

| According to her, Namibians were
not treated in the same way in her
country which she has not named.

These scandalous accusations di-
rected against our Govemment and
our law enforcement agency cannot
go unchallenged.

First of all, the socalled Mrs Cox

""failed to state her full name and address,

her country of origin and the type of

business she wants to undertake in

Namubia.

Secondly, official documents are
not just dished out anyhow, espe-
cially to foreigners, whether it be
passport, identity card, citizenship,
residential and work permits (that
may be done in the country Mrs Cox
comes from), ,

permanent residence or citizenship,

facilities.

These foreigners who do not ac-
cept that it is the prerogative and
nght of our government to contact
the affairs of the country the way
they see fit, are free to leave or not to
come here at all.

1 wonder if there is no more space
or change for the ‘establishment of a
‘egitimate business’ in the country
Mrs Cox comes from.

The occupation of our country lasted
105 years, while the war lasted about
23 years. With our independence we
have inhented a lot of pmblems which
our government is working day and
mght to resolve.

Our people are patient enough:
who 1s Mrs Cox not to be patient and
wait as required. Does she know that
not all Namuibians have passponss,
identity cards or birth certificates?

Or does she think the officials are
only employed to issue her work
permit. Please cool down Mrs Cox.

The other item of misleading in-
formation presented by her is the
allegations that Namibians were not

treated like that in the country she
comes from.
_ Which country is that? It must be

Some are thieves and crooks and

are fools who do not know what we
are doing, and anyone who wants to
make a fortune can come to Namubia.

I want to wam these foreigners”
who want to stay in our country to
behave accordingly. They should
respect our laws; stop interfenng in
our politics and bear with us: we have
difficulties and they should help us
to build the country and not to de-
stroy it.

Tam also calling onthe Ministry of
Home Affairs to tighten our border
controls to prevent people who do
not want to respect our laws from
coming here.

It is also important to review work
pemuts, residence documents and to
control the issuing of identity cards
and passports which are already in
the possession of foreigners.

The Ministry must also make a
distinction between the genuine po-
litical refugees who should be as-
sisted; gemmine businessmen who want
to invest; and fortune seekers and
other refugees should be repatriated
to their own countnes.

We fought for this country and no
one should insult us or tell us how to
conduct our affairs. Mrs Cox must be
shown the way and go and do what
she wants in her own country.

I WISH to react to the speech deliv-

ered by the Swapo head and chief

coordinator, Moses Garocb, at a Swapo

Youth League seminar in Katutura

on December I.

The theme of the semunar was
‘Multi-party democracy in Namibia
and the role of the youth’. MrGaroeb
made a strong speech to the more
than 500 young people who gathered
in the community centre hall.

The speech, among others, con-

! centrated on the future prospects of
democracy in the country. He in
particular spoke out about the fair-
ness of the last elections in the coun-
try, which he said was full of decert
and ngging which resulted in Swapo
losing the two-thirds majonty.

The Swapo leader pointed out that
the failure to obtain the two third
majonty was due to the fact that
many foreigners were brought in from
South Africa and Angola to vote for |
the DTA and other political parnes.
This practice, he said, would not be
repeated in the next national election |
scheduled for 1995.

In this context, Garoeb called on
all Swapo members to work hard
politically in order to out-wit other
parties, in particular, the DTA, at the
polls, and gain atwo thirds majonty.

Well and good, this is the verdict
that all Swapo members will work
hard from now on to ensure an elec-
tion victory for Swapo in the next
general elections.

But there are several factors which
may still prevent Swapo from ob-
taining the deserved two thirds ma-
jority, if the leadership of the party
don’t start looking seriously into the |
problems facing the nation and in
particular, workers, supporters and
sympathisers of Swapo.

The reality is that on the ground
today many people, members and
supporters who voted the party into
power, are becoming disillusioned
with the manner in which different
Swopo leaders are looking at the
probleme facing the nation.

While no doubt is expressed about
the capabilities of the Swapo leaders
and functionaries to change the status
quo, one cannot ignore the fact that
most of our leaders are atil! enjoying
their independence haneymoon and
time is passing us by.

duced to boost the war machurery of

This ruthless exptoitation of our
people by the colomial regime was at
the time understandable. Bul now
that Namibia is free and the war is
ended, we see no reason why his
heavy tax should continue unabated.
We do understand the concem of the
government to generae funds through
revenue, but this should not be done
through open and blatant exploita-
tion.

This is my view will only enhance
tho system of the rich getting richer
and the poor getting poorer. Whar the

maintain personal income tax and

abolish avertime super tax and gen-

While we all agree with the fact
thatthe Government has only been in

the vear 1991 must be a year of

The immigration issue is also sen-
ous, and the Home Affairs Munustry

Women on tax

I WOULD like the Finance
Minister, Dr Otto Herngel, to
clanfy a few points concem-
ing the article “Women to benefit
from tax changes’ in The
Namibian of Monday January
27.

The article said that there
will be changes in the current
discriminalion against women,
particularly mamed women.
My questions are:

- why is the emphasis only
on mamed women? Is is be-
cause unmamied women do not
pay taxes or is it because they
are not discnminated against?

- why should married women
be singled out as victims of
discrimination and what is the
case with unmarried women in

this regard?

THE budget debate is still on
in our National Assembly so
that my suggestion conceming
the paymem of income tax
remains relevant.

It was quite ironical to hear
Finance Minister, Dr Herrigel,

ing remarks in his budget
speech about closing the loop-
boles in the system of taxing
perks which salary camers
receive.

Who gets more perks than
the Honourable Minister and
his fellow members of the Na-
tional Assembly and they do
not even pay tax on their large
income.

This is what ! find lacking in
the socalled debate about the
beg e Assembly. People

themselves on the
and congratulating the
Finance Minister about a sup-

posedly progressive budget,
instead of addressing the bum-
ing problem that they, like the
Pharisees in Biblical times,
“bind heavy burdens, hard to
bear, and lay them on people's
shoulders, but they themselves
will not move them with their
finger’' (Mathew 23:4).

I ask simply and humbly that
our National Assembly lIcgis-
late that they themselves, who,
after all, eam more than any-
body else, pay income tax an
their salaries and perks.

It is no excuse that it is re-
garded as tradition worldwide
that members of governments
donot pay taxes. It isa mark of

true leadership that those in
ae should not require
of their subjects anything which
they are not prepared to do or
give themselves.

Let Namibia become an
example to governments the
world over thal we are a truce

democracy oven in this respect.
IL ‘s only when the minister of
finance of a country and his
peers in government are sub-
ject to the same obligations as
other citizens of that country
that they will be sensitive to
the problems and needs of their
fellow citizens.

I hereby invite other con-
cemed Namibians to take up
this debate in this newspaper
so that it will hopefully be-
come a concern for our gov-
emment.

‘Special’
branch?

IN THE Namibian police we
have what is called a ‘special
branch’. Though I know the
meaning of the words “spe-
cial’ and ‘branch’, I fail to
understand what type of job

they are entrusted to fulfil by
the Government.

I would like to ask both
Minister Hifekepunye Pohamba

a or aL

¢ve what the job of the ‘special

branch’ ia?

The ‘special branch’ as I came
to know it, has a history which
is wellknown in this country.
[tis known because ofits noto-
riety, something like that of
Koevoei. Yet today the ‘spe-
cial branch’ continues to exist
and is the more privileged
section of the Namibian po-
lice.

Formerly they used to inter-
rogate captured guernilas, spy
on Swapo and quell Swapo

 mectings. What is their task

now? To quel) what? To pro-
tect the state? Have tncy changed
colours?

All you see now ts these
people driving their Ford Sier-
ras and Landcruisers in the
streets of Windhoek and other
towns.

It seems that they are not

, affected by the recent circular

of Deputy Inspector General
Andima which prohibits any
police car to be used for pn-
vate purpose £.

I, as a member of the Na-
mubian police, and a taxpayer,
am not satisfied with the fac.
that this ‘special branch’ stiil
exists.

If its continued existence
cames the approval of the
authonities, then its perform-
ances must be reviewed and
amended or terminated if their
job has ended.

The hard-working uniformed
members of the police walk
many kms in distance to work
and home, while those elite
policemen pass them by in their
Landcnuisers.

What are they doing that is
#0 important that they are even

allowed to park their cars at
home?

was under the impression that
the government didn't have
money to throw around!

The report states that “the-
road improvements will knock
time off the tedious journey to
the airport”. Are we, as a de-
veloping country, with a des-
perate shortage of fundamen-
tal facilities such as schools
and hospitals, really able to
justify spending millions of
Rands merely to relieve a few
privileged people of a little
frustration?

It is interesting to look care-
fully at exactly the sort of time
that is going to be saved by the
road improvements. For the
forty kalometres from the
Windhoek city limits to the
airport, the youmey takes 30 |
minutes at an average speed of |
SOkm/hr. Were improvements
to make it possible to dnve at

A much cheaper solution to

leave home six minutes earlier

Reply to the Rev. S J Titus’
letter in The Namibian, 3 June
1991, and the letter by Mr Johan
Pretorius of Keetmanshoop
published on 12 July:

Firstly, the letter by Rev S J
Titus stated ‘‘that the Honour-
ner

able Minister of Finance and

tis fellow members of the
National Assémbly do not pay
tax on their large incomes”’.

Members of the Cabinet and
National. Assembly are NOT
exempt from the payment of

income tax on their salanes

and fringe benefits, and this
statement by the Reverend
therefore has no substance. Only
a marginal portion of the sala-
ries of Cabinet members are
exempt from income tax, which
must be seen in the light of the
services they render in the
fulfilling of their duties and
ultimate responsibility to the
Republic of Namibia and its
people.

The letter by Mr Johan Pre-
torus from Keetmanshoop
states that he fully agrees with
the views of the Reverend Th-
tus and the above answer to the
letter by Rev Titus would there-
fore also apply. Mr Pretorius,
however, goes further and cnt-
cises the current income tax
system, mainly in respect of
the tranferability of abatements
between working spouses and
the lack of tax fences for those
taxpayers deriving mcome from
more than one trade.

The transferability of pn-
mary and children's abatements
must be seen as a compromise

between the system of com-
bined taxation and separate

taxation. Before March 1 1991
working marned women were
taxed on their income after
allowing anexemption of only
R1 000 while her husband
enjoyed the full married and
children’s abatements. The new
stem, whereby the married
anu children’s abatements are
divided equally in the case of
spouses earning taxable income
y from each other,
is therefore more in line with
Article 10 of the Constitution
of Namibia.
Mg Johan Pretosnus criticises

rere -queapring aes
OG ee
_ Article 10 of the Constitution
of Namibia.

Mr Johan Pretorius criticises
the present situation whereby
individuals having two or more
trades can, in some cases, off-
set business losses against their
salary income. It seems that
Mr Pretonus is in favour of a
system of socalled ‘‘tax-fenc-
ing’’. The introduction of such
a system will obviously neces-
sitate drastic statutory amend-
ments. Suffice it to say that
such a system will in general
lead to unjustifiable interfer-
ence with private enterprise
and the economic effects of
this could be more harmful
than those of the present sys-
tem. Mr Pretorius’ concems,
however, are noted.

To conclude, as was indi-
cated by the Honourable Min-
ister of Finance, Dr Otto
Hernigel, during his main
Budget speech this year, the
administration of taxation in
Namibia will be decentralised
in the very near future, so that
those Namibians living and
working in the south, will be
_ Drought ‘closer’ to Windhoek,
facilitating the process of
communication.

THE Pian pay-out problem
needs to be solved, and the
Government should by all
means try to do this. We know
there is not enough money for
all the people, but something
can be done. People are con-
. fused when the Minister of

| Information and Broadcasting
emphasises that those who were
not registered in September,
October and November last year
will not get paid.

I personally did not register
at that time, but it was not my
fault. Iwas ina Swapo mission
at that time, and I arrived in
Namibia from Zambia in De-
cember 1990 while the regis-
tranion count had stopped in
November.

When we arrived in Namibia,
we were taken to the Grootfon-
tein army base and we stayed
there for a few days and were
later taken to Windhoek for an
induction. But the programme
failed and we were told to go
back to our families and wait
to be called. Up to now none of
us has been called. We want to
| ask the Minister whether we

are to be blamed for late regis-

tration in these circumstances?

We stayed behind (in Zambia)

because we were ordered to

and not because we chose to.
Please, Minister Hidipo, try
to understand our problems.

set up by the Government for

the ex-Koevoets and SWATF

In other countries, people
make special programmes for

happened in Zimbabwe a few
years ago when they faced a
problem of schools. There were
many children in schools but
not enough to pay the teachers,
and so they increased tax for
those civil servants who were
getting high salanes and em-
ployed teachers to add to their
total number.

Now we have businessmen
and churches and other organ-
isations in our country - why
can't some of them contribute
to the development bngades
so that people can get some-
thing. Also all ex-Plan mem-

itis better to employ 10 police-

We seem to believe more and

that all is well in his Ministry.
I personally feel he should
become more involved with
the problems besetting the
teaching profession, such as
the lack of facilites and ac-
commodation, rather than just
cniticising the teaching corps.

We all know that he was in
exile for 30 years and that the
situation in Namibia is new to
him. We do not blame him for
that, but in order to get his
pnonties nght he should at
least listen with an objective
attitude.

The past colonial occupa-
tion was known for its injus-
tice and discrimination (where
large amounts of money was
spent on education for whites)
and the imbalance is still in
existence. Isreparable damr
has been done and nothing
been done yet to restore ux
balance.

Comparing our meagre sala-

eral or the responsible Minis-
ter could, therefore, advise:

- Why a company which
operates from Cape Town and
which does not even have an
office in Namibia and which
does not employ Namibians,
bat send their own people up
from Cape Town for about two
months every year, have been
given this very hicrative con-
tract?

- Whether Maister Directo-
nes pay tax in Namibia on
what they carn here?

- If not, why not?

- If the contract is awarded
on a tender basis, with privati-
sation will the directly con-
tract be thrown open to tenders
from local businessmen who
can then éstablish an office
here, employ Namibians, pay
taxes and generally benefit our
country as a whole?

I ask these questions as it
seems that Maister Directo-
nes; have had this contract for
many, many years and it has
never been awarded to anyone
else.

With independence, we nast
now stand on our own two feet
and do away with foreign
companies who literally take
the money and run back to
Cape Town. We must estab-

lish local businesses employ-
ing local people. Giving the
directory /yellow pages contract
to a Namibian will be a step in

the right direction.

I look forward to hearing
what the powers that be have
to say.

Still imbalances

1 WOULD like to register my
concern on the matter of Gov-
¢erament houses. The -state of
affairs conceming official ac-
commodation for civil servants
cannot continue as in the past.
Something must be done now.
The Honourable Minister of
Works, Transport and Commu-
nication, you are the only one
who can sec to it at this stage that
our people get what we deserve.
Justice must be practiced with
the allocation of accommoda-
tion for all civil servants. Blacks
are also civil servants and can
also live in these houses now
(which was not the case in the
past). Some believe it is still the
._-gpse because they serve as key

j-most of which are

country.

Comrade Minister, I am con-
vinced that you, as a freedom
fighter, have not forgotten the
imbalances in the rural areas that
are still as they were in the past.
Windhoek inclusive, there are
some houses mainly reserved for
white colleagues (obviously
those in a good condition) and
certain houses fit for blacks
only.

Comrade Minister, we would
like your Ministry to see to it that
the structures according to
which these housing committees
are established, be reviewed, so
that black observers be replaced
and whites be transferred to a
rehabilitation centre.

We need civil servants in our
towns who can re-shape the
status quo.

Officials in Keetmanshoop
even claim that some houses are
reserved for up to three months.
One wonders for whom? Offi-
cials in Rundu, Oshakati, and
Ondangua and other smaller
towns confirm their situation is
similar. I asked some black civil
servants why they didn't apply

for these open houses after they
had worked more than six years
for the government? And their
Tesponse was that they were told
there were no houses available.

If there is no response from
the Ministry concerned, I am
prepared to provide the Prime
Minister’s office with the facts
so that he can come to our res-
cue. We don’t necessarily just

want to replace white adminis-

trators with black ones, but we
would like to see the colonial-
minded whites leave.

Talso hear that whites are now
moving from old-fashioned
houses to newer ones and this
seems to be a strategy planned to
maintain the gap between the
privileged and the deprived.
Renovations are done on certain
houses at the expense of the tax-
payers and on an unfair basis.

I hope people in the Tegions
will be encouraged by this letter
to fight the injustices continuin uing
in the different structures of our
government. Colleagues, guard
against injustice and save the

Student bursaries

TAM very disappointed by the
Ministry of Education and Cul.
ture. 1 am one of those students
in the University of Namibia
who wants to study further both
for myself and the development
and building of the Namibian
nation.

I have applied for bursaries
from the Ministry of Education
and Culture. They sent me a let-
ter of inquiry in which they
asked me to provide them with
Std 10 results, but at that time the
results were not yet released.
They then told me that they don’t
have the course I have chosen
although they had sent applica-
tion forms and booklets to the
school which stipulated the
course in question. Until today |
have had no feedback. I am at
present attending lectures but |
don’t know whether I will get the
bursary or whether I will have to
leave. My parents are very poor
and cannot afford the fees. The
fees, including hostel and meals
plus courses, are about R11 000.

Not many people can afford to
pay this sort of amount.

We students of the Academy
urge the government to consider
this matter. About two-thirds of
the students here don’t have
bursaries and are still waiting for
answers because they have ap-
plied.

We will go on strike unless
something is done.

sad! If only it were an iso-

we all know it 1s not so,
because many of us have
had to contend with cases
of a similar nature ourselves.

In this area, the botsotsos

I am not advocating any

PLEASE allow me space in
your esteemed newspaper to
air my views on what seems to
be a controversial issue - the
purchase of a Presidential jet
estimated to cost R80 million.

I would at the outset like to
state that acquiring a plane for
the country is in no way a
waste of resources consider-
ing the fact that this plane is

going to be used for transport-
ing the President and his en-
tourage to various parts of the
globe to canvass for much-
needed assistance that our young
and fledgling nation will re-
quire from time to time.

On top of that the jet will not
be used for the President's
private purposes but rather for
purposes beneficial to the
development of Namibia and
its people. Obviously when the
President is not travelling the
aircraft will be used commer-
cially, thus bringing in addi-
tional revenue for the state. As
opposed to the chartered plane
which is costing the govern-
ment and the taxpayer, if you
like, thousands, if not millions
per day? Therefore the pur-
chase of an executive jet is a
cost-saving exercise rather than
an unwanted and unwarranted
expenditure as some of our
countrymen tend to believe, |

Painstakingly, those Oppos-
ing the idea are mostly those
responsible for the misery and
poverty of Namibians and
suddenly and ironically are
today ‘championing’ the ‘cause’
of the disenfranchised com-
munity hence the unofficial
spokespersons of these people.
This is sheer hypocrisy. There
are those who maintain that
the acquisition is untimely
because of the drought situ-
ation in our country. Well and
good. That the country is
drought-stricken is a reality too
obvious to be missed even by
the Government. To be realis-
tic the Government is in no
way ignoring this problem and
instead it has announced emer-
gency measures in a bid to
address and thus arrest the situ-
ation!

Concomitantly, to my own
understanding and belief, the
President had to charter a plane
to go to Iran - to name but one
country - where he won a deal
to supply the Iranians with beef
in exchange for oil which (the
beef) otherwise could have
flooded the local market, thus
forcing the drought affected
farmer to sell it below market
pnices.

In anutshell, Iam just trying
10 appeal to my countrymen
and women not to criticise
everything left, nght and centre
just to let themselves be heard,

but should rather be objective
and constructive,

I realise that there are those
who have their own political
agenda (perhaps a hidden one)
and who will try to frustrate
the efforts of the new dispen-
sation in order to win some
political votes, but acquiring a
plane which is obviously going
(0 serve the national interest in
for example taking ‘us’ to the
top of the world in search of
assistance when in dire Straits,
1s something worth justifying,

stating that the country lives
on borrowed time? Allow me
one more question: Did the
Honourable Ministers of Trade
and Industry and Finance voice
their strong objections against
tbe purchase of the Presidea-
tal plane for R80 million?

The question to be asked in

this regard, and which has not
been touched upon by either
the press, the Prime Minister,
State House or the Ministry of
Works, is whether it is cheaper
to buy a Presidential jet for
R80 miilion instead of charter-
ing planes? Why did State House
not come up with facts and
figures to silence the critics?
The reason is simple: they
cannot, because itis cheaperto
charter planes ghan to buy one
for R80 million and spend
hundreds of thousands of Rands
a year to operate and maintain
It.

Honourable Mimsters of
Trade and Industry and Finance,
please consider the following:

tions in order to start a verture.

Against this background,

‘al profits (before tax) of
Ro million for each of these 80
companies are not out of reach.
At a corporate tax rate of 42
+ cent, the taxman would
collect R67,1 million from the
80 ventures annually, and ad-
ditional reverme from personal
income tax. If every one of the
80 companies creates 50 job
opportunities, 4000 people
would find work and income
in order to support an addi-
tional 12 000 to 16 000 people,
such as family members.
Economic and industrial
development is what this cour-
try desperately needs,,Honour-
able Members of the Cabinet,
pot lwanous jets for the po-
litical elite. And nobody should
bide behind the statement, that
the cost for the plane is met by
French development aid. Lf this
is the case, it is, indeed, strange
what some people perceive to
be development aid. Aid of
this nature does not contnbute
towards the development of
the nation, but contnbutes
towards the creation of a new
elite. As such, aid of this na-
ture should be rejected with
the contempt it deserves. By
this way, I am sure that the
French public would not con-
done aid of this nature. After
all, it is their tax money with
which the jet is paid for.

In a bitter and protracted
struggle we successfully fought
against the old elite. However,
thousands of brave Namibian
Patnots certainly did not pay
the highest price to help a new
elite establish itself to live in
perpetual hixury and presump-

ANON

The jet outcry

IT has never been part of my

culture to engage myself in
public debates which are being

over-emphasised for political
gain.

In the face of the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an R80 mil-
lion jet for the Government
and officials of the Republic
of Namibia, I was faced with
several questions which I could
not help to answer.

I fully concur with the fact
that our country faces numer-
ous problems, some short term
and others long term. Take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane.

Now the question is whether
it is true that those ‘Muyon-
gos’ who presuppose that the
R80 million could have been
better spent if used for relief
programmes, are more sensi-
tive to the realities in Na-
mibia? If so, how far back
have they (Muyongos) been
so critical about the way in
which taxpayers’ money has
been spent for the purchase
of things such as Casspirs and
Mirages by their regime, the
former interim government?

Or, does Muyongo want us
to believe that the money mis-
used on the purchase of war
material at the time of their
rule was less than R80 mil-
lion? And was it not taxpay-
ers’ money?

This country has inherited
a debt which it has to repay
due to the misuse of funds
and the criminal war which
was imposed on our people.
Again, does Muyongo want
us to accept that the drought
and other social evils in our
country today are new hap-
penings? I assume not.

Unemployment, hunger, to
mention but a few, are the
legacy of the past history of
the country. Even at the time
of successive colonial regimes,
the problems were there.

As these problems did not
prevent them (the Muyongos)
from purchasing wanton war
materials which ran to bil-
lions of Rands which this
country is left to repay today,
likewise, should these pre-
vent the legitimate govern-
ment from purchasing a plane
which will enable the Presi-
dent and other Government
officials to maintain contacts
with the outside world for the
benefit of the people of this
country?

‘ Bven if the plane were not
purchased, could there be
someone who would come
up with a formula which would
serve .aS a means through

which the R80 million would
have been better spent?

How many foreign compa-
nies have been offered op-
portunities to invest in this
country? And the shocking
result is often that instead of
employing Namibians, they
either bring in their own
employees (foreigners) or they
simply amass huge profits for
themselves and transfer the
monies out of the country after
having paid the locals poorly, -
something which is tanta-
mount to exploitation.

The logic of buying a plane
for the State is explicitly clear
and it must not merely be
opposed for the sake of op-
posing.

Mr Muyongo, sir, being in
the opposition does not nec-
essarily necessitate you to op-
pose every undertaking of the
government. It rather requires
you to show the people of this
country that you have the abil-
ity to be an alternative gov-
ernment in the future - some-
thing which your colleague
Dirk Mudge and his Party,
the DTA, have already been
proved wrong by the major-
ity of the people of this coun-
try.

Confusions

FROM my point of view as
an entrepreneur, I do not agree
with the statement of the new
Namibian National Chamber
of Commerce and Industry
(NNCCI) in connection with
the plane for the President
(The Namibian, May 12). I
got annoyed. How is it pos-
sible that such an organisa-
tion which claims to repre-
sent the private sector, can
make such confusing utter-
ances?

I went to the NNCCTI to dis-
cus this matter and to ascer-
tain whether the newspaper
report was a true reflection of
the original statement. This
was confirmed and I was told
that the comment was also
meant to challenge people and
to elicit a reaction.

During my discussion with
the General Secretary of the
NNCCI I then raised the fol-
lowing points:

They believe that the R80
million invested in the plane
will bring about more bene-
fits than disadvantages. But
the NNCCI cannot support
that statement with a compre-
hensive evaluation of the facts.
That should have been done
to avoid the perception that
the NNCCI is flattering the
government.

Without doing its home-
work, the NNCCI should avoid
to criticise publicly its own
members or organisations eli-
gible for membership.

They accuse the private
sector of not having addressed
its responsibility where in-
come-generating is concerned.
Thus the government needs

destruction

AFTER a silence of nearly
one year we have decided
to inform you again about
the tournsm situaton in
Kaokoland and other related
matters.

The destruction on all
levels is getting more in-
tense every day. One of the
biggest contribuung factors
are the two articles that were
published last year in Get-
away, a magazine for tour-
ism in SA. Extra car tracks,
fire places, rubbish and a
direct interference with the
lives of local people are but
a few senous problems. Is
there any control to deter-
mine the number of cars
entering the area and do the
authorities know whether
these visitors follow the basic

are not enough. Construc-
tive planning on all levels is
required to save this area.
Are you, as a Namibian,
satisfied that this unique
ecosystem gets trampled by
cars? Is it acceptable that
the people of this area get
exploited and disgraced by
people who do not care for
them, but see them most of
the time as primitive and
lazy?

If the government does
not take a positive attitude
towards the future of this
area, very soon you might
find that the socalled ‘last
wildemess’ has changed into
the lost wilderness. There is
no doubt in my mind that no
senior official in the depart-
ment of Wildlife, Conser-
vation and Tourism knows
what is going on in Kaokol-
and. Did any of them visit
the area in the past three

tules? The answer on both | years to get a detailed pic-
questions is a definite NO. | ture or were there any re-

If they knew the answers
they would have reacted a

and without contol is fatal.

gives Mr Joubert the nght
to have ‘his route’ pro-
claimed as an official 4x4
route?

Promises of proclamatidn

Coast does not serve any
purpose.
An even more sensitive
subject is the Skeleton Coast.
Itis well known that this big

area is open to one safari
company only and that all
other operators have no
chance to go in there.

Why does one company
have the privilege to make
money out of an exclusive
area while other operators
who can give the same serv-
Ice are neglected? We more
than once offered to stay
within all rules applicable
to this area and also to pay ;
concession fees. Why can
people from this country not
visit the area just because it
is too expensive. There are
operators in this country who
can give the same service at
half the present fly-in price.
To allow two or three op-
erators in the area can only
mean more money for tour-
ism in this country. Why
the blatant favouritism? The
night to enter the area cer-
tainly cannot belong to one
person only and if that is the
case then the system in this
area 1S cormpt.

As a taxpayer of this
country I am certainly en-
titled to know what conces-
ston fees are paid yearly for
this big area.

Is the present concession
still valid? It was clearly
Stated in early 1991 that the

concession would be temni- |

nated on 31 December 1991
and thereafter it would be
decided what to do with the

area. After six months it is
sull the same operator. What
is happening to honesty and
integrity?

What is the present state
with regard to the western
part of Kaokoland being
declared as a nature reserve
area?

Why do the authorities
openly allow the wide-scale
smuggling of liquor in
Kaokoland (and other ar-
eas)? For a group of tourists
to encounter drunk people
at villages cannot be to the
advantage of tourism inthis J).
country. Is this smuggling
within the law of the coun-
try?
The public have the night
to know what is going on
when it comes to matters of
general importance. This
beautiful country belongs to
all Namibians and we cer-
tainly have a right of en-
tmace into certain areas,
especially when there is more
than just the one option |
available.

Why does everybody at
the moment close theireyes
to the problems of Kaokol-
and? Is it ignorance or what
1s the problem?

Your comments as a reader

are appreciated. It can only
help for better understand-
ing ifa senior official in the
department can give us
objective and concise an-
swers to these problems.

Mixed feelings

I WISH to react to the socal-
led Okahandja Doclaration
which was read to the audi-
ence who gathered at the All
Herero Cultural Memonal Day
in Okahandja recently.
While I wholeheartedly
support the cultural gather-
ing of that nature, I have re-
ceived the declaration with

mixed feelings hecause many
of those who claim to be
Sympathetic to the repatria-
tion do so in order to reap
massive harvests as they have
done in previous times. For
instance, the same messiahs
went to Botswana and col-
lected money and Lister en-
gines on the pretext that such
engines would be installed in
boreholes drilled for them by
the colonial administration in
Namibia and to date we do
not know the whereabouts of
these engines and the moncy
In addition some Batswana
nationals were accused of
having engaged lawyers in
order to block the repamia-
tion and hence each of those
who wanted to be repatnated
were asked to contribute a
specific amount so that they
could engage lawvers to ef-
fect their repatnation. From
the moncy collected, people
ennched themselves by pur-
chasing farms and buying
houses. I be beve vou will agroc
with me when I sav money 1s
collected. but notto the hene-
fit of those supposed to make
a living. An example is the
appeal made to Herero people
here and abroad to make
conations to build a decent
house for their paramount
chief. This received a posi
hive response but to date
Hereros hear that the house
was built by the colonial
administration with taxpay-
ers money which means the
house is a government house.
We have no legal claim to it
although we contnbuted

_ money to build it.

] want to send a strong appeal
to foreign mussions and the

Government of Namibia to
see to 1 that this illegal col-
lection of money and mate-
nal equipment by the socal-
led messiahs is brought to an
end with immediate effect.
Finally I appeal to the same
government and non goverm-
ment organisations to chan-
nel their assistance through a
body worked out by those who
want to be repatriated and that
body or association be regis

' tered and recognised by both

Detainees respond

THE New Era of November
12-18 published a letter froma
certain Shoye Sheya (Oshakatt)
under the heading ‘Detainees
debate irks reader’.
The letter is characterised
‘by outdated rhetoric and not
only aims at disgracing the status
of the former Swapo detainees
but to stir hatred and blood-
shed among Namibians. It is
. | incomprehensible how a news-
, | paper wholly funded by the
y taxpayer can descend that low
and spread such sick Views.
: Mr Sheya and New Era writes,
| | among others, that ‘the former
South African agents must bear
in mind that it was not Swapo
which sent them to spy in the
_ | organisation’. The letter fur-

ther portrays the Swapo de-
tainees as having been respon-
sible for the deaths of many
Namibians through ‘treacher-
ous ways’.

It must have been during
such a time that Jesus Cunst
shook his head and said ‘Lord,
forgive them, for they don't
know what they are doing ..’ It
is a sad case. Yet, we shall

r | forgive the naive ‘revolution-
. | ary’ Shoye Sheya. But the
; | Shoyas and the New Eras should
be taught to understand our
bitterness.

Let us start with the basics.
The former Swapo detainees
are also former freedom fight-
_ | ers. and many are former Plan

combatants. When the heroic

exploits of Plan fighters and

| the herculean efforts of Swapo
diplomats, nurses, teachers,
mechanics ... will be reflected

i | Swapo detainees will be there.

detainee. For a moment they
remember the past, you know
those old days, and lock in a
warm embrace.

Then, usually the former de-
tainee becomes bitter and the
Swapo looks down or starts
crying in despair.

There were and are still many
such episodes. During such
times, the sympathisers of the
ex-detainees ask in wonder how
1s it possible you can embrace
your tormentor. I am sure the
Shoyes in turn ask the com-
rades how he/she dare embrace
a ‘spy’. Those who were not
there will not understand many
things.

Certainly it must be mind-
boggling to Shoye how those
very ‘traitors’ are allowed to
occupy top positions in gov-
ermment and how they are

fighting. They fight and fight
and never listen to reason as
each hopes to deliver the final

Naturally exhaustion sets in
and each realises a knockout is
wishful thinking. At that stage

' | the simplest gesture can stop
the fight and the two will never
again be the same. For one,
they start to respect each other,
then they tolerate each other.

Budget comments

GENBRALLY the
budget is quite positive
and I join the other bun-
Greds of Namibians in
welcoming it. It is par-
ucularly good for the
Government to reduce
direct tax on individu-
als

Although I consider it
positive, and congratu-
late the Minister and his
Staff, I still feel he did
not fulfill all our expec-
tations. The following
Points need to be al-
tended to by Parhament
in their deliberations:

- The Ministerhas wid-
ened the definition of
sole breadwinner to in.
clude divorced parents
with sole custody of their
children and unmarried
mothers who do not re.
cerve legal maintenance
This staterment 1s sexist
and discriminates against
uiunarnied fathers who
hive with theirminorchil-
dren without contnbu-
uion from the matemal
Side. Believe it or not,
Uhis 1s true in some cul-
lures. T am not saying
there are as many un-
Mrarned fathers withsole
custody of their children
as there are such moth-
ers, but the legal defin:-
fon should refrain from
Ssexusm.

- T have been expect-
ing legislation to change
to grant ‘dependent re.
bate’ to those who take
care of children not their
own and other disabled
adults. Some of us look
after children who attend
school but who are not
our biological or adopted
children, but we get no
rebates for them. I am
not saying there should
be a rebate for a foster
child, but at least a de-
pendent's rebate would
alleviate the burden.

The Minister referred
to the Sou ch African tax
laws. If they alfow a re-

- This worrying to note
that the Goverment has

Government is the sole

parastatals pay tax in-

Its actions since inde-

speak of a positive com-
mitment towards the
country and its people. It
certainly does not want

tes, like paying taxes.

Atits annual congress
in August the NAU ac-
cepted the principle that
livestock values should
be adjusted and that ag-
ticulture should be
treated equally to other
sectors. The congress
however felt that the
unique situauon of the
farmer (commercial as
well as communal)
should be taken inlocon-
sideration and that only
realised profits should be
taxed.

Can you expect farm-
crs, who made no profits
due tu the drought situa-
tion, to pay taxes on the
increased livestock val-
ues and still survive?
Also, what about their
dependents, those who
have worked on their
farms for years? If the
concerned farmers hav:
noincome, who will car4
for their farm wockers?
Remember, agriculture
is one of the biggest em-
ployces.

unfair to link this matter
to the past, as Mr Sievers
has stated: “They no
longer deserve privileges
or sympathy, It is now
for them and not the tax-
payers, to bear the con-
sequence of their negli-
the past”.

Let us assure Mr
Sievers that the commer-
cial farmers are commit-
ted to this country and its
people and would not like

to lay claim to anything —

at the expense of any
person or sector. And
they are taxpayers as
well.

Really, fellow
Namibians ..
AS a concerned tax-

payer and Namibian,
what! would like toknow
iS!

Before being moved
what was Mr Mubita
doing in addition to Talk-
ing Point? And what was
he getting paid for it?

Surely, also, it was Mr
Mubita who created the
storm around himself.

At the end of the last
Talking Point he pre-
sented, it was Mr Mubita
himself who announced
the news that he was off
the show, and the same
Mr Mubita who said that
Talking Point was being
taking off the air “by a
small minority”.

From what we heard
later, this was very far
from the truth. Indeed Mr
Mubita was being moved
or sent for training or
whatever, but from the
official statements there
apparently had never
been any plan to take
Talking Point off the air.

SO, we must ask our-
selves then, what was Mr
Mubita trying to do?

On another level,
surely some sort of ac-
tion should have been
taken against him for

_ deliberately passing on

Reporting From Dr Tjingaete

IFOUND your editorial
comment “A call for
more productivity” in
which the report of the
Auditor-General tor the
financial year ending
March 31 1993 to be
most tHluminating

Vhere are a number of
points which [ beheve
deserve further com.
ment.

Firstly, a person who
should be ‘independent
and objective’ should use
such expressions which
reflect his or her obyec-
tivity.

The Auditor-General
has created for himself a
problem of expression
for future reports.

The use of expressions
as ‘culprits’, ‘fraud 1s
rampant’, ‘outstanding S
& TE allowances have
reached alarming pro-
porbons’, ‘chaotic fash-

ion’ as these terms are
all relative to one of de-
gree and substance

For instance, the ¢x-
pression ‘rampant’ 1s
used denoting that a situ-
ation has arisen where
the incidence ot fraud
has reached uncontrol-
lable (mass or mob) pro-
portions and the perpe-
trators thereof are doing
tin an aggressive and
defiant manner.

The Ministry of For-
eign Affairs 1s one of
those singled out where
traud 1s rampant.

Now when one checks
the AG’s own comment

under ‘Auditor opinion’
on page 86 of the report,
reference is only made
to one incident of thelt,
in| which Zambia
Kwacha were stolen and
on page 96 under
subparagraph 3.7.7.2.
‘Fraud'theftumisuse of
government property
and manpower’ the Au-
ditor-General himself
reports: “Nothing in this
regard was reported to
me by the accounting
officer nor were any de-
tected during the verifi-
cation of annual report
informauon.”

Come on Dr Tyingaete,

be farr. does this add up
to rampant fraud’ orare
you guilty of using your
independent office to at-
tack the Minister of For-
eign Affairs because he
dared to criticise you?
This surely seems to
be the case as you ven
disappointingly on page
3 question the right
privilege of cerainmem-
bers of the National As-
sembly to do what they
are appointed to do and
that tS to question the

ments of any person
which they regard appro-
priate lo raise in purlta-

ment

Yoursensitivity to this
Situalon suggests vou
are not able to take erit-
cism (which you must
accept as part of the
democratic process) but
you feel free to criticise
others in a subjective
fashion, whereas your
high office calls for a
clear head and objective
reporting

Finally, | tind the par-
allel of your comments

THE letter ‘Call to resist
Sanlam’s plans’ published
in The Namibian of Sep-
tember 23 contains fac-
tual mistakes and
muspercepuions. Kindly
allow us to clarify the
matter.

|. There is no question
whatsoeve, that the
Gathemann and
Kroonprinz buildings in
Independence Avenue
will be ‘destroyed’. To the
contrary, these two his-
torical buildings will be
retained in full, and not
only the facades. Instruc-
tions to this effect have
been given to the archi-
tects. Because the design
poses a tremendous chal-
lenge to the architects, we
were not in a position to
supply The Namibian
with final architectural
drawings at the time of its
report on the 21st which

would have prevented the
unfortunate assertion
“that the plan seemingly
violates historical monu-
ments legislation”.

2. We agree whole-
heartedly that these two
buildings are “not useless
artifacts but working
buildings”. That is why
they will be retained in
full. Insofar as it is neces-
sary, the buildings will be
renovated, repaired and
maintained to remain
‘working buildings’ and
simultaneously be a valu-
able tourist attraction and
an aesthetical asset to the

city. Sanlam has a proud
track record of its devel-
opments being sensitive
to historical, aesthetical
and ecological factors.

3. Thirdly, we would
like to clarify the asser-
tion that Santam 1s a ‘for-
eign developer’. The de-
velopment is an invest-
ment of Namibian funds
on behalf of the thousands
of policy-owners, pension
fund, medical aid, unit
trust and other financial
service clients of the com-
pany in Namibia. As a
mutual company, Saniam
has no shareholders: all

its assets belong to its cli-
ents. Apart from our obli-
gation to earn optimal re-
turns for our clients, it is
our policy to support these
clients and communities
by means of projects and
investments that would
benefit that particular
community. We evaluate
possible investment
projects on an on-going
basis, and would like to
support our clients in other
centres in Namibia as
well.

4. Also in the wider
context, the city and the
country as a whole stand

to benefit in terms of the
employment created and
by way of taxes paid to
the city and the state. As
far as possible we make
use of local labour, local
matenal and local contrac-
tors. Apart from this im-
portant contribution to the
economy, our primary
duty as property investors
is the creation of commer-
cial accomodation. There
is a lack of A-grade of-
fices in Windhoek, as is
bore out by the fact that
the Sanlam centre in In-
dependence Avenue has
been fully let since it was
officially opened by Dr
Libertine Amathila on
October 12 1990.

ALLOW me to express the feelings of ruling party
Members in your newspaper. We in Swapo are
committed to democratic principles and therefore
Swapo ts calling on registered voters to exercise
their democratic nghts to vote in the coming general
elections.

We are not campaigning fora two-thirds majority
but for the overwhelming majority to rule this
country. Itis nota seeret that we are ruling, and we
have and will continue to rule Namibia according to
the democratic structures put in place by Swapo.

We in Swapo believe and know that democracy
will stay forever in this country.

Other parties have often relied on tribalism and
racism to promote their cause and they therefore can
claim to represent Namibia as a whole. It should
therefore be a wonder that Swapo has provided four
and a half years of peace and tranquility in Namibia.

We live in peace today because of the commit-
ment of Swapo to seck unity in diversity in our
country.

In spite of the fact that some opposition parties
have insulted S wapo leaders personally, itis Swapo’s
leadership and maturity that has never wavered
from the commitment to freedom of speech.

In the past years Swapo has committed itself to

nation-building, knowing that Namibians deservea
government that has priorities as they do. The
Swapo leadership has ensured development and
they also believe there must be contact between
government and people at all levels. That 1s why
Swapo has branches and sections at grassroots
level.

The Foreign Investment Act was passed, which
regulates the framework tor foreign investors. In-
come tax was reduced twice. Job creation was one
of the top priorities.

In the next five years Swapo’s priority will be to
secure existing jobs and create new ones. For exam-
ple the Free Trade Zone will create more Jobs for
Namibians and that is part of Swapo’s priorities for
the next five years.

Tourism will be expanded and housing, water,
electricity, education, health, agriculture and fish-
eries will be promoted.

Therefore in the next five years Swapo will accel-
erate change by creating new opportunities for
Namibians through economic growth, better educa-
tion and health services and more Jobs.

for official’s

‘fondling’?

WOMEN'S Solidanty was shocked
to her that Mr Vero Mbahurua was
recently found guilty of sexual moles-
tation in Canada while representing
Namibia on an official visit. We were
even more hormfied to read tn The
Namibian of November 3 that Mr
Mbahurua was quoted as saying that
in his culture it is not an offence “to
fondle someone”. We would like to
make several points about this inci-
dent.

1. We often hear similar ‘cultural’
arguments applied to issues involving
women. There are ‘cultures’ in Na-
mibta which have endorsed racism in
the past but this is never accepted as an
argument for aquiescence to contin-
ued racism. By the same token, ‘cul-
tural’ beliefs are no argument for con-
tinucd sexism.

Furthermore, we wonder whose
‘culture’ Mr Mbahurua had in mind.
We suspect that ‘his culture’ means
the attitude of the men he knows,
because we know of no Namibian
women who agree to be treated as
sexual objects against their will.

2. Every ‘culture’ in Namibia ts
subject to the Namibian Constitution
and the laws of the land. Our Consti-
tution forbids sex and race discrimi-
nation and guarantees human dignity
to all persons, male and female, black
and white.

Article 19 ofour Constitution, which
covers cultural freedom, clearly states
that people in Namibia have cultural
freedom subject to the condition that
they do not violate the terms of the
Constitution or impinge upon the rights
of others,

Hf the incident. in question had taken
place in Namibia, we would have ad-
vised the woman to lay a criminal
charge of assault or indecent assault,
“Fondling” a woman without her con-
sentis justas much acrime in Namibia

as itis in Canada.

We hope that Government officials
do not think that they are exempt from
our Constituuon and our laws - no
matter what their ‘culture’, they are
Namibians and they have a duty to
obey our laws. Mr Mbahurua, as a
legal advisor, should know better.

3. According to the report in The
Namibian, Mr Mbahurua’s fine was
paid by the Commonwealth Parha-
mentarians’ Association and was re-
funded by the Namibian Government.
Why ts this? Was fondling a hotel
cleaner accepted as part of Mr
Mbahurua’s official duties? Are the
Namibian taxpayers expected to pay
for his disrespect for human dignity?

4. We would like to make a public
appeal to the Namibian Government to
take this incident very seriously. A
Government official travelling abroad
onofficial business represents Namibia
and everything Namibia stands for.
Women’s Solidarity would not like the
world to believe that Namibia is a
country where such behaviour is con-
doned or ignored.

We believe this offence calls for the
strongest public condemnation. We
also question whether a person who
shows such disregard for basic human
rights is worthy to act as a legal advi-
sor.

S. Finally we would like to applaud
the courage of the woman who laid the
charge against Mr Mbahurua in
Canada. It must nothave been easy for
a hotel worker to speak about against
such a prominent official, and we tind
this woman's example to be an inspira:
tion to us all,

We hope that the Government wall
keep the public informed about the
follow-up to this ugly incident.

ALLOW me to air my dissatisfaction
about the unfavourable odour in
Tamariskia and Mondesa townships.

The inhabitants of these towns face
a huge problem which ts the never-
ending small of what seems to be
human eacreta. The smell is worst in
the houses situated in the place known
as ‘Old Tamuariskia’.J want to ask the
Town Council of Swakopmund about
the removal of the controversial sew-
age dam from the middle of the resi-
dential area.

Asamatter of fact the former white
municipal council was blamed for
building the sewage dam among resi-
dences of the blacks. But after the
white council was voted out of power
and the current councillors vowed to
remove it if they were elected, noth-
ing happened.

It seems these were just empty
promises. The explanation that there
is Not enough money to remove the
sewage dam Is not fair as we pay our

rales and taxes as other home owners
and are entitled to breathe fresh air as
others do. Imagine waking inthe night
and tinding your house smells like
someone has just detecated on the
floor and after investigation you find
the whole house smells like that. It
might affect us in other ways too as we
are obliged to constantly use air fresh-
eners to make things bearable.At

Letters Hoe the
EAtite

1 AM reterming to the
“dreamdeal’ clinched by
CDM with our peoples
government. ,
The more one takes
note of the persistent
inner issues of the deal,
the more Iam starting to
seriously question the
loyalty, ability and ca-
pacity of the Namibian
team of negotiators.
Considering the fact
that CDM, with its mo-
nopolistic conduct of
business, needed a part-
ner like the government
that would otherwise
sustain their dead end
track, why give intosuch
a lopsided arrangement?
Was the agreement
due to unfair composi-
tion of the negotiating
team or were favours

offered?

Both of these are valid
questions that need to be
analysed by the nation
as a whole. It 1s aknown
fact that Namibia, and
especially the inner cir-
cle of cadres considered
on the basis of their in-
volvement in the bush
struggle, does not offer
the depth and ability to
negotiate their win.

This no doubt leaves
the leadership with a
very slim base from
which to compile a
strong effective team that

could ensure a win-win
situation at all costs.

This, coupled with fi-
nancial favours, is some-
thing not new to CDM
operations and could
have been decisive fac-
tors in making the
Namibian team lose
sight... Why else should
they agree to aclause on
confidentiality and ex-
clusivity on sales.

How can we expect the
respect of the Namibian
nation by telling them
we are not going to let
them know anything at

all? Was this not why we
were fighting? Are we
doing this type of thing
because we consider the
intellectual and analyti-
cal capacity of our peo-
ple as zero?

We do not nced CDM
- CDM needs us.

The land is ours, our
great grandfathers and
grandmothers, the
Mandumes, Witbovis,
Kutakos and Morengas,
are the ones who sacri-
ficed for this land.

CDM has no right to
determine the terms - we

should call the shots! We
are not to be sold out. No
one has that right.

The President, under
his able guidance. has
brought us to where we
are today.

Hts career cannot be
compromised by junior
officials. We cannottum
around onthe Namibian
people now.

Make public the con-
tents of the agreement!
If the Government has
agreed to lowering the
amount of tax due to the
State, withdraw from
this sham without delay.

Do not underestimate
the intelligence of the
Namibian people.

THE decision to allow Ministers and deputy Min-
isters to Duy satellite dishes from their furniture
allowance (The Namibian, January 24) highlights
inconsistencies in government information policy.

In this case, information ts, quite rightly, being
considered a priority and the state is therefore
subsidising the purchase of satellite dishes, pre-
sumably so that Ministers and their deputics can
keep tin touch with world events. And yet the
government continues to tax books and newspa-
pers, Which are the main source of information for
many people tn this country, particularly those
who cannotafford satellite dishes. To putitcrudely,
the tax many thousands of people have to pay
when buying reading material - books, newspa-

country grappling with widespread literacy - ts

Our priorities

IT seems for me to be the
time that the Government
puts the priorities of our
country night.

On the one side we have
problems with our budget.
We are dependent on help
from abroad. We are wait-
ing in vain for investments.
We are suffering from a most
serious drought ...

On the other side I learned

that the Government is in-
tending to buy a special

aircraft for the President and
nhisters at an amount of
R20 million. If One adds the

costs for maintenance, the

crew, fuels, landing charges
and others, the costs incurred
and to be paid by the tax-
payers will be around R30

million.

For those R30 million we

can buy:
* 1 million bails of lucerne;
or

* 43 000 t or 652 000 bags

of maize or

_ * 22 000 first class air tick-
ets for the State President, .

Ministers and other high
officials for a retour trip to
London, Bombay or New
York; or

* we can build approxi-
mately 5 000 core houses.

R30-million means R21
per capita or R200 for a
family with four children. It

a,

means RISO for each per-
som on work in the modern
sector OF approxumaeh
R550 for each revistered
taxpayer.

On the one side the State
President and his Ministers
used to remind us that we
must save, that we have to
work harder to be more
productive and to be less
luxurious on weekends ..

But on the other hand the
Parliament made acts by
which we enjoy today seven
more public holidays and
seven more yearly holidays
than in the past. Accord-
ingly, our productivity has
decreased by 6 per cent and
the costs of production have
increased by 4 per cent ...

What are our priorities
now?

Rights And

IT ts no wonder criminals are getting away
with murder -they have more rights than their
victims!

Thugs and hoodlums are entitled to:

* Be informed of their rights when they're
arrested

* Be represented by an attorney at the (ax pay-
ers’ expense

* Free food, clothing and medical care while in
custody

* Plea bargain to a lesser charge. Often a
murderer or rapist has the charge reduced to
theft or burglary with the blessing of the judi-
clal system

* A speedy trial. although thes may stretch
their cases oul for months or even years

* Be present at proveedinys and confront their

uxe to ravite interested WINDHOEK

Rights Don’t Balance Out

victims in court

* Appeal to higher courts to lighten their sen-
tence or overturn their conviction.

On the other hand, victims

* Are attacked, robbed or murdered without
warning

* Face financial ruin because of medical costs
or time lost due to injurtes

* Receive counselling only when limited Gov-
ernment funds are available

* Can be exciuded from the (trial

* Aren’t allowed to confront the criminals
unieas they are called-asg witnesses at a trial

* Cannot object to plea bargains

* Endure unbearable frustration while pro-
ceedings are delayed.

PERMIE me space in vour newspaper to address
the Onbudsman, the supposed upholder of our
Constitution in respect of Natural Resources,

Sir,

After returning froma ten day holiday at the
coast, Lam of the opinion that you are not doing
your job, or rather, you are neglecting your
duties.

Let me be specific:

1. Damaging the Environment

When travelling between Okahandja and
Karibib, one cannot help noticing one heap after
the other of concrete boulders. ONE HEAP AF-
TER THE OTHER of unsightly rubble. Nobody
debates the necessity of building a fibreoptic line
to the coast for better communication.

Surely this is no excuse for destroying a besu-
tiful countryside with unsightly rubble.

I have taken time to investivate - near the
railway lines there are enough borrow pits of past

construction that serve no purpose.

With aloader and a truck, these heaps could be
removed and the holes filled - a dual purpose
served.

2 Empty bottles and bags

Travelling along the highways, one sees end-
less heaps of plass bottles, 99 per cent of them
non-returnable tin the desert we found only 4
returnable bottles, which we collected). Why is it
NOY possible to promulpate a law, making all
non-returnable fluid containers legal, or atleast
place a heavy tax on all these glass and plastic
containers.

It seems as if all partics concerned shun their
responsibility - firstly, the firm that is marketing
the product, secondly, the lezislator who is well
aware of the negligent attitude of the population
at large, thirdly, the Ombudsman who ls ulti-
mately responsible for the environment and
fourthly, cach and every member of the populu-
tion.

YVake time to look at the legislation of our so
often shunned neighbours and try to estabish

why their countryside is reasonably clean

THE Ministry of Basic Education and Culture
recently printed a thick document advertising hun-
dreds of vacancies at schools in Namibia for 1998.
Is this not a waste of taxpayers’ money printing
such a big document whilst 90% - 999% of the
vacancies are already earmarked or reserved for
candidates? I do not think one needs to come up
with evidence since this is common knowledge
among all teachers and principals. How long will
we tolerate this? Even Nantu and TUN are aware
of corruption and nepotism at schools when it

comes to the appointment of teachers or their

promotion. Are the aspirant teachers not wasting

their time and energy by applying to fill a vacancy

Already Promised

which is already reserved for a specific person? If
these things are still happening when are we going
to start with the process of integrating teachers in
schools? In my understanding integration not only
means taking a black teacher to a white school but
also taking an Ovambo teacher to a Damara or
Nama school. Integration must take place between
Black and White and Black and Black. Fellow
Namibian teachers, let us fight the social evils of
nepotism, corruption and tribalism in Namibian
Schools with all the means at our disposal in order
to build a better education for our children

iis certainly notimmune trom “political correctness’ thateven

| CHOOSE to comment publicly on recent Cabinet
decisions concerning retirement benefits for senior
political office bearers and the reversal of salary
increments given to civil servants.

Many civil servants are already affected by the
latter as increments received since April 1997 are to
be recovered and salary notches reversed as Delore
date of increment.

The same Cabinet hired “financial experts” with
taxpayers’ Money to draw up the performance ap
praisal document and the WASCOM report prom:
ised a ten percent (10%) salary increase With effect
from | April 1997 and then kept sMent.

In my opinion the reason for such harsh decision
would be the unexpected ay aiability Of yobs for ex.

combatants inthe publig service, the recent demon:
stration by unhappy nursing staff or the unay atlabil-
ity of funds to finance the retrement benefits for
senior political office bearers. |

Cabinet agreed to“ gamble” without concem with
our pension fund which is our only benefit in the
grey-haired years ahead, yet they seem {0 be con:
cemed only about their retirement ycars.

Few elderly citizens in our beloved country sur
vive on pension-payouts by government al this mo-
ment but it does not concer the Cabinet members.

Unless the government comes clean on their dect-
sions I am of the opinion that civil servants In
Namibia are used to the benefit of their bosses and
that goes for every taxpayer in the Republic of
Namibia.

THE proposal by the Windhoek Munici-

Louis Armstrong, John Coltane, Elvis
Presley and John Lennon, etc. is not only
laughable, but ridiculous.

How many Namibians have heard or ap-
preciated the music of these people? This
exercise is a waste of taxpayers’ good
money.

Africa has had great sons and daughters
who inspired the liberation of our conti-
nent and who deserve to be remembered:
Kwame Nkrumah, Kenneth Kaunda,
Julius Nyerere Albert Luthuli, Sekou
Toure, Agostino Neto, Hake Selassie,
Edwardo Mondlane, Patrice Lumumba,
Jomo Kenyata, Tafawa Balewa, Samora
Michel and Chris Hant to name a few.

John Lennon Street, Elvis Presley Drive,
Louis Armstrong Avenue is an insult to

our intelligence.

® 7 SINCE the Meeption of the Avncultural Diploma in Namibia
. some years back, it had been understood that the purpose of the
y* diploma was to prepare students undertaking the Course for
. fulfilling national objectives so that after completion of their
d w | studies, they should G0 out and teach farmers the methods of
Sy maximum food production from the limited resource (land)
. without exploiting it.
2 a} Some years back, students who graduated trom the three Agri-
F . cultural Colleges, namely, Ogongo, Neudamm and Tsumis

were Immediately taken in by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Water and Rural Development (Mawrd) to fulfil their objec-
tives,

The circle is turning around. Today a lot of Agricultural
graduates end up roaming around the streets of cach and every
town in Namibia without knowing where the future is taking
them. Where should we go?

» viz, Neudamm and Ogongo respec-

graduating,

Where will these Sraduates-to-be go if the Mawrd is sul failing
to employ their previous graduates ?

Someone might Say they should go and take loans from

Agribank as we were told by one respondent from the Mawrd

the previous year. Can anyone give me an Cxample of a bank

What Future For Agriculture students?

which can give loans without an assurance thatthe loan Will be
repaid back (security) ? Some of us never worked before, Where
will we get the security for the loans ?

One of the respondents from the Mawrd hast
better to have educated
ministry still taking
without a future?
Why should they continue on Producing similar fruits Without
a market for them?

Ifthe market is saturated w ith the Current Product why don’t
they try and change the Structure of the Product so that they ¢
produce different products ? a

I know that every

year said, * ni fs
people in the streets”. Why is the

more students ta undergo similar training

not make some renovations to the existing Product. Why is the
Ministry not doing the same ?.

I think itis time the Ministry take this into consideration, The
should realise the cost involved in (raining students and should
also see the nced to employ these students after successfy]
completion of their studies so that they can pay back the uaining
costs through taxes they will be paying to the govemment.

This ston. sensational

cnough fustre in the
NBC's newsroom. There-
fore, to make It more
thrilling, the Nigerian ts-
suc had to be brought in,
even though the national-
ity of the culprit had not
been confirmed.

It my personal opinion
that NBC lacks the neces-
sary skilled personne! in
Carrying out its duty in an
effective and professional
manner. The organisation
should be restructured to
accommodate competent
staff be it Namibian or
foreign. This will save the
establishment (NBC) and
more particularly the gov-
emment from embarrass-
ment in the court of law.

MAN appeared on earth approximately 3 million
years ago. The society in which the early man
lived, i.c. the primitive society or stone-age-socl-
ety was characterised by equal distribution of land
to all members of that society; land was never
tegardcd as the private property of a particular
person but was collectively managed by our ances-
tors. As a result of natural evolution the physicat
appearance of the carly man changed and simi-
larly, the classless ‘stone-age’ socicty was re-
placed by the “slave-ownership society.”

The “slave-ownership socicty” consisted of two
class i.¢ the slave-owners and the slaves. Some
members of this society contemplated ways of
enriching themselves, particularly means to im-
prove their harvest production. They concluded
that cheap labour and high output would achieve
that end, i.¢. slavery became a popularised and
profitable economic ideology and, for the first
time in human history, a man lost his land to
another man. The slave-ownership society was
later replaced by “feudalism” as a result of arevolt
of slaves against the slave-owncrs.

The “feudalism-system” or society was charac-
terised by more advanced economic development
A great thinker emerged from that socicty who
produced metal and steel tools which were used to
cultivate land and chop down trees for making
houses etc. He started to barter his products and
consequently assembled a vast fortune.

Because of his wealth he assumed the role of a
Hippocratic philosopher 1.c. by propagating to the
people that he was chosen by God (which explains
his wealth) and that he must be recognised by all
people of the Feudal-socicty as their king. This

parliament which consist of two houses ie. the
‘House of Lords’ and the ‘House of the Com.
mons’. The Feudal-Regime was eventually over.
thrown by the class of the landless who revolteg
against the king. The feudal-system was replaced
by a more advanced capitalist systenVsociety,

The capitalist society only replaced Feudal ex.
ploitation of the landless with its new method of
exploiting this class in its industries. The capitalist
society reached its success during the industrial
revolution, a period in which the capitalists be-
came the owners of all means of production, re-
sulting in a constantly growing demand for raw
materials. With this eracame more advanced means
of transport, powerful guns and technology. Gov-
emors and soldiers were then deployed around the
world to conquer various territories and its people,
inorder to exploit the raw materials and manpower
for their industries. The capitalists succeeded in
conquering termtories around the world and man
lost his land for the third time in history. Namibia
was not an exception in this regard.

I therefore sincerely to appeal to the land owners
in this country to consider their fellow landless
Namibians who are living in the iver beds and in
overcrowded unhygicnic conditions; to give them
a piece of land as this will create a better under-
standing amongst the people of our society, ime.
spective of the colour of their skins.

If | may quote Martin Luther King. “! have a
dream that one day the sons of former slaves and
sons of former slaves owners will be able to sit
down together at the table of brotherhood.”

IT would like to catend an appeal to the land
owners and the absentee landlords of Namibta to

voluntarily hand over part of their land to the
Jandless who are living in the corridors of our
country’s roadside and between the farms of the
landowners

I belicve that the day will come when my appeal
will be pul into practice. Our society remains
divided because ofthe unes en distribution of wealth
in this country between the haves and have nots.
Only when we can redistribute the land equally
will Namuibrans start to recognise cach others as
equal partners.

This in itself will solve the unnecessary present
and future land confrontation, und bury the in-
equality that is causing people to dislike cach

was a tuming point in the history of mankind and
is the reason why we have kings and queens today.

History teaches us that nobody was born a king
or selected by God to act as such. Aside from the
fact that the king enjoyed absolute power he also
had no respect for other people's territory or land
and, once again. man lost his ancestral land to
another person, The common people were re-
quired by law to pay tax by submitung a portion of
their harvest or products from the land which they
cultivated. This land was regarded as the private
property of the king. Consequently, with the ap-
pearance of classes the government was born.

In view of this the human society was divided

intotwoclassese.g. the aristocracy andtheclassof other.
the landless people. The class-struggle continued
with the landless demanding the return of their G HARRY

land. A good example of classes is the British WINDHOEK",Back To The Stone Age,with the landless demanding the return of their G HARRYland. A good example of classes is the British WINDHOEK

Issue With ‘Laz’

J REFER to the column “Ekse Kuume™ by
Nehumbilemo ya Ndakomantin The Namibian of
Fnday, Apmt 3, 1998
Asthiscolummn is probably read by many people |
cannot allow the writer to getaway with his unin-
formed remarks about the issuc such as cutting down
the Civil Semice Why does he feel that the opposi-
ton “are dying aslow, painful and ndiculous death?”
ltas ume people hke this columnist stop making such
unfounded and groundless remarks about the oppo
siuon when they clearly know nothing about whatis
happening in the polities of Namibia
The wnier goes on to tot out the hairy old argu:
ment about the opposition only knowing how to
cntucise but never providing any altematives. Allthis
serves to prove is that the wnter never reads hisown
or any other newspaper. The official opposition, the
DTA of Namibia, has provided plenty of alternatives
to, for example, the shocking overspending by the
government, the enormous size of the Cabinet, how
to solve the lands issue, and many other important
issues, but the writer clearly finds iLeasier just to go
along with the stream than to think for himself and
inform himself of what those altematives are.

This is shown by his infantile argument about why
the Civil Service should not be downsized. Where
does he think the money comes from to pay all those
civil servants? This is not a Socialist welfare state
where no one pays taxes and the state employs
everyone until the state is bankrupt. The taxpayers of
Namibia must provide the money to pay all the civil
servants, and there 1s not cnough moncy in Namibia

to support the civil ser tee
Only tthe government stops spending the tar pay-
cr money on unnecessan luxunes and produces a
Budeet which will stimulate the co anomy and boost
job creation will the people about whem the column:
ist chums to be concemed stop sutfenng. Their
suffering certainly cannot be alleviated by giving
them jobs in the Civil Sermice.
With regard to the Budget, the columnist should
inform himself to the fact that no one has to date said
a good word about it. The enticism levelled against
iwhas not come only from the opposition partes, but
also from every economist in Nanubia, including
those who suppor the mayomty party. These are
people who have made their mark in the private
sector, notthe civil service, and who understand what
it takes to make a country’s economy viable
1 believe that as a colummist in a widely read
newspaper like The Namibian, Mr ya Ndakomant
has a responsibility to his readers not to wnte so
thoughtlessly and utesponsibly about issues he clearly
does not understand or has not thought about prop-
erly. If he cares to visit the office of the DTA of
Namibia, we will be happy to inform him about the
many alternatives we have suggested, but which are
regularly wiped off the table in Parliament by Swapo’s
two-thirds majonty, which he no doubt helped to
elect.

Prisoners, in jails throughout the

who are not guilty of acrime. On top of
that they are given lenient sentences by
the courts.

The judicial system maintains that
pnsoners have their rights - something
which really baffles me. They (prison-
ers) are resting peacefully in jails be-
cause they know that the death sen-
tence has been abolished by the Na-
mibian constitution.

Of course rehabilitation pro-
grammes in jails are good and are
welcomed. However, the prisoners

must pay their dues for the crimes the

There are people in this country who
say that the high crime rate is caused by
unemployment. Can anyone prove that
rape 1s caused by unemployment? The
sooner we dispose of that ill-founded

crime through unemployment. Notonly
do we find excuses for the culprits, we

but if there 1s no peace, this nauon is doomed.
The government and the people of this country must
work hand-in-hand for acommon goal: rebuilding and
development of the land - and put their social, reli-
gious and cultural differences aside. The government
which was elected by the people and which has armies,
bombs and other killing materials should not abuse the
national patriotism to oppress, harrass and persecute

those holding different political opinions.

People musthelp the government and pay their taxes
and, as the recipient of these taxes, the government
must construct roads and allow loans for agricultural
development.

As a woman, I see peace as a birthday cake. It takes
a lot of ingredients: patience and love. Peace is not
created by one person. A refugee woman is the target
of rape, violence, harassment, prejudice and mostly
the offenders go free, unpunished and ready to repeat
their offences. There is no tangible ‘piece’ of peacc.
Peace must be whole and enjoyed by all the people of
the country. Peace is a woman who needs to be taken

THE application for a licence by Quickjet Pty
Ltd serving before the Namibian Transport
Commission (NTC) presents an interesting op-
portunity to test the new leyislation passed at
the end of last year amending the Air Services
Act of 1948,

The new legislation specifically removes any
protection against competition for Air Namibia
and TransNumib.

The applicant viz Quickjet is a company
funded with private money and in no way relies
on government for financial ussistance. It is
backed by Namibian Harvest Investments, a
public company whose aim it is to empower
Namibians. It 1s unlikely that any other appli-
cation involving a similar amount of money
(N$1O million) will come before the NTC apain
In the near future.

While it is known that there is another airline
viz Kalahari Express that is also supposed to
serve the Fros-South Africa routes, this airline
has after some two vears not been able to start
operations and it in any case now resorts under
Air Namibia, a company making heavy losses
and becoming an increusing]s heavy burden on
the taxpayers. If Kalahari Eapress is to be run
by Air Namibia with the same degree of
unpunctuality and unreliability as its own serv-
ices then it is certainly in the public interest that
a privately funded airline be given an opportu-
nity to provide an alternative to the travelling
public.

It will be interesting to see how the NTC views
the Minister of Works Transport and Commu-
nications’ latest piece of Icgislation aimed at
making the transport sector more competitive
and less reliable on public (taxpayers’) money.

Free Water For Poor?

IS IT not time to look at the situation
where people are being denied commu-
nal water? How can we be unconcerned
when we witness this? Is itan acecpt-
able practice?

The unemployed in Namibia are a
common sight. They, like all of us, need
water. Must the unemployed die of thirst
or get water for free from poor homes
where they usually come from - the
owners of which must pay? Should we
not direct the employees who look after
our communal assets (Namwater) to
provide:

|) water to those who have paid (a

basic norm)
2) say five litres a day per person free

at each household point for instance’
Similarly a certain quantity tree to
schools and hospitals?

The community have a say in how our
assets should be run - parastatals admin-
ister Communal property and are not
paid badly for this work. Can you travel
freely on the road or pay poll tax, prac-
tised in some countries? Or walk for tree
on a lighted street? Or breathe the air
without paying some parastatal for 1
NamAir?

These are matters of common concern
and thus for common debate.

DR Nickey Iyambo did a most noble
thing in publicly expressing his personal
thanks to those people and institutions
that stood by him during the passing of
his wife. What distracts from the per-

fact that his word of thanks is headed by

the placing of the block-add was most
likely paid for by the taxpayer.

Walvis Youth Vow
To Tackle Crime

IT 1S Christmas and crime ts incteasing every where
in Namibia. The coast is the target of the robbers and
those attacking other people.

The reason is, there is only one Police vehicle to
assist about 5 000 people of Walvis Bay. The rest
have been damaged and in accidents. The Govern-
ment vehicles which have been in the country for
barely three years have been destroyed. Officials
are destroying whats purchased with our our tax
money, the violence ts increasing and we are with-
out transport

A week ago four men attacked an clderly person
in Walvis Bay) Three days after that a certain
businessman in Kuisebmond was assaulted in his
house The worstof alls that the Police renders bad
Service

The youth will not allow the elderly. bustnesses
and other people to be attacked in the streets tor
nothing. We, the youth, will take the law in ourown
hands and we will hit buck hard

We are directing a friendly request to the Govern-
ment, Police Commuisstoner and the Mayor, Mrs
Samaria, in Walvis Bay: stop the violence in Walvis
Bay, we are not atraid of tighting back, we are just
brought up well.

Every weekend someone 1s assaulted. We think
the Police station commander at Kutsebmond should
do something about that.

The only people who stop crime at Walvis Bay
are “Community against Crime’. Magnificent, guys.
we are proud of you. Mrs Samaria, bring more
vehicles and English-speaking Police to the police
stations so that we can just understand each other.

LATE last year I flew with Ai Namibia trom
Windhoek to Frankturt and returned carly this yout

again from Frankfurt. The flights were fantastic. and trom. 1

despite the hard times Air Namibia sul provided us
witha tull bar, two hot meals trom which to choose,
the latest movies and music and a Vanety of duts-
free items. . .

The cabin crew were friendly and assisted the
passengers throughout the flight, the captain on
board informed us about our flight route and pro-
vided us with other useful information. I was very
impressed with the service in the economy class,
which was so much better than other airlines tlying
the same roule.

However, it concerns me that the business class
section was nearly empty. J saw only three passen-
gers seated there at take-off and sections in the

cal Perspecuve™ ot Friday Februar 4.

Thave been acivil servant for the past
eight years. Sometimes one feels so
down just at the thought that crvil serv-
ants do not get any increase or even a
bonus. We live far beneath the bread
line because of debts and no one thinks
of giving us an extra cheque to clear our
debts. We have to buy everything on
credit to try and survive because there
is Never any cash available.

As civil servants, we have only one
form of income and if we want to do
other business we first have to get per-
mission from the public service, and
then this income is also taxed IT gota
Wascom cheque of about NS9 000 last
year which was taxed to N$4.000. Why
can’t they tax these big cheques of the
leaders? This 1s very unfair toward the
ordinary worker.

You work for a month and at the end
of it, youdon’tevenhaveenough money
to pay your debts. Some days you don’t
even have money for a loaf of bread or
to pay the taxi to come to work. Some-
times people can no longer bear the

of the reasons why some people com-

creases: taxis, bread, milk. The one
thing that does not increase is the civil

When will the Prime Minister, hes

Test Politicians For HIV As Wel]

I READ with shock the Suggestion that couples who
plan to get mamed should be required to undergo HIV-
AIDS tests. I do not know why some political leaders
find it necessary to infringe on the private lives of some
people.

This suggestion comes soon after Government de-
cided to subject potential overseas students sponsored
by Governmenttoan HIV test. 1 agree thatitisexpensive
to transport a corpse from overseas or a physically
incapacitated Motswana when the test could have pre-
vented that.

I support this move because we are going through a
penod of economic hardships and need to save money.
But J am disturbed by the latest idea. If we are to do it,
we should start with politicians by asking them to
undergo an HIV test before they campaign for political
office because some of them are cared for by the state
and taxpayers’ moncy 1s spent to pay for their medical
expenses.

Theretore, if such leaders are not tested pnor to
attaining office, then the country can Incurexpenses that
can be avoided by subjecting them to a test.

KINDLY allow us space in your newspaper to air some
concems about matter that are of vital importance to
most Namibians. .

The Namibia People’s Social Movement with mem-
ber organisations in the building, manufacturing, whole-
sale, retail, motor car, fishing and banking sectors in
Namubia wish to denounce and reject the current in-
crease in the fuel price.

The exorbitant increases in the price of tuel that was
announced on September 14 2000 has caused stnkes
and hardships everywhere.

We wish to register our concerns that these increases
that were announced are not budgeted for in most of the
companies that have just allowed increases for work-
ers. These increases also are not calculated in the
inflation rate which employers are so keen to use to

increases.
It is extrémely difficult to create opportunities to
redress this in balsnog.that is now created by drastically

Wake Up NFA, For The Good Of Soccer

LET me ar my disappointment with regards to the
recent resignauon of Mr Dumitru as a result of what]
can call poor communication between him and the
NFA executive.

Firsuy I was disappointed by the feedback riven by
the president of the Namibia Football Association on
the might of June 26, which to me didn’t make any
sense :

He was arrogant and rude to the reporter. The NFA
president doesn’t have any natonal interest at hean
He thinks he can meas up and disorgantse Namibian
seccer with whatever knowledge of law he ROL to
promote himself but he should know that what he 1s
doing now 1s actually kalling our soccer.

How far do vou think we are going to goif we keep
on finng and hinng new coaches because you don't
want to help them the way they see how should the

navonal team should be ruled. How much moncy and
how many vears will it cost us to have our team
quah fied for Word Cup or even for the Afnean Cup of
Nauons.

Why should he side with a player (Nauseb)? I'm not
saying the punishment Dumsuu gave 1s jusufiable but
the NFA was suppose to show thei professionalism in
Unis Case. not to come on air and say: “I'm saying a
player must come back in to the team”.

Yes. we know hes valuable to the team butit’s high

ume that players started to become responsible, know-
ing that they are using up the taxpayers’ money and
there are also other players with potential who want to
play for the nauonal team.

Secondly, letme ask some quesuons on the national
soccer team. Look, we have many national teams here
in Namibia in different codes of sport. How many
mes has our soccer team left the country to play
fnendly matches with others eather in the SADC,
Africa or overseas? Answer: none Why? Answer: no
Money How are we suppose to get money? Through
sponsorship and tundraising events.

Having looked at all those questions I started to
doubt the competence of the NFA executive Are they
sleeping or what? When are we going to have our
soccer team tounng the world or Africa after 11 years
? You've heard the rugby team was in Argenuna, the
cricket team 1s in Canada, but what is wrong with the
football body?

So please letthe NFA answer these quesuons We, the

I WOULD like to ratse a
question about this com-
pensauion business men-
tioned on the front page of
your newspaper today
(16.8.01 ). If any govern-
ment pays compensauon,
it will come from taxpay-
ers who were bom 100
years after the abolition of
slavery. It must be remem
bered that the majority of
black Africans sold into
slavery were Cap and
sold by their fellow black
Africans, probably from
other more dominanttnibes.

The Romans took other
Europeans and Africans
‘ntoslavery. Soin fact did
Ghengis Khan and his
Mongol Hods. The Popes
of the pastand their hench-
men were responsible for
the many deaths. Hitler
killed Jews on a grand
scale. The people from
whom compensation
could rightfully be
claimed are dead. Those
from whom compensation
will now be paid had ab-
colutely nothing todo with
it. I feel that sad as it is
that these human rights
abuses happened, they are
in the past and deserve to

be left there.

COULD you please wam all registered
Value Added Tax vendors to beware of the
latest absurdity that the Receiver of Rev-
enue has come up with.

If your VAT payment 1s late or your
cheques bounces, then they enforce sec-
tion 68 (1) of the Value Added Tax Act
which states. “A person who fatls to pay
any tax payable under this act on or before
the due date for payment shall be lrable for
the payment of a penalty which 1s the
greater of an amount of N$100.00 for each
day dunng which the tax payment remains
outstanding” etc. This happened to achent
of mine who had to pay an amount of N$
1100.00 but forgot to sign the cheque that
he used for the payment. The cheque was
therefore refused by the bank and the Re-
ceiverclaimed inexcess of N$13000.00in
penalties as well as N$ 1800.00 in interest.
Well, this is where they are wrong.

If the officials from the Revenue offices
would take the time and effort and carry on
reading section 68 of the same Act, they

will notice under the same section, namely
subsecuon 2, i states quite clearly and |
quote: “The penalty imposed under sub-
section | shall not exceed the amount of
unpaidtax”, unquote. This means that when
a person owes NST 100.00, the maximum
penalty may only amount to N$1100.00.
Therefore, if a taxpayer fails to hand ina
Nil return, then no penaluies may be 1m-
posed.

I would be gratetul to your newspaper tt
these facts could be taken up with our
Receiver of Revenue and our readers ac-
cordingly informed. | wonder how many
taxpayers have already paid amounts in
excess of whatthey had to. The responsible
officer at the Receiver is a Mr. Kenny
Clocte. | attach copies of the relevant,

How long have we been subject to unjustified
Monopolies in this country - being Telecom and

be awarded this year or early next year

Itis a requirement of the World Trade Organiza
tion (WTO) that all telecommunications markets he
open for compettion by the year 2004, which ts just
around the comer. Our Governmentin the [elecom-
munications Policy and Regulator Frames ork pub
lished in September 1999 recognised the tact that
competition will come for sure

Now at the workshop of May 29, nearby three
years after the Government policy 4s published,
the Legal Adviser of Telecom Namibia Ltd
pleaded for another exclusivity period for voice
telephony.

My very strong plea goes to the Hon Minister
Theo Ben Gurirab and the regulator. being the
Namibian Communications Commission, ty gn
ahead and open the telecommunications market tor
competition. Refuse to let the mighty Velecom Na-
mibia Ltd. once again bring toa halt the telecommu-
nications restructunng process that was started in
1992.

Telecom Namibia Ltd has had a period of ten
years exclusivity in which they had enough tune to
prepare themselves for operating ina free tai and

open market

On the other hand MIC has had a exclusivity
penod for seven years and has hasically coxered the
main towns of Namibia with aecess to mobile te-
lephony

I am not surprised at the
stand of the Minister on
problems experienced by
Unam, and the financial
predicament itis in, when
the following are happen-
ing at Unam.

* There is no equal treat-

same qualifications.

article in your Wednesday
(November 6) edition in

Cabinet decision to expro-

Having closely followed

payers’ funds fora farm such
as Kalkpan. In my view
Cabinet should consider an
amendmentto the Constitu-
tion to allow for the expro-
priation of farms such as the
said property without com-
pensation to the owners.

Kalkpan who successfully
ran the tarm for decades

feel farm owners such as
the current owner of
Kalkpan should not gain
from proceeds arising from
the sale of such farms bought
with funds sourced from tax-

Furthermore denying
such commercial farmers
compensation will serve as
a lesson to commercial
farmers who do not want to

ALLOW me to congratulate Minister Nangolo
| Mfbumba for producing a well-balanced and equila-

ble budget for the 2003-2004 financial year. Through
tis budger Goverment tried to put its moncy
_ where its mouth is.

The budget is so unassailable that even cnitics are
| finding it very hard w dishoutany cniticism. Through
the raising of the tax threshold, the doing away with

the pension bachJog. the salary increase for public
sen ants. to mention but a few positives, the budget
gives an indication that Government is seriously
addressing the problems of poverty and the chronic
unequal drstnbutron of income that charactenses
this country. This is highly commendable.

Bs producing thus rood budget, Minister Mbumba
has now thrown the ball into the coun of the imple-
ments (the Permanent Secretaries of the various
ministries and the CEOs of parastatals) to see if for
a change they will assist Government to achieve its
deficit and debt targets through efficient spending.

On Acquired Expatriate
Dependency Syndrome

THE letter of M Makumbi
that appeared in your es-
teemed newspaper of March
18th, 2003 should not go
without comment.
lam an expatriate who
has been in this country for
the past three years, and
sometimes | get very frus-
trated at the country’s fail-
ure to invest in human capi-
talin fields that matter most.
This has been the cause of
the so-called Acquired Ex-
Patriate Dependency Syn-
drome(AEDS), described by
Makumbi. There seems to
be a total ignorance even of
what kind Of scientists, tech-
nologists and engineers this
country needs. As a result,
more money is being in-
vested in the training of spe-
Ctalists who end UP roaming
the streets looking for jobs,
instead of focusing on train-
ing job creators.

One fact though, is that
Namibians themselves are
not committed to Serving in
Ow paying Professions,
which albeit, require many

years of training and hard
work. The University of Na-
mibia,can for example, hardly
retain a Namibian witha post-
graduate qualification in eco-
nomics, engineering or IT.
They leave the University for
better paying jobs outside the
University, in the Govern-
mentand private sector. Simi-
larly, most Namibian medical
Practitioners find that Private
Practice is better paying than
working in a Government hos-
pital.

That is why Namibia must
be very thankful for countries
like Cuba which continue (o
send their doctors to work
here, and for those other ex-
Patriates, who leave their
countries to work here. As a
Matter of fact, Namibia is not
the most attractive place for
expatriates to work. Salarics
are generally low, taxation is
very high, and even despite
paying all taxes, expatriates
have no easy access to state
benefits such as basic educa-
tion and medical care. Nota-
bly, many of them are leaving

Namibls for their home coun-
tries or to greener pastures
elsewhere.

My suggestion is that Na-
mibia should invest heavily in
higher education in relevant
fields such as medicine and
engineering.

The present level of Science
and Technology programmes
at the University and the Poly-
technic should be elevated and
cach institution should focus
on its state-given mandate,
and develop human capital in
areas relevant to the coun-
try's development strategy at
their mandated levels. ;

After thirteen years of inde-
pendence, Namibia does not
have a medical faculty nor an
engincering faculty at its uni-
versity.

For three years | have been
at Unam, I have seen zero
investment from Government
in the engineering training.
Even the Polytechnic, with its
recently established engincer-
ing school, lacks essential in-
frastructure and human re-
sources to produce competent

technicians, let alone tech.
nologists. Now they want to
become a university! There
is unnecessary and unwar.
ranted competition between
Unam and Polytechnic
which must be stopped at an
costs.

I wish the Namibian peo.
ple success in this more dif.
ficult phase of socio-eep_
nomic liberation. The pre.
scription for AEDS is invest.
ment in science and technol.

,and empowering higher
inctitutions to hire the besy
brains from anywhere in the
world, so that more
Namtbians can be traineg
locally.

That is what even hi
developed countries like the
USA are doing. Replacing
expatriates with ill-trained,
inexperienced Namibiang
for the sake of patriotism, ig
killing this nation directly,
By failing to prepare, you
will prepare to fail.

IT’S a shock to read that a workshop is being
organised to help parliamentarians to under-
stand the tax return forms.

First of all it appears that this is being done
with Government monies. Secondly parlia-
mentarians get paid loads of money and can
certainly afford the services of tax consultants
in their own private capacity. They will argue
that the more business and private ventures
one has the more complicated the form gets,
but they should have thought about this before
entering into these ventures and this is there-
fore no a valid excuse.

The service that they require is by no means
a public good and is therefore not in the pub-

lic’s interest for Government to fund such a
workshop. If the parliamentarians have prob-
lems understanding the forms and paying tax
consultants to do their returns, how on earth
does the Government expect the ordinary per-
son on the street to fill in the tax return forms?
It would be in public interest to hold nation-
wide workshops for everybody including the
wealthy but stingy parliamentarians on how to
fill in tax return forms. And to bring up this
issue five days before the deadline is preposter-
ous and makes one question our leadership!

MUCH noise has been made about the fourth
term. Everyone with ears who dares to care has
heard the President saying the constitution does
not allow him to stand again. He has said he
would retire at the end of his current term. So that
is not the debate we should be having, instead we
should focus on who will take the mantle further.
For a stast, the Prime Minister should have
moved one step up. But given the fact he has
reduced the weight of the office of the Prime
Minister to only opening anything that needs to |

before, and the fact that his wife's business |

greatest challenge for those
who sull have the power to

our enemy and to resist them

Up unl now, these battles
in the community have been
fought by the elderly, on their
own, with others looking on
as if they are not affected by
water andelectncity cut-offs
Butitis no longer possible to
temain silent on these issues,
for itis the very stuff of life
and history To do nothing
and he down ata tme like
this, would be a betrayal of
our most vital interests

The enemies of the poor
are charging inflated prices
for water and when people
are unable to pay, given the
economic condinon of the
masses. then Council cuts off
our water supply Such cru-
elty and naked barbarism
goes unveiled in Windhoek’s
upper chambers. They are
attempting to tum water into
acommoadity for profitand in
so doing, they are depriving
us of our most natural rehts,
invluding the ght to exsst
They are throwing women
andchildren from their homes
and threatening the weak und
vulnerable with moiletary
might Anything except mas-

Water cutotts are uneon-

sttutional and hostile to our
human rights. Using water as
a source of profit ts but an-
other way to force the poor to
pay for the excesses of the

cruel and profit-onented policy
of the privatisers, the bureau-

politicians and their agents
The war against the poor 1s
reaching a new peak and in
this war the poor and uop-
pressed people from town and
country, who have suffered
unspeakable horrors as a re-
sult of the privatisation of
water andelectricity services,
are the greatest threat to the
Council. The Municipality.

privatisers. began a serious
attack on the poor, by forcing
people - even pensioners - to

itself into an enemy of the

that. for that is what itis. and

Now itis time for the champi-
ons of the poor to rise up, to
organise

There will be no greater
Justification for the downfall
and overthrow of the Council
and its backers, no greater
stimulus to socsal revolution,
than the current policy of
Council This policy, in es-
sence, 1s to deprive the poor
people of water and sanita-
tion, of land and of the jobs to
sustain ourselves. The policy
of evictions, of water and
electricity cut-offs is above
all hostile to the needs of our
innocent children, who are
always the most vulnerable
to these attacks from the
Council. Water cut-offs are
unconstitutional and a viola-
tion of basic nghts and must
be declared to be so

Since Council has made a
policy of depriving and si-
lently killing the poor by de-
priving us of our basic nghts,
so (oO It justifies its own

Speeches, Please!

NAMIBIAN voters havea right to be informed inorder
to cast their votes with commitment and maturity as
far as their future is concerned. [tis in that context that
we - again - request “leaders” to stick to the rules of
democracy and free and fair elections.

Mr. Tyirtange, your previous position as Minister of
Justice should have instilled a respect for the Namibian
Constitution in you. That should at least reach as far as
knowing that it is NOT SWAPO that created the
Namibian Defence Force, Police, Civil Service etc. etc.
- that is an obligation every Government of a country
has.

Swapo is just another political party and not the
Government. Sic - we do not live in 1960 anymore - the
year 2044 1s here and we have and want to move on.

We all have an understanding that you might still
fee! bitter about your past - let us, however, look ahead
and rather work for a future that does not bring back
those years. Namibia has so many problems that need
tangible solutions. Solutions will not be found by clinging
on to the past and asking weird questions hke: “What
did Ben Ulenga tell the Boers to be released?”

Absurd statements like “the CoD has been created
by colontalists”.

By the way, Sir, the CoD is a legitimate political
party and not an organisation. You can condemn the
“colonisers” till eternity - as fong as you, the Swapo
party, still depend on them for food assistance for
Namibians your statements boomerang.

Tell the voters why is it necessary to apply for N$37.7
million donor assistance to feed Namibians?

Teli the voters why only foreigners get major building
contracts these days?

Tell the voters why they - after 14 years of
mdependence - stul live in shacks and shambles?

Why is almost every municipality bankrupt in
Nambia? .

Why is each and every parastatal costing the
Namibian taxpayers milhons and millions?

Sir -yvouas former Minister of Justice - should cry out
loud: babies and toddlers are raped on a daily basis.
Criminals rule the country - Namibtans get murdered
for a few dollars - corruption never gets punished.

The hist, Lam afraid, is endless! The Police force ts ill
equipped. ill-trained - why would Windhock otherwise
ask for a Municipal Police Force?

The Namibian Defence Force - whois insane enough
to want to attack Namibia - Nambia does not need that
Force. The money could be spent on housing/educations
health services etc. etc. All these and many more
pressing issues and what can be done about it.

That makes up election material for many months —
Sir-notyour defamations and agitating hate speeches.

Howeser-af your attacks on the CoD are an indicator
to vo by - the Cob is doing a good job and giving you
ample reason to see an opposition in that party,

Mr Tjitianye, please come up with solutions for
Namibians since we all Know that the tax pavers — and
thatincludes opposition party members - pay for Swapo
rallies

We have peace in Namibia - thatis also a credit Co
opposition partes since we can argue in parliament
and don't hase to take up weapons - lets keep it that
way. please. and let's tackle Namibia's multuple

Exorbitant Salaries

} HAVE always been
critical of the develop-
ments at Air Namibia.
Tcould nes er understand
why it was necessary
to hire foreigners as
General Managers who
did nothing but run this
company intothe ground
by purchasing the wrong
planes, failing to organ-
ise anefficient service or
ensuring that the aircraft
was on ume.

One of the managers
received an exorbitant
salary of NS 150000 per
month and eventualls
sulla golden handshake
of a few millon when
he left.

All he did for us was
purchase planes that
cannotmake a profitand
thereby create a perma-
nent financial embar-
rassmenttothe companys
and the Namibian State.
I always stated that a
Namibian management
team should be able
to do much better, and
now that a Namibian
management team has
been instated, the result
is that forergn users
of our airline are most
impressed with the ex-

tremely courteous and
friendly service they are
getting on the plane.

They are also im-
pressed by the fact that
the seats leave enough
leg room for the long
distance flights to make
the flight a pleasure and
they are impressed that
the planes are usually
on ume.

It seems that the
present management has
really been successful in
achies ing a turn-around
in the tmage of our
airline and that is why |
write this letter.

To show them that
their efforts are noticed
by the customers and
are appreciated by us as
citizens.

We can now again be
proud of our national
airline.

What one would only
wish, was thata similarly
competent management
team 1s instated at other
parastatals such as Nam-
Post, where we often
pay a ten times higher
postage for our letters,
which then either never
arrive, or even, when
sent by airmail, arrive

10 or 14 days late.

Students often do not
receive theirnoufication
of exam dates on time
and thus miss them.

Shareholders do not
receive the noufications
of shareholder meetings
and income tax forms
are sometimes delayed
causing penalties and
irritation.

NamPost also thinks
they must hold back
letters that were alleg-
edly stamped too low in
foreign countries from
Which they originate,
having the effect that
those letters eventually
arrive on vour desk two
or three months later.

We need managers
in Our parastatals that
can actually manage
and know what they are
doing.

Thousands and thou-
sands of people are
prejudiced if our par-
astatals do not function
properly and merely cost
us money.

very interested in politics as my wish is to
become a politician.

I know that when I go to Edumeds to buy
my text books there is always VAT on the
price which means I am also paying tax to
the government in order to enable the gov-
ernment to help develop this country or to
help citizens like the people of Caprivi that
are in emergency Situation.

But I am shocked to hear that the Prime
Minister uses Our tax money to go and
campaign for his party at the expense of all
other Namibians. He went to see the Caprivi
victims but at the same time told them to vote
for Swapo. These poor people came to hear
what the government is going to do about
their situation but he took advantage of this
opportunity to campaign for his party.

I] have read this in The Namibian of April 27,
2004 in the statement of NSHR

but I am not sure if this is correct, can Prime

allegations because to me this is a corrupt
practice.

Can he please publicly confirm or deny.

Oshakatl, Ondangwa or
in the surrounding towns

residents also do con-
tribute to the unhy gienic

some people may seek
to score cheap political
points by comparing an
apple to a lemon. One
wonders what Ongwediva
would become without
Oshakat.

In fact Ongwediva is
more like one of Os-
hakati’s suburbs and one
would think that these
ivo towns have a unified
cleaning system, Instead
of competing they must
forge mutual co-opera-

retirement age of civil
servants from 55 years
to 50 vears.

For example | am 53
years Old and forced by
law to hang on until Pm
SS, while | have already
served 35 years and am
spiritually and physi-
cally burnt out. The
doctors said [must hang
on because they cannot
write me otf. Please

dear Prime Minister go
into this matter and give
us a democratic choice,
those who are strong
and productive can go
on even unttl 60.

Those who have start-
ed working al a young
age can be givenachoice
to retire earlier, at least
at 50 years. | also think
that the release of older
people earlier can give
a chance to young edu-
cated people to enter the
civil service.

Only about 10% older
people over 50-60 years
are productive, the other
50% are going to Work
because they are forced
by law to reacha re-
quired age.

Finally dear Prime

Minister, there are agents
going around telling old
people to retire and to
transfer their pension
monies to private insur-
ance companies.

The problem here isthe
very high tax if one with-
draws money from the
fund. About 35% its
deducted. Please let this
practise be stopped. The
GIPF must deal directly
with the pensioner who
wants lo retire. A tay
deduction of 20% can
be considered because
we want to get a decent
pension to go into farm-
ing orlo Start a new
business. | hope this
voice of an ordinary
civil servantcan also be
heard. The government

of today only listens to
the voices of the highly
educated people, there-
fore many documented
ideas and programmes
cannot be implemented
because the people on
the ground are ignored.

Our government must
seriously look into the
current laws regulating
the government pension
fund.

For example a la-
bourer working for 40
\ears is getting NS30
000 (lump sum) and
monthly NS 500.00.
Whatis this? The Prime
Minister, Public Service
Commission, Napwu,
Nantu, Parliamentarians
must look into this mat-
ter. The politicians were

vers clever because thes
de-link and establish
theirown penstonfunds.
Avery zood idea. Please
also think about us.

In conclusion, | urge
my dear Prime Minister
to do at least one good
thing for the public
servants because we do
not know what will hap-
pen after March 2005.
We pray for the new
President Pohamba to
keep the current Prime
Minister for the neat 5
years in the past so that
the public service can
be cleaned. I salute you
Prime Minister Theo-
Ben Gurirab.

IN Namibia too much
lime and energy Is ex-
pended on unproductive
activitics and too much
resources wasted for
us to make meanineful
progress in achieving
development goals and
to be aserious contender
for achieving higher
rankings In internation-
al wellness ratings.

A large part. if not
the majority of devel-
opmental activities in
Namibia, are brought

about by international
funding and develop-
ment organisations,
while we often keep
ourselves busy with
petty and destructive
issues,

We afford ourselves
the luxury of misman-
aging public funds and
organisations, com-
pounding of bureau-
cratic procedures, poor
service to the public
al many government
offices, hate speech,

undermining of Na-
mibians that do make
positive contributions,
keeping of deserved
candidates from the
Olympic squad, etc.
The list ts much long-
er, but I suffice with
these examples.
Fortunately there are
also many people from
all racial groupings
in Namibia who work
hard at building a just
society, bringing about
economic growth, pay-

ing their taxes, conserv-
ing the environmentand
generally carrying the
weight of keeping the
socio-economic sys-
tems going.

These people are of-
ten not seen and heard,
but they are there and
they are the real heroes
of society.

This letter is a tribute
to them.

me the aruecle of 12 August 2004,
“Gawverament should not be blamed
For abuse by civif servants”

Phat statement is an insult to the
Namibian nauon,

If we don’t blame our government
then who should be blamed? ft seems
like the government only wants to be
our povernment when they are eat-
Ing Our Money through tax, when i
comes to taking responsibility they
are in denial, they forget that they
are in their chatrs because of us, the
taNPaNve;s.

When will government recognise
the work of NSHR who are educating
Namibians about their rights: thes
have even published many different
books in different languages. If there
was no such education then the abuse
of baste human rights would be worse
than currently.

Those who don’t recognise that

me space mM your

NSH IR are ta tact is doing someing
iehomintous and are denving whatis
contained tn the report, We ciazens
Know whatis happening ta thts country
and weoare not blind. Phe time will
come When the vovernment cannot
dens the truth anymore.

Phe deterioration of human rights in
this country ts causing and increasing
unemployment, poverty, huunger and
disease. The NSHR ts just behind the
truth, fet the NSHR team do their

job without fear and threats from

anyone.

We cannot tolerate the fact that our
economy is feeding our leaders and
we the nation who are in majority and
who put them in power are living in
poverty, Without the NSHR team we
would not have Known these things.
I therefore, congratulate you people
from NSHR.

WE know that Namibia is officially classified as a less
developed country (LDC) and needs money — plenty
of itin order to cater for its development needs. We
also know that multinationals, such as De Beers, BP,
Shell, cte. have plenty of money, which they are will-
ing to invest,

A recent UN report on human development, which
compares the level of human des clopment among na-
tions, revealed that Namibta has slid down a couple of
places on the world ranking The Nanubian gini coet-
ficient, which mdicates the gap between the poor and
the rich. has also skyrocketed to become the widest in
the world. Although these statsties can be interpreted
differently to suit Vanous perspectives, the one fact
that remains undisputed from whichever perspective
ong looks atit is that the average Namubian’s living
standard has notimproved atall. The question then is
why not? Why could Namibra not make a meanineful
improvement on the wealth of vs natronals? T want to
look at this question from the perspective of muluna-
uonal presence inthe country, because, [strongly belief
they are supposed to be the catalystof development in
any country. Their presence is supposed to boost job
creation, business confidence, financial development.
productivity and further investments.

‘tas clear from the above-stated statusues that the
presence of muttinationals have not boosted Namibia's
wealth creation (poverty eradication) objective.

One of the reasons for this ts that histoncally mult.
nationals are Known for bringing lots of money in, but
sending lots more out - much of it through the back
door’. Itis thts backdoor exit of money from the least
developed countries ke Namibia that destroys their
hopes of ever cradicating pov erty. The backdoor chan-
neling of money 1s done through various means, among

others, embezzlement, diversion of funds, undervalu-
ation of local inputs, false invoicing, non-payment of
taxes, kickbacks and bribery.

for example: We are currently paying extremely
high prices for petrol. Under the current arrangement
all our petrol is coming via South Africa through the
big five - Shell, BP. Engen, Caltex and Total. The base
and landing price calculation is formulated on South
African In Bond Landed Cost IBLC) structure, which
has little, if at all, direct relation to intemational on]
trading prices.

Thts inevitably leads to Nanubians subsidizing the
excessive South African refining margins. This also
enables the oll companies to effectively keep the profits
thatthey make on supplying the fuel to Namibia outside
the country. This diversion of funds 1s one way of back-
door channeling of money, which depriy es the country
of much needed revenue and forces the government
to pass the cost on to the consumer by way of higher
prices al the pumps.

tAxamples of this nature are plenty tn almost all the
sectors of the economy. But whilst we are sll at the
petroleum sector, one should maybe quickly raise an-
otherconcern. Isitteasible fora country like Nambia to
procure anational strategie resource ike petroleum from
a single source (South Africa)? Although not relevant
to the above argument, one needs to critically analy 2e
this concem and maybe create a different platform to
address it. For now, let us scruunsze the operations
of these so-called multinationals and ensure that they
keep human development in Namibia on top of their
agendas

RCC Expansion?

IT’s not April 1. so 1 suppose the story is genuine -
the Roads *Con’-tractor company is diversifying into
property development, and at the auction of municipal
stands held a few days ago. a RCC representative. bid-
ding apparendy on an unlimited budget with taxpayers’
money, bought up a large number of these stands, and
in so doing, inflated prices wildly for the other private
bidders. In fact, he spent NS 8.7 million. Nice to know
the RCC has such an amount available, considering the
recent alleged large-scale misappropriation of funds at
the parastatal, and the massive overpayments for mod-
est jobs done.

[ was wondering if the RCC has ever considered “di-
versifying into road construction, bearing in mind the
current state of our roads, e.g. the seemingly abandoned
Okahandja-Karibib widening. and the gravel roads
around the capital Cevery round trip to the Gamsbereg

Just an idea, before we read later how many millions
the RCC has lost in dodgy property deals.

VD like to commend Mr. Jauch
for the thoughtful, compelling
and accurate reflection on the
deportation of the Bangladeshi
workers, published last Friday,
and] congratulate vou for publish-
ingit. Unfortunately, elsewhere in
the paper. there was an ignorant
attempt at a humorous column
on the same situation.

lt is much to be regretted that
Namubtans, if they think about
the matter at all, simply assume
the Bangladeshis to be foreign
trouble-makers who should tm-
mediately be pot rid of. So little
has been learned from history,
as Mr. Jauch says. We have also
the totally bizarre situation where
irregular work visa, employment
contracts and worker ‘accom-
modation” was seemingly all
organised within one Namibian
family - surely this should be
Invesiigated.

And we have thisequally bizarre
company Ramatex, which seems
to he a state within a State.

Actually I would like to sug-
gest a solution to all this. Let us

just go into the Ramatex facility,

deport the management, and ¢s-
propriate itit. Nothing wrong with
this, despite what the IMF might
say. since in terms of subsidies.
erants, incentives and tax breaks
we have bought the place several
times over.

Run the operation with Na-
mibian manapement, and contin-
ue to supply Ramatex’s overseas
customers as before.

We presumably could sell the
stuff more cheaply since we would
eliminate the huge cut taken by the
present Malaysian involvement.
The staff would then be protected
by Namibian lahour law and be
treated decently, and even the
waste products would be treated
decently. Why not try?
