| WEEP FOR MY COUNTRY,
which has been conquered by
force, and in which oppression and
immorality reigns supreme. The
country in which people have lost
their human dignity, the country
where we are nov treated like
foreigners ...

if anyone enjoys a bit of luck or
finds himself a little better off, im-
mediately his heart grows hard. In
our time people who think only of
themselves are wicked.

No one knows my despair, save
He who knows ail, but my heart is
in a perpetual state of anguish.

Our oppressors should know
that Namibians are not brain-
washed and we will never be blind-
folded. Justbecause we smile and
smile, and happiness is our coat,
they think we are gateposts, numb
to the stab of pain.

Just because of the laughter on-

our lips and our eyes lowered in
respect, you think we are like

stones.

This is our fatherland which has
been pillaged by foreign con-
querors who have exploited and
grown rich on the spoils of our
nation.

Itis time to abolish apartheid. Let
our brothers in South Africa enjoy
peace, equality, freedom and
justice.

Let the world know our problems,
and let us share our problems with
them. Let us demand the im-
plementation of Resolution 435, so

press my views with regard tothe

Namibia has become a politi-

and would like to encourage the
progressives in this country to
maintain and tighten the existing
cooperation among us, which
will lead to political unity.

We have a common identity
and common problems which we
Can only solve when we are polit-
leafly united.

Let us stop demanding minor
reforms like open hotels and
bers, and instead strive for total

and national Indepen-
dence of the Namibian people.

Let us also distance ourselves
trom our various political ideol-

ogles. Wecan pursue these after
Independence.

The South African Govern-
ment has embarked on a strate-
gy Of political intolerance and the
suppression of any opposition
from progressives. In order to
counter this, we have to combine
forces so that they give the
government to the peopte.

Let us unite in order to force
South Africa to relinquish her
colonial positionin Namibia. Our
compatriots in South Africa have
setusan example, andthe ques-
tion for us is ‘where is our UDF,
and who are the Boesaks and Tu-
tus of Namibia?’.

The time has come for us to
complete the circte in our strug-
gle against imperialism, tribal-
ism and colonialism.

We must not wait for anyone to
come to our ald. We must not be
demoralised by the MPC who
clalm to bring about peace and
national reconciliation. We have

seen how members of Koevoet
beat up our people in Katutura
and how Mr Dawid Bezuldenhout
called for the continued deten-
tlon of Josef Katofa. All these
deeds confirm the intention of
the MPC which is to silence
everyone who disagrees with
them.

My assessment is that the MPC
is the ‘strong arm’ of South Afri-
ca, used to further its colonialin-
terests in Namibia. The members
of the MPC do not represent the
Namibians but only their coloni-
al masijars.

People of Namibia, let us stand
up and show them we do not
need a further hijacking of our
freedom.

We have many peacetul ways
at our disposal by means of
which we can fight against the
system. Let us rally oursetvesbe-
hind our leaders to achieve the
freedom of this country, Let us

The colonisers create a situation

blinded all Caprivians so that they
have failed to recognise developmen-

WITH THE recent propaganda
against Swapo onthe part of the DTA
mouthpiece, | would like to bring the
following to the attention of the
public.

The facts about Swapo in that
mouthpiece are manipulated and
propagandistic in nature. The whites
who sit behind this propaganda are
exploiting the lack of knowledge of
our people. i

In 1899 to 1902 the Afrikaners
fought the Boer war. Let me mention
some factors in connection with this:

* the guerrilla war of 1899 to 1902 was
the tirst significant one in Africa:
“it was learned from them that guns
Could be taken upasa last resort and
when all other possibilities had been
exhausted;

* H-year old children fought in that
war;

* with their Calvanistic back ground,
they saw their war as rightful before
God;

* the Afrikaners did not Separate
politics and religion;

* they were convinced they fought for
their country and freedom,

* the homes and farms of the

Afrikaners were burned down by the
enemy British;

* women and children were placed in
concentration camps, where more
than 22000 children under the age of

16 are alleged to have died;

* Hensoppers were regarded as
traitors while bittereindes fought to
the finish;

* the traitors were sometimes

sentenced to death by firing squad;

* the Afrikaners were distrustful of
the English and thetr peace
imitiatives:

* children of traitors could not be
baptised in the Dutch Reformed
Church.

Taking this into account, why the
fuss about the fact that Swapo ts
holding their traitors tn detention, in
uch better condinions than these of
“he Afrikaners during the Boer War?

Already, deep in the National Par-
ty hierarchy, inthe NP church, there
iy a change against apartheid. They
are now beginning to realise the ir-
reparable damage done to the black
by means of apartheid.

View the propaganda of the
Republican Party with caution. Itis
the Broederbond’s psychological
war against Swapo. Swapo will not
be broken. Shipanga and Muyongo
tried it and failed. Do you think
Maria Boois and Beukes will get it
right?

THE CHURCH is the body of
Christ and it is the responsibility of
the church to act in the spiritual,
social and political interests of the
community.

The Church should acknowledge
that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is to
be understood, not only in an ec-
clesiaslical sense, but also in the
social, political and cultural sense.

The task of the Church is to work
for God's reconciliation everywhere.

The Church hasa responsibility to
reject government policies which
deny people their human rights and
it must speak out against injustice
and preach the Chnstian message of
peace, freedom and reconciliation.

It should reject racial discrimina-
dion and racism and put forth renew-

ed efforts to live according to Biblical
norms. It should press the govern-
ment to promote fundamental
human rights, freedom and peace
among the people.

The Church is responsible for the
welfare of its people. It cannot re-
main uninvolved because the people
under the government are also
members of the church.

The Church has to realise that the
situation in this country is contrary
to the will of God. It has to struggle
for radical change in our society - for
genuine independence for Namibia.

ngIP2E283JPQ7JZgvJh05RPRMJhXyQvFXJQs7MPg,"Colonel Eimbeck reacts to opinions of Pastor Kameeta

YOU HAVE GIVEN Vice Bishop
Kamecta space in your newspaper to
volce his opinion. I request thesame
Opportunity since you call yourself
achamplon for freedom of speech.

Mr Kameceta claims that the in-
dependence of Namibia is an in-
alienable right, and that itisdemand-
ed without conditions attached. He
iscight, but why does he, and his par-
ty, Swapo, refuse to acknowledge any
other political opinion in this de-
mand for independence?

Why doesn't Mr Kameeta use his
high office to ensure justice, peace
and freedom for eery Namibian?
He is aware of the fact that Swapo
does not tolerate opposition. He
knows that everybody opposing
Swapo will be subject to arbitrary
punishment or even execution
without a fair trial. Mr Kameeta
should support the call made by The
Namibian on Swapotoensurea fair
hearing for those who are accused of
being spies for South Africa.

Mr Kameeta should be aware of
the fact that many political parties in
Nainibia have urged Swapoto be an
equal partner in their opposition to
South Africa. He should also know
that Swapo refuses to drop the adjec-

tive ‘sole and authentic represen.

tative of the people of Namibia’. Ms
Lister should inform Mr Kameeta of
what her experiences are concerning
this imposed status on Swapo. Mr
Kameeta, who has vowed to preach
love, peace and righteousness,
should be inthe front to ensure that
every Namibia be granted the right
andthe opportunity to work towards
independence of this country.

Mr Kameeta knows that Swapo
regards violence as the only viable
means of allaining independence tor
Namibia, but does he consider the
fact that the majority people in this
country are peaceloving Christians
and thus prefer a negotiated
settlement?

Mr Kamecta calls for boycotts and
disinvestment and calls the potential
suffering of the majority of people
‘empty phrases’. Simullaneously this
Vice Bishop demands that ‘all peo-
ple must have the right to decent
housing, and bring up their families
incomfort and secunty. Free medica!
care and hospitalisation must be pro-
vided for all, with special care for

senior citizens, mothers and small
children. The aged and disabled must
be fully cared for by the State’,

Has it occurred to Mr Kameeta
that foreign investment is vital to
achieve these aims” Mr Kameeta ts
fully aware of the fact that Swapo
and the CCN regularly call on inter-
national financial support to
alleviate the plight of the people.
Why then should only his party and
is followers benefit from financial
aid and not the majority of the
people?

Will Mr Kameeta care to tell the
public how much he earns and how
much he pays i taxes? Will Mr
Kamecta be prepared to inform the
people of this country about the
lifestyle of those who profess to fight
tor independence and liberation
about ther contribution towards the
alleviation of the suffering peaplein
the form of financial contributions?

Can Mr Kamectainform the publicof

whathe proposes shauld be done to
obtain sufficient funds to attain what
all the people in Namibia desire?
Mr contention is that Swapo is
guilty of the most atrocious
discrimination against people. Mr
Kameeta is actively engaged in
Swapo's political activities, this
inakes him guilty of discriminating
against his own people too, Accor-

ding to the Oxford dictionary,
discrimination means to ‘make a
distinction, to give unfair treatment,
especially because of prejudice’.
Swapo and Mr Kameeta call
everybody who does not comply with
their conditions and with their opi-
mons, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pels etc. Everybody who dares to
speak against Swapo is threatened
and intimidated. Every person who
does not support Swapo is being
discriminated against. This ts
definitely not what the majority of
Namibians will support: this is what
the majority ofthe Namubians want
eradicated,

Mr Kameecta claims his fame and
right to speak about political matters
on his attest and detention. For any
law-abiding citizen, especially for
devoted Christians, defiance of the
lawis detestable. If Mr Kamectaasa
Vice Bishop and even more as a
Swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
ahenable right to self-determination,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not suppartan
organisation which sees only
violence as a moans of achieving

what they desire, namely, to take over
power of this country.
Mr Nujoma has declared more

than once that Swapo is not in-
\erested in powersharing, but onlyin
power itself, During his recent pro-
paganda tour for Swapo in West Ger-
many, Mr Kameeta has proven that
heis against any form of opposition
to Swapo and that he disputes the
right of freedom of speech of a Ger-
man citizen in his own country. With

this act added to his political antics

against the people of this country, Mr

Kameeta has disqualified himselfof
claiming to be a champion for
freedom, justice and peace.

ALLOW ME to react to the rude
speech of the socalled Minister of
Health in the interim government,
Mr Moses Katjiuongua. (The
Namibian, May 4 1986).

The said Mr Katjiuongua was in
a state of desperation when mak-
ing this ndiculous speech, and thus
apparently did not realise his use of
uncivilised language in describing
his political opponents.

He called our leaders ‘power
drunkards, political jokers and op-
portunists’. Now to examine the
issue seriously, who is an oppor-

tunist and who is not? Why did you
run away from Swanu [o join the
MPC government? Is that not op-
portunistic and power-hungry?

You try to fool the people by tell-
ing them you don’t want a civil war
in Namibia. Is it not a civil war
which ts beng fought in the north?

Mr Katjiuongua, try and address
yourself to the real facts and pull
yourself out of that pool of
stupidity. .

It you try to be objective and
realistic, you would not be worried
about the positive actions of pro-

gressive parties aimed at the speedy
implementation of Resolution 43$.

People know what you stand for
and your empty promises of a ‘new
deal’ will not make the people
suscepuble to this cheap propagan-
da. You and your colleagues are
ruled by apartheid and confusion
and this makes you more reckless
than ever.

If you consider yourself a na-
tionalist, why do you not push for
the implementation of Resolution
435 and your Bill of Rights?

If you stay as you are, a short-

assure you that there will be no
tranquility in Namibia as long as
we are being ruled by a foreign
power through the MPC. The
MPC government should be
abolished and replaced by a
democratically-elected government.

You cannot claim peace in a state
of continuous institutionalised
State violence and unemployment.
People need freedom, peace and

security and not torture and deten-

tion without tril. Give the people
what they want by granting them

their right to practice self

determination.

Why should you be afraid of
Resolution 435 if you ‘claim’ the
support of the people?

Lastly, I] would suggest you use
more civihsed language when mak-
ing public statements, because you
are causing ill-feeling among the

False statement

PLEASE permit me to answer to
the embarrassing statement
Swapo does the same, but nobody
complains .... in The Namibian of
May 16.

The angry residents and their
tribal chief, in and around Om-
balantu in northern Namibia, are
totally against the actions of the
South African Police and Defence
Force and not against Swapo.

Obviously the people in the
north are annoyed by the South
Afncan Police and Defence Force’s
“systematic and cleverly planned’
manner of waiting until the
harvesting period before these units
come in and destroy their many
months of hard work.

In Windhoek, the Police
spokesman’s comment on the in-
cidents, in my reasoning, is alarm-
ing. His words ‘... Swapo does the
same but nobody complains ..’ are
absurd and embarrassing and
perhape deliberately said to ignore
the complaints and the truth of the

The statement ‘Swapo does the
same’ is patently false since Swapo

has no military vehicles, which ac-
cording to the complaints, the
SADF drove through mahangu
fields and homesteads. How can
someone from the north be ex-
pected to believe such a statement?

While the police and army claim
to be the defenders of the people,
the Namibians themselves have re-
jected this claim, since Namibians
have experienced untold crimes at
the hands of these forces. These
cannot be erased from our minds

We do fear the action of these
forces and call for the immediate
withdrawal of South African police
and army. We want peace, justice
and truth and this can be im-
plemented through Resolution 435.

NAMIBIAN independence is
delayed by the entire western world
with their intentions of exploiting
our country's natural resources and
promoting the iNegal occupation of
Namibia by the South African
Government.

In 1978 the United Nations pass-
ed a Resoluuon (UNSCR 435)
which was to pave the way for our
independence through UN-
supervised elections.

Both Swapo and South Africa
had agreed to the implementation
of Resolution 435, but when
Reagan came {0 power in
Washington, he and South Africa
brought in the linkage issue. This
is NOW made a precondition to our
independence.

The Cuban Internationalists
have been in Angola almost three
years prior to the introduction of
Resolution 435. They were only
found to be a threat after six years.

This is a feeble excuse and ploy
by western capitalists regarding
Namubia.

We in Namibia have tried on-
three occasions to bring and end to
the shedding of blood and the suf-
fering of our people, but all were
in vain. In Geneva in 1981, Swapo
was ready to sign a ceasefire and
put Resolution 435 into operauion,
and this was repeated in Lusaka in
1984 and on Cape Verde later that
year, but the South African
Government turned a deal ear.

Mr P W Botha told the world
that Swapo was the one delaying
independence and opting for
violence, whereas Swapo had stated
often that a ceasefire was the only
way to end the war.

If Mr P W Botha could just tell
us openly that he is afraid of a
Swapo victory if Resolution 438 ts
implemented. Swapa would win
the elections overwhelmingly,
which 16 why the Reagan Adc-
ministrauon is backing Pretoria on
the Cuban tssue.

The South African Government
Is again playing with us by saying
that Swapo must talk to the interim
government in Windhoek. Why
should Swapo talk to their sur-
rogates? The country is not oc-
cupied by Mudge-Shipanga-
Katjiuongua, but by Pretoria.

the skin colour be ‘white’.

The man with the black skin had
to keep away from ‘your’ regions
and reservations.

1 will not ask what you have
against the colour of my skin, Mr
Becker. By maintaining this rigid
attitude, you have made your
message clear to the blacks of
Namibia. As far as you are con-
cerned, there is no compromise on
apartheid without a colour change.

ironically, the very segregation
you are now seeking, was provid-
ed in the past. Someone was wise
enough to foresee conflicting
nature of the white man and black
man, and kept them apart. Your
forbears were in Holland and there
the chances of keeping vour race
pure, were perfect

On what grounds can you now
fence in the black man to safeguard
the punty of your white race if you,
yourself, have broken the natural
segregation by crossing the ocean?

Of course we dare not overlook
the fact that your forbears brought
the first hight of Christian faith and -
civilisation into the most southern *
part of Africa. This opened our
eyes (o new horizons of education,
civilisation, faith and progress.

Incidentally, the white man also
introduced to us the first spark of
the gun, the very evil he suffers
under today. In fact the mass
slaughter of blacks on December 16
1836, is a testive day for your
government - contrary to the Chris-
Han faith which strives for peace,
love and unity.

You came to Africa, heavily
armed and with apartheid.

Surely you are an advocate of
‘whites only’ churches, a religion
practised, understood and accep-
(able to only a small part of the
community. With the help of God
we have partly outgrown that stage.

Lastly Mr Becker, your thoughts
Jo not justify your existence in
Africa, unless you change them
and bring them into the open. —

RETARY

ALLOW ME to express my views
on Messrs Andreas Shipanga,
Moses Katjiuongua, and Fanuel
Kozonguizi, about their positions
and what they are doing to the sul-
fering Namibian people.

As a brother and fellow coun-
tryman, I would be guilty if | did
not state my views in regard to your
present positions, labelled as
cabinet ministers by an unelected
interim government appointed by
the South African Government, be-
ing used as carriers of apartheid
and collaborators of the South
African Government; and being us-
ed to oppress the already oppress-
ed suffering Namibian people, your
own people, your own blood.

Did you know you are delaying
the country’s independence by
allowing yourselves to be used by
the South African Government
which is still exploiting our natural

civilian population. :

How did you feel at the. time,
giving approval to an army of
occupation?

Brothers, 1 want to remind you
that your forerunners, ard others
who have sold out to the enemy,
are forgotten, and were
like rotten fruit to the dustbin. You
should seriously reconsider your
positions in opposing your own
people.

You know you don’t have the
support of even two percent of the
Namibian people, so please open
the doors for Resolution 435 to
clect our leaders. We know them
well.

My message (Oo peace-loving
Namibians is that they should unite
and fight the darkness of evil
among us. Let us fight for our
future generations, and leave
money and cars to the sellouts.

{ AM an Ovambo-speaking man
who is very disappointed male his
fellow countrymen.

1 was told I could get a job i in the
building construction industry in
Tsumeb, and had to see a man at
the Tsumeb Municipality. He told
me to come back the following
morning at 07h00, which I did, and
he made me wait all day. I was
eventually told I could not get the
job, and then after a friend of mine
again requested, I was told to go
to the Municipality once again.

When | did so, the man told me
there were no jobs for Ovambo-
speaking people, but only
Damaras, Namas and Coloureds.

Some of our brothers in govern-
ment offices treat others on a tribal
and discriminatory basis. While the
Ovambo-speaking people are those
who are suffering the most, one has
to hear that they are ‘thieves and
terrorists’, and they are
discriminated against in job
situations.

| had used my own money to go
to Tsumeb for that job, and had no
place to sleep and nothing to eat.

Blacks always blame the whites
for discrimination and racism, but
some of our own people, like the
one who dealt with me at the
Municipality, are oppressing their
own people.

We should learn from these
mistakes so we should not make the
same mistakes tn the future.

Our country is torn by war and
this situation will only be resolved
if the people of the country can
work hand in hand for peace. This
peace will only come through love,
and an understanding of our duty
to the nation, and if we forget the
differences among ourselves and
see one another as brothers and

Sanctions: Yes

THRE CALL tor total cconomic
sanctions against apartherd South
Atnica is justified. South Africa has
rejected all reasonable demands to
do away with the outdated and
degrading system of apartheid and
oppression of the blacks.

The promoters of economic
sanctions have the real interests of
the oppressed masses of South
Africa and Namibia at heart; and
economic sancuons is the alter-
native to total war. In fact
economic sanctions is a call for
‘peaceful change’ to enable the
blacks to govern in the land of their
birth and creation.

Those who are against economic
sanctions are only trying to protect
their own interests and exploitation
of the blacks. The claim that the
blacks would suffer if economic
sancuions were applied, should be
rejected with the contempt it
deserves. The blacks are suffering
already and additional temporary
suffering won’t matter to us as long
as freedom is achieved.

The blacks have no economic in-
terests to protect and defend - their
main interest NOW is to liberate
themselves at all costs.

The US and British attitude is
Clearly capitalistic and self-interest
aimed at protecting the in-
vestments. The fear of economic
loss is stronger to them than the
freedom and lives of the blacks in
apartheid South Africa. It ig
because of the double standards of
the Western powers that blacks
have lost interest in slogans like
‘democracy’ Blacks lived in peace
and harmony until the arrival of
the white settlers and colonisers.

It fills one with dismay to hear
about blacks saying that apartheid
is dead in Namibia. Apartheid in
Namibia as still alive and kicking,
even the socalled black ‘ministers’
complain about apartheid meted
outto them by secretaries of other
“Mintsters’,

The abolition of apartheid is not
what we are calling for - we are not
fighting for reforms - we want to
GOVERN this country. We are
fighting for the nght to decide our
own destiny and our destiny 1s not
linked to apartheid or neo-
colomalism.

The whites of this country are
not prepared to change or ready
themselves for change. They still
believe in their oppressive doctrines
und dogmas.

Even the Secretary for Finance
is calling for methods to prepare
against economic sanchons, instead
of calling for drastic changes in the
status quo in order to meet the
reasonable demands of the op-
pressed masses.

The whites must remember one
thing: they may be in a temporary
postion to delay independence. Dut
thes cannot present

The whites are shouting that they
ate Hehting on the border (o defend
them rotten sytem of apartheid.
They should femember that we
never invited them here with their
oppressive system, and now they
ure calling on us blacks to defend
and fight to retain oppression and
apartheid.

We hear that the army 1s 80 per-
cent black and 20 percent white -
but who are the 20 percent? They
are the elite, the white officers, the
ones in charge. The 80 percent
blacks are there only to run errands
and to be ordered to kill their own
kith and kin.

If the whites are prepared to die
for what is not theirs, what about
us who have a country to regain
and a people to liberate? Whites
should remember that violence
breeds violence - they have practis-
ed violence since the first white
man put his foot on Namibian soil
and have not stopped ever since. In
fact they have accelerated it. Blame
for any violence or bloodshed
should be placed squarely at the
door of the whites.

AN OPEN LETTER TO DR
ABISAI SHEJAVALI

NEITHER YOU, Dr Shejavali, nor any
of your colleagues of the Council of
Churches (CCN) have as yet reacted to
the barbarous bomb attack on innocent
civilians in Walvis Bay on August 2.
Nobody expects you as a Christian to
take sides in the struggle over
SWA/Namibia, but as a christian you
should condemn all forms of violence.
You did not and have never before con-
demned violence and atrocities commit-
ted by Swapo and therefore | take it for
granted that vou condone one form of
violence and condemn another suiting
your own political whims and
aspirations.

As the majority of my countrymen
I condemn violence of any form to
achieve political aims. Nobody denies
that members of the security forces do
commit violence against members of the
local population. Such members are
however brought before court and | can
substantiate this statement with a list of
trials. | do however assume that you
doubt the impartiality and in-
dependence of our courts of law.
However it may be there is not one case
Swapo has brought before a couriof

civilians.

On the’ contrary: Swapo cold-
bloodediy murder a mother and young
child in Grootfontein. The same peo-
ple killed two parents in front of their
two daughters on a farm near Okahan-

to death and subsequently hanged,

I would personally like to call

‘Koevoetura’

OUR residential area, Katutura, is

While the idea of keeping an eye on
this area with a view to curbing
crime is acceptable, the consequences

of their presence here is such that

many people get assaulted

In so doing the police are no longer
doing what they are supposed to do.

ed by strong hunting lamps.

It makes one feel that Katutura is
nothing but a game reserve where
people go to ‘hunt’.

more gently with the inhabitants of

then let an arrest be made, rather .
than random assaults. The problem 7

I] WOULD like to respond to a report
in the interim government propagan-
da mouthpiece of November 3, which
criticised church-run schools in the
territory.

Mr Andrew Matjila, Education
Minister, said that we were disad-
vantaged hecause we were
undernourished.

Church schools are contributing
much to our country, and our eves
and minds are kept open in these
schools. We have a fair system of
education, and we feel at home.

Coming to Mr Matjila’s point that
we are locked into our hostels: this
is not true. Everyone has the right
to go home with the permission of
staff members, and this is a sign of
order. We are protected by the church
as future leaders of this country. .

Truly speaking, we are thankful for
the good we are getting. We eat in
order to survive and not to get fat as
he is doing. If he wants to make us
fat, then they have to implement a
system of equal education in this
country.

Mr Matjila should also not confuse
himself about Swapo and the Coun.
cil of Churches. They are using the
money for peaceful means, while he
and his colleagues have grabbed
possession of the country, including
the education system.

He and his colleagues spent a for-
tune on military training, while peo-
ee are dying. Leave church schools

where the supporters of Swapo were

here as Koevoet.

I was invited to the peace rally (sic)

It was quite an experience. People
singing and dancing, a group of
children splendidly dressed in Swapo
colours, dancing to the tune of a whia-

Swapo police! Dreesed resplendently,
some with wooden AK-47 rifles,
painted blue, green and red. Tradi-
tional kieries and spears (covered with
cooldrink cans to make gure the sharp
points cause no incidental harm).

The peace rally was opened with o
prayer. An old black man, praying in
Afrikaans, for the rally to be peaceful
and in the name of God. There were
some speeches and then a group of
socalled vigilantes started injuring
people and damaging cars in the road.
They were chased away by the Swapo
police and we all started singing again,
determined to allow peace to get the
upper hand.

blatant distortion of the truth. The
allegation against Mr Shapua

not surprised by these lies, because
a system based on lies, cannot be
defended with the truth.

l repeat my statement made in the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in
Katutura at Mr Shifidi's funeral that
the “socalled government of national
unity is morally responsible for his
death”. The death of Mr Shifidi is an
urgent call on this ‘government’ to
step down, and in so doing, allow the
implementation of UNSC Resolution
435.

As long as this ‘government’ is in
power, it will be responsible for the
blood of the Namibians which has
been soaking the soil for more than
a century. What happened on that
fateful Sunday of November 30 last
year was not a mere ‘bakleiery’ as
that newspaper pretends. which is
why we are demanding an indepen-
dent judicial commission of inquiry
to reveal the truth.

I challenge Mr Eben van Zijl and
his government to allow the appoint-
ment of such a commission if ita (the
government) conscience is clear on
what happened that day.

Without justice there will be no
reconciliation and peace in Namibia.

For us, the
masses of Namibia, i it is now time to
reflect on the happenings of the past
year. Waa it a successful year as far
_ as the struggle is concerned? Did we
achieve what we set out to achieve,
and if not why?

First of all we must find answers
to these questions before we can plan
for the new year. The aim of our plan-

should be to make a success out
of failures of the past and to
achieve our independence. It is aleo
now time for us to state our aims and
purpose as clearly as never before.
We should state our views without
fear or favour.

Our aim was and is and always
shall be the independence of our
country. It must be every Namibian’s
wish and desire to be free ... and |
mean free in the real sense of the
word.

Our independence is not
negotiable. We have negotiated for
too long hence the long delay in ob-
taining our desired independence.
Our direction should be very clear ...
independence now and at all costs.
We should stop these half-hearted ef.
forts. We should go all out to liberate
our country.

The call and onus is on us to unite
the divided people of Namibia into
one cohesive liberation front or
movement.

The unity I am talking about is not
unity for the sake of shouting that we
are united ... 1 mean unity of purpose
and action ... the purpose being our
liberation. We must have the purpose
of fighting the common enemy and
even more ... to defeat the enemy. We
have nothing to lose but our chains.

We must learn from our mistakes
and those of our forefathers and rec-
tify them before it is too late. We

6 1987, written by Mr Clive Algar,
Rossing Uranium's public affairs

representative, Mr Helmut Angula,
of making ‘extravagant statements’

First and foremost I would like to
hear from Mr Algar who has
authorised Rossing to mine uranium
in Namibia. According to my sources,
this company was given a green light
by South Africa in 1970, four years
after the UN General Assembly
revoked South Africa’s mandate to
rule Namibia. Was Rossing ignorant
of UN Decree Number 1 which clear-

ACCORDING to a report published
in the Republikein of March 6 1987,
interim government Minister, An.
dreas Shipanga, ‘sharply criticised’
and expressed his ‘disappointment’
about certain statementa the Vicar
General of the Roman Catholic
Church, Father Bernhard Nor-
dkamp, had allegedly made during
an address given at a youth seminar,
which, again according to the report,
is said to have been organised by the
Council of Churches. The report
relates to what Mr Shipanga 1s alleg.
ed to have said during a meeting of

the National Assembly on March 5

1987.

Mr Shipanga, according to the
report, bases his claim about what

the Vicar General had said during

the youth seminar held at Dobra, on

a letter by an unidentified “Win-

- published in the Windhoek Observer

of February 28, 1987. The “student”
alleges, inter alia, that Father Nor-

- dkamp had said that “law and order
are sin”. For the purposes of this

statement it is sufficient to state that
the letter contains further very
serious distortions and outright un-
truths. It represents nothing but a
very ill-considered attempt to amear
the Roman Catholic Church and to
discredit the Vicar General, whose
commitment to bringing about
justice with peace in a truly Chris-

The authors would do well to
emulate Dr Perez de Cuellar’s honest
concern on these points instead of echo-
ing Swapo's hoary ploy of pointing to
“South African partiality” as a means
of diverting attention from them. All
thinking Namibians know by now that
South Africa - like any country - is
focuasing on the protection of its own
interests, not those of any Namibian
party. The recent contreternps between
the Administrator General and the
Cabinet following Mr Pienaar's
speech, serves to underline this.

The fact that South Africa's interesta
are not at stake here, probably explains
why that government formally aban.
doned its demand for UN impartial.
ty in August 1983. The fact that our in.
terests are at stake explains why
Namibian parties who do not enjoy the
benefits of UN bias, continue to make
this demand.

Why press for negotiation and
reconciliation before  in-

Andtoelect such representatives of

of their self-determination and right
to independence, 1s the very aim and

After the constitution so drawn up by
the elected representatives, there
could be a further election forthe first
government of Namibia in terms ofthe
agreed constitution That willineffect

for a Namibian government

In the case of Namibia. however.
there already exists an international
ayreement.on the inclusion of certain
specified constitutional principles and
fundamental human rights in the
future constitution of Namibia and
also safeguards for the protection of
minorities in the form ofa provision for
proportional representation and for
the further details of the constitution
to be decided upon by at least a two
thirds majority

So itis clear that even here a com-
promise hus already been reached
between those who want a constitution
first and those who want an election
before a constitution

Swapo hasconsistently stood by the
peace plan and the democratic elec:
tions provided for in it, whereas
Minister Kozonguiz:. Minister
Shipanga and others show no sign of
suggesting anv sort of country-wide
elections to legitimise their appoint

Africa are moving in the direction of

The Honourable Minister of Justice
has often inthe past reiterated thatin
Africa power comes from the barrel ot

of his associates have accepted this
credo.

It seems futile to argue with the

I WISH to air my disappointment
about the issue of permits to the
travelling public between Rundu and
the Caprivi.

Fellow Namibians, it hurts tosee the
travelling public suffering likethey do
inthe country of their birth. Ever since
the introduction of the issue of permits
by the SADF eight years ago, it seems
that Namibians are not much concern-
ed about it.

The permits in question is not a
statutory law ofthecountry butrather
an imaginary law introduced by the ar-
my to cause severe hardship to Capri-
vians and the travelling public.

The army should immediately and
unconditionally do away with the issue
of permits, for if not, Namibians will
be left with nooption than tochallenge
the validity of the permits in acourt of
law. Members of the travelling public
are checked and their clothing left in
the dust road, after every 50km stretch
from Bagani to Kongola.

A poor Caprivian motorist with his
family, was travelling from Katima
Mulilo to Windhoek and at the
Kongola army checkpoint was ordered
todrive 120km back to Katima to have
his provision of fish written on the
socalled permit. He had torefill hiscar
with petrol for a second time although
the permit in question does not
stipulate the inclusion of provisions of
any kind. Though you are in possession
of the permit, it does not offer you pro-
tection of any kind, because it is
stipulated that youtravel at yourown
risk. What is the use of carrying
something that does not give you any
protection? What is the use of iden-
tification cards issued to Namibians
and residents? The behaviour of Up-
ingtonians and people trom the Cape
is intolerable and they must be sent
back to where they came from.

I appeal to all peaceloving church
organisations, progressive political
parties, and Namibiansboth and
white, to stand up and apeak out
against the issue of permits between
Rundu and Caprivi. .

It seems that many of those people
are cowardly rather than brave, and
this is why they attack innocent
civilians rather than delinquents.

Whatever they do, apartheid will one

On anti-Swapo

ON JUNE 9, I received anonymous
anti-Swapo literature. I have learned
that the literature has ‘»een circulated

ing members of Swapo in the Kavango.

What surprised me is that this
literature is the act of a coward, since
the documentation is not attributed or
named. The literature is full of mixed
texts extracted from various unknown
newspapers accompanied by a poor
Rukwangali version. It is also full of
anti-Nujoma statements such as ‘Nu-
joma het geslaan’, and ‘Vuishou 'n
akok’, to mention but a few.

Some Swapo executives in Kavango
were warned about what they were do-
ing. There is also a page of pictures of
eight people, probably emanating from
the socalled Parents Committee, with
question marks. These eight people
are those they believe have been ex-
semted by the movement.

According to news reports around
25 000 people are benefiting from an
emergency feeding scheme. The
Department of National Health and
Welfare, and private welfare organiza-
tions, like the Red Crogs are involved.
While having sympathy with
hungry people, and supporting the ef:
forts to help, we have to ask ourselves,
“Why are these people starving”. The
following problems are contributing to
the problem viz:
A) Population Growth:
The annual population growth hovers
around three percent. Fifty percentof
the population is 15 years or younger,
and therefore unproductive. Between
© to 10 percent are retired and no
longer make a contribution. Present-
ly only 20 percent ofthe population are
gainfully economically employed, and
of this group, one quarter works for the
State. The balance 20-25% are either
subsistence farmers or unemployed.
The population growth ou tstrips
food production, housing resources,
schooling, Health services and job crea-
tion. As @ result the population
becomes poorer and poorer, and the
economically active group smaller in
proportion. It is always tempting in an
effort toredistribute wealth, to heavi-
ly tax this group. Care must however
be taken not tokill the goose that lays
the golden eggs.
B) Drought:
Namibia isasemi-desert country and
droughts are part of life. The problem
arises when the odd few good rainfal]
years are taken asthe norm and no pro-
vision is made for the inevitable bad
years in nature's cycle.
C) Farming Methods:
Farming methodsaresometimes very
destructive, especially in the com-
munal areas. There, no rotation graz-
ing is implemented and very little con-
trol is exercised over stock numbers.
Traditionally the number of cattle iB
a symbol of wealth, irrespective of their
condition. Owners are alsooften loathe
to sell their cattle, even in times of
drought, with resultant destruction of
grazing and death, as witnessed a few
years ago in Kaokoveld. The result ig
the same as in the Sahel region in
North Africa. Man has totally upset
the delicate balance of nature for short
term gain, with longterm destructive
results, |

I WISH to express my point of view con-
cerning the recent visit of high-
ranking South African Government
Ministers to Namibia. One wonders
why they do this because it has no
meaning for Namibians. Isit possible
that South Africa’s Defence Minister
could concern himself with the Con-
stitutional Council?

Did they come here to talk about the
real situation in Namibia, or did they
come to give instructions to their
pawns in the interim government? Did
they come to re-inforce the curfew
restrictions? What is the purpose of
protecting a minority when they
disregard the wishes of the majority?

Namibians are suffering daily, long-
ing for independence, crving for self-
determination and implementation of
Resolution 435; but our humandigni-
ty is detrimentally affected by the
socalled SA DF and SWATF. the latter
created illegally in our country.

lfeeltheir visit was a provocation to
the oppressed people of Namibia, and
those who welcomed them here must
be people who have lost interest in
Namibian affairs.

Let SA leave Namibia in peace; let
them give the Namibians what they
want and forget about creating confu-
sion with an appointed, unrecognised
government which works under SA
control.

Their daily Afrikaans language
mouthpiece. instead of exposing the
realities, hinders the truth and
misleads the people. This propaganda
has no benefit toour nation. Why don't
they wanttotest the peoples’ willina

Swapo has been willing to sign an ar-
mistice with the Pretoria regime and

Mr Mungunda? Swapo did not glorify
war, but was forced to take up arms
against those you praise.

THERE IS a considerable number of
Namibians who really do not unders-

which we are going, particularly with
regard to the armed struggle against
the colonial occupation of this country
by the SA regime. The socalled Verip1
Mungunda is one of them.

In his letter dated July 17, he made
serious, irresponsible and reactionary
statements. Inthe first one, he alleges
that Swapo has no popular supporter.
1, the writer of this letter, would like to
challenge him to travel through the
country and test the popular support
of Swapo by questioning the masseson
the credibility of Swapoasa liberation
movement. If he did this, he would
definitely clear out his brainwashed
mind.

As far as his second statement iscon-
cerned; which implies that Swapo
makes use of the Council of Churches
and Namibian facilities in order to
carry out its political activities, my
question is: is their anything wrong
with it? Is it wrong for peace loving peo-
ple and genuine Namibiansto gather
together, to thrash out the good from
the bad? No, Mr Mungunda. Once
again, you're confused. In the Nami-

‘bian context the CCN and The Nami-

bian’s Editor forms the good, while the
alliance between the Namibia Chur-

bad.

and that they would use only some
uninhabited parts of Namibia for
cooperative projects. Are we tostick to
the Namib Desert and Khomas
Hochland with our ‘cooperative’ pro-
jects a la socialism? Not at all.

The grand children of Maharero,
Mandume and Witbooi are still wag-
ing the war against the racist South
African Government to regain their
land. There must be noquestion about
it. Our forebears gave their lives in
defence of our land and the present
generation is also sacrificing their
lives to regain the land from the white
oppressors. As long as our land re-
mains in the hands of the present
white monopoly farmers, there can be
and there will be no peace and stabili-
ty in Namibia.

The questionofland isa very serious
matter which lies at the heart of our
struggle. The whites will continue to
control our economy ifthey retain the
land and our freedom will be in name
only ... something like the MPC is
claiming today. That will be a sham
freedom within poverty, white domina-
tion and exploitation of our wealth.
Such independence is definitely not
worth fighting for.

We must fight for the land and all our
natural resources. I believe that thisis
the only solution for the black majori-
ty of Namibians. The whites are still
controlling thefarms and the economy
in Zimbabwe and those who fought
during the war are not satisfied at pre-
sent. The Zimbabwean government is
trying to solve this problem which |
realise is a very difficult task at this
stage. This is why in the case of
Namibia we must grab our in-
dependence in terms ofthe ownership
of land. We must show to have learned
the lessonsof African history. The land
belongs tothe people of Africa and not
to those who call themselves ‘Euro-
peans’ in Namibia.

We cannot promise our sacred land
to the very same white farmers who
support the all-apartheid white Na-
tional Party of settlers in Namibia. We
cannot give our land to those who, in
the May 6 elections this year, return-
ed P W Botha to powerinordertopro-
tect their minority rights in Namibia.
We cannot give our land to white
farmers who train Koevoet and who
are themselves commando members
in the South African army.

Since whites do not compromise on
any issue so far, why should we com-
promise our birthright? The masses of
our people shall take over the land
from the white monopoly capitalists
with or without compensation.

regarding the socalled Owambo an-

..L] These announcers are blinded and

They are used as instruments by SA to

bians. They appear to keep silent on
the deaths in units such as SA DF,
SWATF and Koevoet. Furthermore
they urge people to believe the latter
suffer no casualties.
i: Female announcersare guilty ofthe
same things.
i. Most of these announcers have
become resident in the towns of
Oshakati and Ondangua and hardly
visit their places or origin. They are
fully disconnected from the nation. If
they are on a reporting mission, then
they are given an army escort.

Saluting Ponhofi

I WOULD like to air my views on the
socalled leaders of Uukwanyamr’sre-
centcal for army reinforcement inthe
region.

In the first place, I would like to
salute my comrades, fellow students of
Ponhofi Secondary School, who called
upon the SADF to withdraw from the
region, in particular the Ovambo Ad.
ministration and many other victims
of the racist Pretoria regime.

Inthe second place I would like to in.
form Messrs Kwautima, Dan and
Nghihulifwa and their disciples inthe
region that we want freedom and not
an extension and intensification of up.
Ppreesion and victimisation as is the
case in the north Presently. If Mr

Kwautima genuinely wants freedom
and security then he should fight for
the implementation of Resolution 435.

Itseems thatthe menin question do
not know what Resolution 435 is. They
simply believe that Koevoet will bring
stability in the region.

If Kwautima, Nghihulifwa and their
followers cannot exist without the ar-
my and Koevoet, then they should go
together with them, and leave Nami-
brans in peace.

Kwautima claimed over Radio
Owambo that even Chief Mandume
had soldiers. This may be, but Man-
dume did not fight his fellow Nami-
bians but fought the same colonialism
which we Namibians are fighting
against today. How can Kwautima
compare himself with a man like
Mandume?

Whatever Kwautima does. he and
his followers will never win the people's
hearts and minds. Students of Ponhofi,
you must not be intimidated by these
people. You must not surrender your
attitude of resistance tothe SADF We
are al] with you and behind you.

We shall not be intimidated by South

live in peace and tranquility and
should not be controlled by Swapo’s

vinced that the majority of those
workers were honest people who
desired to be employed and to earn
enough money to support their

IN THE WAKE of Christmas and my
dealings with The Namibian during
1987 I fee) myself competled to write
you this letter in my personal capaci-
ty in order toset the record straight on
the real meaning of the words peace
and goodwill.

After an in-depth study and research
on the reporting as presented by The
Namibian during the past year | come
to the conclusion that no objectivity
was portrayed by your newspaper con-
earning the South West Africa situa.
tion. Instead, you tried to portray the
enemy, Swapa including all tts wings
and associates as the “peace-seekers”
Nowhere could I find a call to stop ac.
tions by these organisations which are
detrimental to our country and all its
inhabitants, such as boycotts,
sabotage, etc. No, you rather opted to
go for the “alternative view’ of
revolution.

Let me give you only one example:
Justabout every week some kind of ac-
trocity by the security forces was
reported. The security forces spelt 1ot
out clearly that no atrocities by
members of the security forces
would be tolerated. Members who
are found guilty by a court of law will
be punished accordingly. However,
when Swapo claimed responsibility for
the bomb blast at the Gustav Voigts
Centre you reported it to be “a
demonstration of Namibian people's
resolve to shake off the yoke of col-
onialism by all necessary means”. Is
this promoting peace and goodwill?

Swapo opted for the revolutionary
methods some 21 years ago and let us
be honest, they've lost face, both
militanly and politically Although
you portray this organisation tobe the
“true liberatora” of this country, |
guarantee that freedom will be
something of the past IF they should
take over the reins. Howevar, that ia
hardly to be foreseen.

In you socalled “bumper edition’
dated December 18, 1987, to January
8, 1888, you predict another year of war
in your ’polstical perspective” column,
however, in the same breath you cal!
upon organisations and individuals
“to re-agsesa and come up with a con-
crete and effective plan of action to
break the chains in 1988 andreachthe
goal ofa free Namibia’ Thus, 1 accept
that you areatthesametime wishing
for peace and war. This isa contradic.
tion I'll never be able to understand

Please keep in mind: Swapo opted for
war. This is what they got. The securi-
ty forces were in being long before the
existence of Swapo and if you look at
the aim of any defence force in the
world, you will notice that their duty
{s, amongst other, the safeguarding of
life, property and freedom, During

1988 the security forces will maintain
this aim!

May | wish you not a worldly “hap:
py ‘festive season, but my prayers are
that you may also experience the love
of God towards mankind manifested
through the birth of His Son, our
Saviour and Lord, Jesus Christ, in
whom we trust to build the future of

because the Defence Force has
stated that “no atrocities by

report them at all. 1s this what you
define as ‘objectivity’? While on

contrary, in fact.

ALLOW me to express my heartfelt
disgust at Commandant G R C
Bester's childish, hopeless and self-
defeating comments which regularly
appear in this newspaper.

Asa patriotic and oppreesed Nami.
bian citizen, I really feel compelledto
respond to Commandant Bester’s
narrow-minded allegations against
the editor of this newspaper in par-
ticular and the entire oppressed but
fighting people of Namibia under the
leadership of Swapo.

I would like to make itcategorically
clear to Commandant Bester and his
masters in Pretoria that Swapo isthe
people of Namibia and the people are
Swapo. If South Africa is trying to
destroy Swapo, then they must be try-
ing to destroy the the suffering Nami-
bian people. But the apartheid regime
will not succeed in destroving the peo
ple’s movement. The apartheid govern
ment has been trying to bring Swapo
ta its knees for vears, but all therr ef-
forts were in vain

They have even tried to infiltrate the
organisation with spies, but none of
their dubious attempts have
succeeded.

Commandant Bester went on to ask
a foolsh and shortsighted question
“Who opted for revolution?” The
answer issimple and clear: Swapo. But
the next question to which he should
provide us witha proper answer is why
Swapo resorted to armed liberation
struggle.

Swapo Secretary General, Andimba
Toivo ya Toivo made the movement's
position clear in the Sixties: “Swapo
itself was a non-violent organisation.
but the South African government 13s
not truly interested in whether oppos!
tion is violent or non-violent. It does
not wish to hear any opposition to
apartheid”

Furthermore, Swapo President Sam
Nujoma. made clear the position of
Swapo with regard to the people's
revolution against colonial oppression
and exploitation at the WCC con.
ference in Lusaka last year. He said:

“On the question of violence, we make
no apology for the fact that afleracen-
tury of foreign oppression, genocidal
military campaigns and unbridled
economic exploitation, our movement
had decided totake up arms toconfront
colonial violence with armed self-
defence. It ig enshrined 1n our move-
mnent’s political programme that
Swapo does not glorify war We wish
that nobody hadever forced ustohave
to fight a war of national liberation

But the reality of prolonged colonial
oppression in Namibia being what it
is, we have been left wath no alter

nateve but to fight with armisin hand
for our liberty and right to self:
determination and independence To
those who would advise us not to fight
colonial oppression with armsin hand,
our answer is: ‘show us the available
non-violenl means to Namibia's rn

dependence and we shall fellow”

The available peaceful means to
Narnibian independence through UN
Resolution 435 has been deliberately
delayed by South Africa for ten years
Since 1981, the Swapo President has
expressed hia genuine willingness to
sign a ceasefire with the South African
regime any where in the world but in
Windhoek or Pretoria. But what was
the response of South Africa? They said
it was ‘premature’ to sign a ceasefire
with Swapo.

On socalled ‘atrocities’ allegedly
committed by Swapo against the
civilian population of this country, this
is wishful and baseless thinking on the
part of the people who have failed to

win the hearts and minds of the op-
pressed Namibians.

If Commandant Bester claims that
Swapo hag no support, then does he
think the over 3000 people whoattend
edthe recent Swapo public meeting in
Katutura were supporters of his
Government?

Commandant Bester cannot tell us
about the wavs and means as to how
Namibians should achieve freedom
and national independence, since the
whole history of the Afrikaners in
South Africa and Nannbia ig written
in blood How did they achieve their
self-determination from Britain?

Ithink itishigh trme Commandant
Bester stop writing rubbish to the peo-
ple’s newspaper and should rather
send his misleading and counter.
productive letters to the Koevoet
RKoerant

Lappeal to the editor not to publish
any more of his letters. He has access
toall necessary meansof propaganda
and should leave the-editor of this
newspaper and Dr A Shejavali of the
Council of Churches in peace.

t would like to close with the words
of va Toivo, whosaid that. “We believe
that South Afmea haga choice either
to live at peace with us or tosubdue us
by force. If you choose to crush us and
impose your willon us then you noton-
ly betray your trust, but you will live
in security for only so long as your
power is greater than ours. No South
Africa will live at peace in Namibia, for
each will know that hissecurity is bas-
ed on force, and that without force he
will face rejection by the people of
Namibia’.

SWAPO has nothing to do with the
bomb blast at Oshakati.lam only one
of the many Namibians who will
neither agree nor accept racist South
Africa's malicious propaganda cam-
paign against Swapo andthe people of
Namibia. South Africa through its
puppets and mass media continue to
deceive and mislead Namibians as to
the true situation in our country.

[ feel deeply hurt at the loss of lives
ofinnocentciviliansat Oshakat). Itis
not the first time that the people of
Namibia are intimidated, harrassed
and killed by the racists of Pretoria.

Who was responsible? There are
many instances as examples, 198]
bomb blast at Oshakati Post Office. for-
tunately noinjuries; 1998 bomb blast
at Okatana service Station, killing two
Americans and a local businessman,
Mr Nakambonde; 1985 bomb blast at
Ondanywa Post Office, killing many
people including children: 1985 bomb
blast at the Ongwediva Training Cen-
tre, fortunately nocasualties:; 1986 so-
meone tried to plant a bomb at Mr
Frans Indongo’s Continental Super-
market, fortunately he wascaught red-
handed and felt very ashamed: 1986
security forces tried to plant a bomb for
CDA President Peter Kalangula, but
this too failed.

Further still, there are many, many
Namibians who have either been kill-
edor whodisappeared,andiamciting
the following examples; Mathias
Ashipembe, David Sheehama,
Fillemon Elifas, Joseph Dumeni and
many others. These are merely some
examples of atrocities committed by
South Africa against the people of
Namibia, and for which Swapo gets the
blame.

Many Namibians do not have homes
or property any more, as these have
been destroyed by the racist’s Casspirs.
Swapo has never committed any such
actagainst the people of this country,
which we cannot say about South
Africa. Racist South Africa is to be
blamed for numerous atrocities
against Namibians, and I call upon the
international community to quickly
intervene. We, the people of Namibia
will continue to call for your
withdrawal from our beloved land.
even if you rape, imprison, maim, kill
and destroy our property. We call upon
you, racist South Africa, to uncondi-
tionally withdraw your forces from
Namibia and to allow the implemen-
tation of UN Resolution 435, so that

peace and justice may come to our

AS LONG as I live, I remain flab-
bergasted by the gravity of audacity,
courage and perseverance some people
are endowed with. These are the words
which slip into my mind whenever |
stop to muse over the kind of personaili-
ty of our Bishop Kleopas Dumeni of
ELCIN.

To me the Bishop orchestrates a
typical leader, who, given a chance
wasted by fortune-seekers and
hypocritical politicians in thiscountry,
will or can lead Namibia into blossom-
ing tomorrows.

The Bishop's charisma goes beyond
spiritual confines. It isto me always a
blessing to listen to his sermons and
how I wish, always, he could be allot-
ted the Presidency.

The Bishop displayed metaphysical
courage and boldness at the recent
mass funeral of victimsof the Oshakati
bank bomb massacre. In the face of a
gruesome and satanic horror which
struck numb the people of the north,
where innocent young lives, including
that of his own daughter, were put to
waste, he said his say and he said it
right and in a calm and unshaken
voice.

One really wonders atthe charisma
this man of God haa, for, even if death
struck his family a cataclyamic blow,
almost thrice in a row, he goes forth to
console his parishioners, when he

IS IT possible to talk about church and
politics at the same time? Do the two
have anything in common? Can the
church mix with politica? Such ques-
tions and more similar questions are
struggled with in the context of
Namibia in particular. Such questions
are both theological and political. For-
tunately, theological and political
questions are asked by human beings
who are involved either in the church
and/or politics in one way or another.

My aim here is to open up a
theolagical and political debate for
concerned people in a situation of apar-
theid, colonialism, racism, exploita-
tion and draconian lawssuch as those
of Namibia. I am stating only
preliminary remarks, sparing the rest
for contemplated responses.

The truth of the matter is that the
Church cannot claim its existence
without people Likewise politics can.
not be without people. It is the people
whoconstitute the church. it is the peo-
ple who politicise. The basic concern of
the church is wider and broader than
ity numerical membership. It is within
the framework of the Church's pro-
pheticcall and public responsibility to
aspire for peace, justice, freedom,
respect of human rights and dignity to
all people irrespective of their stations
in life. On the other hand, the Church
is not serving angels, but human be-
ings whose basic needs - among others
- include food, shelter, clothing and
security or safety. In essence, these |

needs cannot be secured without some"

ALLOW me toair my opinion that we
the Namibians, are guilty of colonising
ourselves, especially in the far north
of Namibia.

Students who pass matric with good
symbols are unable to find jobs. Often
only those from rich families are con-
sidered, while those from poor families
are turned down. Employers
sometimes only give jobs to those well-
known names from rich families.

It happens in the hospitals as well.
On many occasions only those who are
well known inthe hospital circles can
be immediately hospitalised ifthey are
ill or sick, while many poor people
stand for a long time before they get
treated.

I wishtocall for anendtothis sort of
discrimination. Namibians should do

ment equality among themselves in
order to achieve peace. Stop this man-
ner of colonising your own people.

I READ in the people's newspaper (The

had been allegedly planning to
assassinate Mr Peter Kalangula.

This action is being rejected by all

that PLAN hasnothing todo withthe

The proof lies in the words of Mr

The people think that the person the

South Africa's own instrument.

From my point of view this was an at-
tempt to cause hatred among the peo-
ple. South Africa is always trying to
divide us in order to facilitate their il-
legal rule over Namibia.

I feel this action was intended to
smear the name of Swapo and at the

Kalangula who calls for the
withdrawal of the South African

WE note the letter from Professor A
Heywood, published in your
newspaper on May 20, 1988, in which
she differs with certain statements
made in an advertisement which was
placed by NPP 435 in the Windhoek
Observer. We would like to respond to
the three major points which she has
raised in her letter:
1) On the question of whether or not
Resolution 435 provides for elections
under joint South African and United
Nations (UN) supervision: Prof
Heywood is quite correct in stating
that ‘‘Resolution 435 and the
documents surrounding it are reflec-
tions of historical reality”. Your cor-
respondent correctly points out that
Resolution 385 (which preceded
Resolution 435 by tlwo-and-a-half
years) declares that free elections be
held under supervision and control of
the UN. However, in order to give effect
to Resolution 385, the Western Five
negotiated a settlement plan for
Namibia with South Africa and
Swapo, which culminated in the
Western Proposal for Settlement
(Security Council Document 5/126386).

This Western proposal was
thereafter ratified by the United Na-
tions Security Council (UNSC) in its
Resolution 435 (1978) and as such
forms part of the resolution.

In Resolution 431 of July 27, 1978,
the Security Council took note of the
Western Proposals, and requested the
Secretary-General to submit a report
containing his recommendations tor
the implementation of the Western
Proposals. Thus the Western Proposals
were accepted by the UNSC in Resolu-
tion 431. In Security Council Docu-
ment S/12827 of August 29, 1978, the
Secretary-General made recommen-

_ dations, as requested in Res 431; later,
in an Explanatory Statement
(8/12869) of September 28, 1978, he ad-
dressed and explained certain con-
cerns raised during consultations with
all the parties involyed. Both of these
documents were approved in Res 435
of September 29, 1978, and the
Western Proposals were approved and
ratified as such by Res 435 (1978).

It is clear from the Western Pro-
posals, although not explicitly stated,
that in effect the elections will be held"

Costs of 435

WHAT many Namibians have warned
against for many years has now come
to pass. As soon as the South African
Government tells us of ‘agreement’
with regard toimplementation of 435,
we are informed that it will cost
billionsandthe UN must now look for
the money.

For years, all UN resolutions aimed
at preserving the natural wealth of our
country, have been ignored by South
Africa and all those nations exploiting
our natural resources. South African
occupation of Namibia costs millions
aday but no money is available for the
implementation of the peace plan.
Salaries of South Africa’s proxies in
Namibia have been increased time and
again and for that, money was

available. And in all this, Namibians
had no say, they only paid taxes.

While we are not overexcited at thie
point that the agenda for implementa-
tion will follow the time schedule that
was indicated by the SA Foreign
Minuater, the time has come for Nam.

regard to who will foot the bill Surely

ponder

Namibia still has some resources
therefore we propose that an indepen.
dent commission be established im
mediately with complete insight into
all transactions involving monies leav-
ing this country, with immediate
effect,
_ that all export of Namibian natural
resources be monitored by the UN and
all resources accruing therefore, be put
in a fund towards paying for
implementation;
= that with immediate effect, all
monies collected through sales tax be
paid into the abovementioned fund;
C that the exhorbitant salaries paid
to SA proxies in Namibia be im-
mediately stopped and that money be

pat in the abovementioned

should receive salaries from the ool-

cording to the Thirion Report, have
been sending out natural resources il-
legally, or have paid leas taxes than
they should have, be compelled to pay
the said amounts in the implementa.
tion fund;
J that all taxes paid by Namibiansin
order to fund second tier authorities,
be channelled into the said fund.

Since the people of this country have
never hed a say in whathappenstothe
funds collected through the means
above, they should do eo now. The six
points mentioned above are only
pointers. We realise there should be

that all those parties which have been

My dear Namibiana, do you know

water to drink and for domestic pur-

our houses; sufficient clothing to keep
us warm and enable us to conform with
accepted standards of decency; fire or
fuel to enable us to cook our food: and
a shelter to protect us from the sun,
wind and rain

If the Namibian nation is deprived
of these needs by a certain greedy
group of people, that greedy grouperrs
against God's will and against the

ALLOW me tocomment on the letter
which appeared in The Namibian of
August 05, under the heading
“Pallacious’ written by V T Kavari.

I've been present al the Nanso con:
yrcsses since 1986¢ second congress) up
to this year with the fourth congress.
where I've experienced a spirit of
brotherhood.

What I have observed is that after &
speaker has delivered a speech, oppor:
tunity was given to the house for
discussion, questions, correction, ad.
dition, clarification, comment, etc.

I believe this was done so that with
the departure of the congress no com:
rades could go to their respective
places with unsolved problems as it ap
pears to be in your case.

I'm just wondering whether you
never got the opportunity to air your
viewsand to gopersonally tothe NEC
Members, instead of doing it in the
newspapers and to create a tasteless
spirit among the students, which 1s
totally unnecessaFy.

If you were at the congress you will
remember that comrade Shihwamen!
was the last person to clarify on this
issue. |

He explained that people have to
make the difference between 4 pro
gressive parly and a liberation move-
ment. He went on saying that pro-
gressive parties are mostly concerned
with ethnic issues, while Swapo which
‘sa liberation movement, is aimed at
liberating all the peace loving people
in Namibia irrespective of their col-
ours, ethnic groups, etc.

This is a fact that we, in Namibia
have to accept that Swapo is the only,
only armed movement that isfighting
(uniess, a8 Shinwameni said, “there is
another armed movement that 1s
hiding underground’)

Whatcomrade Steve saidat the con-
gress on this issue was positive and I,
with the majority accepted it, although
you differed as you said, in your letter.
Of course, minorities always differ!
That we have learned from history in
this country.

Lastly, let the truth not hurt ua,

The honourable Administrator
General is adding to the confusion by
repeating issues that were long since
dealt with. Are his pronouncements
aimed at shipwrecking the present
negotiations, or are they an indication
of South Africa’s unwilling participa-

The question of the socalled ‘UN par:
tiality’ was addressed to the satisfac.
tion of the SA Government from 1978
to 1982. South Africa wae satisfied to
such an extent that at one point the SA
Minister of Foreign Affairs went on
record saying the “Cuban issue’ was
the only obstacle to the implementa.
tion of Resolution 435.

It is however, important to state that
itis not only the UN that must be im.
partial, The same impartiality 18 ex:
pected from the office of the Ad.
ministrator General. Both the Special
Representative ofthe UN's Secretary
General and the SA representative -1n

RE is another sfde tothe story of J
the socalled “Ten years of peace in East
Caprivi’ (The Windhoek Advertiser,
August 26). It has not had ten years of
peace as Brigadier Gert Nel suggests:
it HAS been ten years of humiliation
and intimidation.

Iregard this report as an attempt to
invalidate the very successful Swapo
rally held in the region on August 20,

as wellastodiscredit Capriviansin the
eyes of fellow Namibians. Brigadier
Nel’s tong report on the socalled ‘peace’
is mere propaganda.

Leaders have been intimidated and
harassed by the SADF and its counter-
part, Swapol, formerly SAP. The socall-
ed ‘leaders’, as claimed by Brigadier
Nel, are instruments used to further
the prevailing status quo. The tradi-
tional leaders are merely the
equivalents of the Katjiuonguas and
Matyplas of Namibia.

As regards what Brigadier Nel calls
‘cooperation’ between the army and
civilians, I have the following to say:

* intense psychological war is at work
in the region; 7

* the people do not admire the SADF
or SWATF, because it is not their army,
but South Africa's, The civilians may
‘cooperate with the army because they
need to survive; but itis not out of their
own will. Their fear is legitimate.

The bitter irony behind the creation
of 701 Battalion is that most young
men have joined the army as a last
resort. The rate of unemployment in
Caprivi is so high that people are left [
with two major options: to join the ar-
my, undesirable as that is, or become
a teacher. |

The SADF and Swapol have repress-
ed any sign of protest so that may give
an illusion of ‘peace’ in the region.

Regarding Enok/FNDC, this com-
pany may be credited with
monopolistic and exploitative prac-
tices in the region. It is notorious for
paying low wages, and they are cer-
tainly not contributing to any develop-
ment worth mentioning

The SWABC is nothing other thana
mouthpiece of the interim government
and ita masters in Pretoria: It is also
used to disseminate the kind of pro-
paganda which Brigadier Nel

WE FACE an enemy that is deep-

within and beyond our borders the pro-

spects of victory grows bright.
The first condition for victory 1s
black unity. Every effort to divide

blacks must be vigorously repulsed.
Our people must be united into a
single, massive and solid wall of
resistance of united mass action. This
isnot the time for the luxury of disun)-

differences must be submerged to the
achievement ofa single goal which is
the complete overthrow of apartheid
and racist domination.

The revulsion of the world against
apartheid is growing.. The world ison

pressure on the racist and colonial
rulers of our country. Every effort to
isolate South Africa adds strength to

“The student movement still temains

united as before. Whathappened at the
congress was mere recognition and
acknowledgement of the reality that
Swapo is the leader of the liberation
movement, let alone being the only
liberation movement. Kavari, in fact
should show cause why Nanso must
not acknowledge Swapo leadership of
the national liberation struggle. I feel
strongly thattoaccept the unavoidable
reality that Swapo leads the nation
liberation struggle does not make us
politically affiliated to Swapo.

What is surprising for Kavari's let-
ter and all others who seem to be con-
cerned with Nanso’s socalled pro-
Swapo stand, isthat noneofthem men-
tioned the current crisis in education.
An impression is given that Nanso’s
recognition that Swapo leads the
liberation struggle is more evil and
criminal than the current crisis in
education. Meetings after meetings
are called and proposed not to address
the crisis, but Nanso. Nanso now has
become the crisis. Kavari talks of
another national student movement
as a possibility, simply because Nan-
so has recognized Swapo leadership of
our struggle. IfNanso had recognized
or named the HNP as a progressive
party, than one would understand and
conceptualize the cry of Kavari et al.
If Nanso had failed to address the cur-
rent crisis properly and Kavari et al
talk of another student movement
which shall address the crisis in a bet-
ter way, one would understand their
cry. But thecry issimply because Nan-
so says Swapo leads our nation at war
with SA colonizers. Swapo, the pro-
greasive movement, the organizer of
victories of our people in their heroic
anti-colonial and anti-imperialist
struggle, has suddenly become the
crisis now in which energies must be
expended. The colonizera are now

attention should be given tosssisting

ing against the regime.
According tothe current talks
South Africa and America introdaced
new issues in the matter and are try-
ing their best to switch the burden of
talks to the opposite parties - will
Angola accept all the SA. and
American demands? If yes, what will
happen to Angola next?
We rejected the connection of Cubans
to the independence of Namibia and

wore and are still demanding the

withdrawal of the S.A. troops and ita il-
legal regime from Namibia, but not
one of either parties (South Africa or
America) is willing to listen to us as
they are in favour of war. South Africa
staysin Walvis Bay even after UNSCR
435 is implemented - what then?

We are intimidated by the SA.
regime with its apartheid laws and
military atrocities. It is preaching its
“goodness” to win the hearts and
minds of the people, but we suffered for
a long time under its colonial regime.
It is still continuing to minimize our
political rights - how will we continue
with talks?

Cubans were willing to help Angola
from the intimidation we expenencing
here and their presence in Angola is
legal. As long as the intimidation to
the Namibian people continues
Angola cannot be saved.

Those who are threatened by the
presence of Cubans in Angola are the
“Terreblanche group’ of the South
African regime, who want to exploit
the Angolan people and its allies. Once
the Cubans withdraw from Angola the
‘“Terreblanche speech” in the past few
days will be manifested practically.

The Namibian people welcome the
Cubans, because they are comrades -
they don't kill, but save. We have ex-
perienced SA (not Cuban) atrocities;
and the Angolans too.

No to homelands

THE tnbalists who are trying to
divide this country into homelands
must be made to remember that our
nation cannot tolerate such divisions
in Namibia. The land is one, and the

e are one. Our nation must stand
firm in unity to fight against all forms
of divisions and homclands in the

country. Things like the socalled
Republic of Rehoboth and Caprivi
cannot be tolerated in the would-be
independent Namibia.

_ Those who are involved in organi-
sing such things must repentand give
up such reactionary ideas immedi-
ately. This country is one, from the
Angolan border to the Orange River,
and from the Zambian border to the
Aduantic Ocean.

We find it disturbing that we still
have brainwashed Afncan (Namib-
ian) intellectuals who believe in
homelands and tibalism when we
have our heroes who have died for
the freedom of Namibia as a whole.
] just wonder from which books these
people have gathered such mislcad-
ing information.

These people should know that itis
utterly irresponsible and a marked
betrayal of those who died fighting
for the independence of Namibia as
well as the masses in this county.
Those people should also know that
their actions are a sign of mental
subjugation, and what J would call
the disease, requires an antidote.
Luckily, unlike Aids, an anudote is
available. People involved in declar-
ing homelands in Namibia must take
the undistorted history books and
read. perhaps this will make they
realise that they owe apologies to
faithful Namibians.

I appeal to our brothers and sisters
in Rehoboth and C aprivi not to sup-
port the people trying to lead them
into total nco-colonialism. All Na-
mibians must have the freedom to
live where they want to; and not be
confined to certain regions.

Swapo has been fighting to rid use
of the colonial yoke of South Africa
and the movement accepts all patri-
otic Namibians who want to be free.
Swapo condemns tnbalism, region-
alism, sexism, racism and above all,
colonialism. The people of Namibia
should be vigilant because the pup-
pets trying lo umpose homelands upon
them are creating civil war condi-
tions so that there is no peace ina free

~ sponsible activities of the supec-
powers, mainly the United States.

First of all they linked the
Namibian peace process to the
withdrawal of Cuban woops from
Angola; now they want to link the
number of Untag troops and offi-
cials with the negotiations. The

state that the Americans are the
ones who have the money; they
are the ones who have to pay for
the implementation of Resolu-
tion 435.

Now the US have another cx-
cuse: they say that they can only
afford R100 million or the equiva-
lent in Dollars. This means that
the Untag component has to be
reduced. If they have to pay the
full amount (for Untag) then they
will demand that the Angolan
Governmem negotiate with Units.

war. They are the ones continu-

They are the ones who declared
the ANC a terrorist movement;
they are the ones which attacked
the MiG 23’s of Libya; they are
the ones who don’t want the Pal-
estinians to negotiate with the
Israclis.

If they want to reduce the number
of Untag troops, then they must

change Resolution 435, because: —

Resolution 435 says that 7500
Untag troops will arrive in’ Na-
mibia to supervise the elections;
Resolution 435 does not stipulate
that the Angolan Government must
negotiate with Unita; and in Reso-
lution 435 there is no such thing
that Untag troops must be com-
bined with the Koevoet or the

If they wantto contradict Reso-

‘A sensitive nerve

Indeed Mr Shipanga's ‘New Year's
Message’ touched a sensitive nerve
in me, especially with the untruths
and political dishonesty that ‘mes-
sage’ displayed.

In his article (27/01/89) Mr Shipanga
implies that because Father Wolfe
had said that ‘‘reconciliation of the
Namibian people as a whole is needed
before we can become one Namibia
one Nation’’, then anybody who uses
the word ‘reconciliation’ on televi-
sion must go unchecked. Mr Shipanga,
reconciliation is not merely an event
- it is a process in which not only
what we say, but also what we do,
will determine the essence of our
determination.
~ So do not think that people will
believe your sincenty because you
use the words ‘peace’ and ‘reconcili-
ation’, even more so when your frame
of reference is artificial: (that your

Reply to Shipanga

THIS letter follows one by Mr
Vezera Kandetu (The Namibian
Jamuary 14 1989) and to the reply by
Mr Andreas Shipanga. I was going to
stat my mouth al this ume, and merely
hope that the future would bring me
and fellow Namibians the best.

When Shipanga joined the TGNU
he knew very well that they would be
tesponsible to the Government of
South Africa, and he chose to fight
for freedom, liberty and self-deter-
mination with the South African
Government, with Botha ‘leading the
revolution’ and the Administrator
General es the man in charge of the
socalled ‘defenders’ of the nghts of
Nanubians.

What does Shipanga mean when
he says ‘It is just this sort of hubns
which has hampered the struggle for
truc liberation in Namibia forsolong
and encouraged the armchair revolu-
lionaries to waste their words and
deeds on irtelevancies’.

To tell the truth, Shipanga is one of
those who hampered the struggle for
true Liberation if he remembers what
he did in 1978: he divided the froe-
doen fighters. And the description in
question fis him very well. Lei me
say, he has been an annchair revolu-

tionary who hes been wasting his
words and deeds, by way of
tb Namiblen people along nie
Eeeets, Th potio of he and his

colleagues made the South African
Government realise that they could
not enforce its rule through Namib-
ian intermediaries, and so they went
to the negotiating table.

The TGNU never had the power to
decide, and the South Afncan Gov-
emment got what it wanted from the
interim government.

Swapo would like united people as
itis their mMouo to unite the Namibian
people. But how can it succeed in
uniting the people if there are those
hike yourself who are always divid-
ing the nation. Swapo will unite and
join hands with fellow Namibians in
order to build up the nation you dis-
appointed, and the beloved land you
betrayed.

On the question of your call on
Swapo to release the detainces it is
holding, that is none of your busi-
ness. After all, some of these things
are already provided for in accor-
dance with UNSCR 435 (1978) and
629 (1989), and all dates and events
are based upon the Annex to the
settlement Proposal S/12636 of Apni
10 1978, just in case the South Afri-
can Government hasn't bnefed you.

Why didn’t the intenm govern-
ment repeal laws such as AG 26:
many Namibians have been detained
without trial, and the interim govern-
ment did not question this.

camps; and it was you who started

ngNU2J788OUVyOERaNG52WUSRPGCdVaKCOVxyRUR,"Upset with Untag

I WISH to express my heartfelt
sadness at the irresponsible attitude
of Untag in Namibia from April 1.

I am disappointed in Untag in
general and Mr Martti Ahtisaari, for
their unwillingness to perform their
duties as expected of them by the
Namibian people.

On April 1, a peaceful march of
the Namibian workers under leader-
ship of NUNW was forcefully stopped
by colonial, heavily armed police in
the absence of Untag police who are

Supposed to accompany them. Thanks
lo the disciplined actions of the
workers themselves, injuries and
bloodshed was avoided since the
colonial police were under strict
command to act against the 15 0(XK)-
strong crowd if they proceeded with
the march to hand over a petition
protesting privatisation of public
property to Mr Louis Pienaar, the
Administrator General.

After the well-attended Swapo rally
in Windhock on April 1, Swapo
ricmbers and supporters on their
way back north were shot al by two
white vigilantes. Seven people were
Injured, two senously. When a local
pastor went to report the incident to
Untag personnel in Tsumeb, he found
the officer in an inebnated.

The most buming issue, which
forced me to write this Ictter, was
when civilians when to Untag per-
sonnel in Oshakati to repon heavy
fighting between Plan and the colo-
nial army, the two Malaysian mem-
bers of Untag took no notice and
went on rcading their novels. Some
of them were seen SIPping wine with
South Afncan soldiers at Ondangue
and Oshakau. |] am wondering whether
Uiese intemational peacemakers are
really serious about what they are
doing in Namibia. I am also sur.

_ prised that certain countries agree to
— contribute soldiers when they want
assurances of their safety.

} would also like toexpress myself

— on the decision by Mr Ahtisaari to
allow the notorious 10) and 202
battalions to be reactivated in order
to fight Swapo. Mr Ahtisuani's mis.
s10n Was to make peace but instead
he ugreed to the demands of the co-
lonial govemmor to allow the same
Broupa to go ahead and continue
doing what they have done for YCars,

Mr Ahtisaan, through his actions,
has lost the respect and sopularity he
has enjoyed since 1074

I call upon all progressive farces
Inside Namibia ww take united and
dechiive action. We should always
remember the inspiring words of
Swapo Prosident, Sam Nujoma, who
sald ‘‘we the Namibians, aro ow

On Ahtisaar!

PLEASE allow meto air my views
rogarding the position of Mr Martti
Ahtisaari in the current situation in
our country:

Sir, we are very perplexed by your
attitude tow ards our people under the
leadership of Swapo.

It is amazing that, as UN Special
Representative, who has come to
Namibia to make sure that the inter-
national procedures leading to inde-
pendence, are carried out with jus-
tice and without partiality to any
party, you have given the order to the
troops of South Africa to hunt down
forces who in fact were in the country
prior to the ceasefire.

This, to us who are yearning for
our freedom, clearly demonstrates
that you have taken apanial decision ‘|’
in favour of our colonisers. [tis a pity
that instead of bringing abwut peace,
you are encouraging the forces of the
racist’ government to eliminate
Namibians.

Swapo 1s a well-disciplincd move-
ment and would not defy the guide-
lines and regulations set up and agreed
to conceming our transition to inde-
pendence.

Insteac of deploying Untag
peacekeeping forces to the area of
conflict to separate the warring sides,
you decided in favour of the one side.
Swapo forces then had no alternative
but to defend themselves against those
who started hunting down our com-
batants.

Sir, if justice were to be done, you
would have acted impartially to
solvethe conflict. The Government
in Pretoria may have planned these
acts of violation in advance, to jeopar-
dise the peace process. They knew
long ago that anumber of Plan forces
were based inside Namibia. They
attacked our fighters on the day
implementation of the peace plan
started, and them put the blame on
our forces as the violators of the
peace process.

Then most of the world, including
Margaret Thatcher, started blaming
Swapo; they have most of the media
at their disposal. How can you decide
to assist the racist forces to expel

‘these bona fide sons of Namibia from
their own country? Angola is not

Gave their lives

AS ONE of the greatest fans of
your newspaper, allow me to air my
views conceming the recent clash
between Swapo combatants and South
Afncan security forces.

First of all, I take my hat off to
those freedom fighters who gave their
lives for us to be free. (Not only
them, but for South African security
forces who didn’t know what they
were doing, may God forgive them).
When I think of those who died, my
blood mins cold. Freedom was so
near and yet so far for them.

Secondly, the members of the UN
who were in favour of the reduction
of Untag from 7500 t0 4650, should
now bow their heads in shame. What
&@ great mistake it was.

According to eyewitnesses, the
security forces fired against the
combatants first. AndI believe them.
One may ask why? Because I cannot
believe someone, who, for 70 years,
has made me a subject of the evil
system called apertheid.
pepe pre Swapo. Why?

blamed because
fought beck in self-defence? Orie
because the US end its allics call

Swapo a ‘terrorist’ organisation?
Swapo is a liberation movement and
we are proud of it. According to
international law and the UN Char-
ter, we have the right to resist South
Afican occupation.

The Untag forces were supposed
to secure peace. Where were they?
The Botha’s are making fools of them.
The UN is now experiencing what we
have experienced for many years.

The Swapo combatants were re-
grouping to be confined to bases
when the security forces fired on
them. Who gave that instruction?
Botha or Ahtisaari?

Last but not least: Untag gives the
green light to South Africa to re-
deploy Koevoet and 101 Battalion to
assist them in their peacekeeping task.
Will a child's heart ever forget who
killed his mother? Will amother ever
forget who raped her ten-year-old
daughter? Some may forgive, but
they will never forget.

We will continue to resist our
occupation: Europe tasted Nazi oc-
cupation and opposed it. We have the
right to do the same.

Mudge and Kaura

. THEDTA Chairman Dirk Mudge,
saust clean his pwn house before he
| -ooks at those of others. We see DTA

- for reconciliation. We notice that the
DTA has chosen to fight against Swapo
rather than South Africa, which has
occupied the country formany years.

Mudge has also been making ac-
cusations about atrocities in Swapo
settlements, something he has no
evidence of. Yet he and his sapport-
ets appear to have Koevoet at their
disposal, who are the culprits as far
as atrocities in Namibia are con-
cerned. Mudge and Kaura are not
happy to see a Namibian nation
marching to freedom. They appear to
be perpetrating tribalism and divi-
sion among the people of this coun-

A few weeks ago K aura was inter-
viewed on the BBC where he claimed
that Swapo leaders were provoking
his supporters and he warned about
‘fights’ which may erupt in Katu-
tura. He also wamed Swapo leaders
that their safety may be jeopardised
if such ‘fights’ break out.

The anti-Swapo propaganda being
carried out by the DTA is the reverse
of the wuth. We have evidence that
the DTA is doing the very things they
accuse Swapo of.

Dirk Mudge and Kaura must real-
ise that in Swapo, they are dealing
with amovement whichis politically
mature. Swapo is not interested in
bringing Namibians into conflict or
the county into neo-colonialism, as
the DTA is doing.

Mudge and Kaura must control
their supporters not to provoke peace-
ful Swapo supporters any longer.
Swapo supporters do not interfere
with the affairs of other groups. Let
us campaign peacefully for the elec-
tions without intimidating anyone.
Mudge and Kaura must know what
the consequences of civil war is - that
is, if they have ready history. We in
Namibia do not want such a situation
here. Our people have suffered for
too long and they need peace and
freedom, which Swapo has and still
stands for.

public. On April 30, security forces
came out of bases and intimidated
people, tearing down NUNW plac-
ards. Letting the SADF from con-
finement doesn't give peace a chance.

3. Residents are compelled to put

What about democracy?

4. Residents here are threatened if
they demonstrate the black power

5. We need more Untag offices in
the north to facilitate contact by ci-

could be made easier.

6. Untag lacks contact with resi-
dents - they should talk freely to

1. It looks as if Mr Ahtisaari can-

1.1 After the security force at-

he allowed the South African ermy to
leave their bases for a large attack on
SWAPO fighters.

1.2 After the confinement of the
South African troops to their bases
for 60 hours, we find they had al-
ready left the bases before the des-
ignated 06h00 on April 29. They
started to fire allert shots during the
whole night of the 28th. The UNTAG
forces in the north will agree with
me. From 02h00 on the moming of
the 29th their Casspirs and Rattels
were on the road.

Why do they have to monitor the
withdrawal of the SWAPO fighters?
Will SWAPO fighters do the same
when they withdraw? What is the
UNTAG force doing here?

2.So many Koevocypolice are
deployed and moving around m
Northern Namibia in their Casspirs
amongst the people. Why don’t they
stay at their police stations? Is it
because because there is no room for
all of them? The whoke KOEVOET

keep such a big police force? Is is just
to distribute DTA pamflets, helping
in their campaign as they did on
April 29 at Othingo, on the west of
Oshakati and elsewhere?

THE tong yearned-for Namibian
after more than 70
years of South African rule, is clearly
visible. But prospects toward a lJast-
ing peace m a future independent
Namibia, and the entire region of
southern Africa, is still miles away.
There are two major areas of concem
- the status of Walvis Bay and the
Angolan war.

Walvis Bay, Namibia's only deep
ocean-gomg port, poses a single major
threat to any post-independent gov-
emment in Namibia as long as South
Afnca continues its claim over the
port. Despite the United Nations rul-
ing that Walvis Bay is an intcgral
part of Namibia, Pretona continues
to regard and treat the nortas part and
parcel of South Afric}.

Walvis Bay is not only a vital
anchorage for imports and exports,
but provides a large military basc
and airstnp for South Afnca to con-
tinue its destabilising tactics against
the neighbounng black African states.
This will enable South Africatokcep
war away from its mainland. No
county has so far dared to launch a
direct attack on the South African
mainland while South Africa has used
illegally occupied Namubia as a spring-
board for its periodic incursions into
southem Angola.

Walvis Bay has even greater im-
plications in terms of its relationship
to a fubure independent Namibia. Since
the port is part of South Afnica, those
Namubians residing in Swakopmund
and elsewhere will need to have visas
to leave and enter the port. And a
horde of Walvis Bay residents em-
ployed at the Rossing Uranium Lid,
outside Swakopmund, will have to
periodically renew their visas to en-
ter and leave the port on their way to
and from work.

Also, the SA officials travelling by
road to Walvis will need to apply for
visas to leave and enter Namibian
territory. Walvis Bay also stands as a
potential cover for any opponents of
a new Namibian government, and
might as well provide for their base.

And the fact that Pretoria and its

the second I have willingly chosen as
a partner for life. Perhaps my letter
should be viewed in a similar, if not
the same, light.

It makes me sad when | see how
many born Namibians do not use
their education and knowledge to
help their own country and work for
the benefit of their own people. This
makes things worse for those who
prefer to work for enemics of the
peaceful implementation of Resolu-
uon 435.

I believe every responsible resi-
dent of this country should take the
Ongoing process very senously and
uy their best to make it succeed.

This is an histoncal event, which
our children and future genesations
are going to learn about in the class-
rooms.

There are many powerful forces in
Namibia working to see the process
fail and war and suffering start again.
They are the forces which, in the
past, were never in favour of inde-
pendence, and were planning some
sort of independence of their own
without internauonal recognition.

The South Afncan Government
was never serious about 435 and its
posiuon is sull unchanged. South
Afnica really intended to reduce the
high cost of the Angolan war and
switch it to Namibia, which is much
cheaper. This is only possible with
its faithful puppets which have long
experience in doing ‘dirty work’.

We know, and Pretoria knows even
better, that it is impossible to hold a
free and fair clection here when
Koevoet has poopie at gunpoint. 11

Atraid of liars

IN Oshiwambo there is a proverb
which says: Omufundji oku vule
omulodhi. It means a har is worse
than a witch. The saying continues: It
is better to accomodate a witch than
a lier.

Lhave been baling to understand
the proverb of my ancestors. My
question has been, why did they look
upon liars with apprehension? (1 pould
be happy if someone could give fur-
ther clarification).

For many years we have been oul-
side our beloved motherland - parted
from our parents, sisters, brothers,
friends and comrades. We havc al-
ways becn dreaming of home.

It also pasned us when we were
told that some of our relatives or
fnends penshed in the bloody 23.
year war. Therefore, we understand
what it meant when some of our
fellow compatnots were told that
their nextof kin were ‘eliminated’ by
Swapo. These lics have caused
immense damage and confusion.

Maybe our ancestors were afraid
of liars because what they said did
not only affect a limited number of
people, but the entre population. A
witch destroys only one or two poople,
and then that is the end.

When liars speaks of death, they
mean life; when they speak of de:
mocracy, they mean tyranny, justice
= injusucc, reconstruction = destruc-
tion, freedom = oppression or captiv-
ity, decolonisation = colonisation,
freedom from South Afnca = de-
pendence on South Afnca.

These are the people who nearly
destroyed the Namibia peace process
by concocting lies that Swapo com-
batanis infiltrated Namibia on Apni
1, while many of them had been in-
side already.

Lies were fabricated again when it
was reported that Swapo combatants
were moving south of the sixicenth

into Namibia - an absurd statement
indeed.

For the past few weeks since the
election campaign went into top gear,
the DTA has embarked upon some un-
orthodox ways in its hopeless bid to try
and win potential voters in Katutura.
Every morning at 0S5h00 I have been
waking to a bizarre sound from the
DTA Nissan minibus which roams the
streets of Katutura endlessly.

This not only reflects the way in
which the DTA regards the people of
Katutura with contempt, ic. through
disturbing their rest and peace: but also
their inherent racist ideology. They
don’t go around like this in ‘white’
Windhoek. Because for them, those
people or residents need their rest
dearly, while the residents of Katutura
epparently don't.

This, I am sure many would agree,
does amount 10 psychological intimi-

DTA and 435

ALLOW me to be an ethnicist at this
moment by introducing myself as a
Caprivian amd a proud ‘Mafwe' for that
taattez. | wish to cxpress concern about
my fellow ‘Mafwes’ who are support-
ocs of the DTA. I am prood, and do not
heaitate to mention thet the Mafwe are
people with « definite culture who
strive for good mora! norms aad codes.
Theeefor what the DTA is doing is not

took place ot Mekangs, Sinywebuna,

respected Mafwe tribal authority toler-
ates such actons | wonder
whether the Tealises the reper-
cussions for itself.

However, let me sound a warning to
fellow Namibians, particularly the
DTAs. Just as God liberated the Leraelis
from the bondage of slavery to the
Egyptians, God is now going to liberate
His sons, the Namibians, from the yoke
of bondage from SA colonial rule.
Never mind how stubbom Pharaoh
was, the fact remains thai the Israelites
were liberated from Egypt as God de-
cided. Never mind how stubbom the
South Afncans/DTA may be, the fact
remains Namibia will be free.

I have a strong conviction that any-
one who stands in the way of God will
be drowned in the Red Sea This isa
good warning to the DTA.

Mr Martti Abtisasri and his team
represent Moses in the peace process:
“History repeats itself’.

Fellow Namibians and fellow Ca-
privians, fellow Mafwes and the DTA:
““T kanda ka i li twikiwe’': thas is, you
Cannot put the country on your bead. It
is beavy and will break your neck.

We know the DTA was totally
against the implementation of Resolu-
bon 435. We call on this organisation
ot to involve itself in the peace proc-
ess with a manner of pretence, aiming
to disrupt and cause the process to fail.
It must not come owt with dirty ticks
and strategies of using the sadicals of
the community and school dropouts to
prevent the process from being run in
the letter and spirit of 435.

Itis a good sign of ignorance to see a

aging them and the pupils present to

when it comes to power?

On the other hand people are ques-

has been directly involved in the proc-
css that has brought Namibia to the
present political situation, it knows and
understands what is happening and
where it is heading, and it

work with both good and bad elements.
A parent socepts all its children. So let
us all come together under Swapo; jet
us avoid fighting ome another, let us
know who the real enemy is.

Finally I want to call on the Mafwe to
sec to it that poople are disciplined and
that they respect and love one another.

Botha’s threat

I PERCEIVED with dismay the
threatening statement made by South
African Foreign Affairs Minister,
Roelof Botha, on his recent visit to
Windhoek to the effect that “if any-
thing unforeseen happens between
now and Namibian independence,
which violates any of the agreed
principles his government reserved
the right to take whaicver stcps it

doomed necessury’’.

1 would like to remind the colonisers
that we did not invite South Africa to
invade our beloved Namibia and
subject it to colonialism and all that
gocs with it, and their presence here
has aiways been illegal, nor did we
consent to the German fascism of
von Trotha.

We fought back tooth and nail
against these forces unul today when
the deeply yeamed-for freedom and
independence 1s about to be born.

We know South Afnca is not
committed to genuine implementa-
tion of 435, and if it was not for the
heavy burden of war, which the oc-
cupier could not sustain, then the
future of this country would stil] be
locked in chains.

If any ‘unforeseen’ happens in this
country, as Mr Botha fears, then it
wil undoubtedly be the fault of Pre-
tora. Namibians are peace loving
people who have no intenuon of
invading other nations or neighbours.

Mr Botha should restrain his forces
and cease their clandestine activi-
tics. South Africa must not attempt
to create a pretext to invade this
country to perpetuate colonialism or
insutute neo-colomalism.

It is unacceptable for the SADF or
SAP to retum to our soil under any
circumstances.

They should be restrained and
disciplined. This nation does not want

partics in this country of alleged fail-
ure in condemning the recent killing
of three white residents of Grootfon-
tem. He further wondered why the
murders had occurred after the adop-
ton of the constitution of the Repub-
lic of Namibia.

Chief Riruako seemed to be out of
wach with events in Namibia. The
killing of irmocent people has been
common and prevalent, especially in
the north all along since the election.
Many people were robbed af gun-
point of their properties and animals
and people killed in the process.

These incidents were reported ‘in
bocal newspepers and to my know!-

@ral, who is charged with maintain-
ing law and order and different per-

lies including the Constituent As-
sembly, expressed concem and called

uncir level best to bring the culprits to
book and to end the lawless situation.

However, Chief Riruako, who wants
“peace to be maintained for all, not
for particular people or particular
Organisations’ was in this country
and never called a press conference
to denounce killings, armed robbery
etc in the north part of our country,
bui anly when they happened in Groot-
fontein. What hypocrisy on the part
of he DTA President!

In the spirit of national reconcili-
ation, the sput of Namibia demands
that we build a nation hand in hand,
irrespective of colour, race, religion
or ethnic, regional or party affili-
ations.

Lastly, Chief Riruako accused
Swapo and the AG who “‘had put
Swapo in the position of government
before Swapo had officially been

inaugurated as the new government!
It 1s not Swapo or the AG which had
pul Swapo in government. Swapo
was elected, and the AQ, as the rep-
resentative of the colonial regime,
would be the last person to put the
movement in government.

Chief Riruako must know that itis
the people of this country who hate
colonialism and sec their salvation in
Swapo that put Swapo in govern-
ment. Itis the likes of Chief Riruako
who voted for the loser party - the

DTA, who do not make any differ-

A big headache

THE opporunists among Namibians
-could cause a big headache for our future
government,

It seems to me thal most white Namibi-
ans with an opportunistic nature are those
in the ‘pnvate business sector’ and blacks
are mostly former members of SWATF,
particularly 10] Battalion.

It is sad, and at the same time logical,
that some of the 101 former soldiers are
not prepared to terve their country in a
new Namibia defence force, domanding
same of mora money than they got
tha colonial regimes.
this ls ‘Logical’ to me is because if

they were not opportunists they would
have refused to jom enemy forces in the
‘first place.

What salaries were paid to our Namib-
ian heroes, Swapo Plan combatants who
fought for so long to liberate Namibians
from the oppressive South African re-
gime, including the SWATF members?
Do they feel no shame?

If they were in Romania they would
serve life sentences or be executed by
firing squad. If they think they can get
more money elsewhere, they are free lo
look for better paid jobs.

It is their democratic nght to say no.

As far as | know Namibians there are
cnough men and women who are ready at
any lime to secure our freedom, to guard
our borders and protect our peace and
defend our democracy, filled with a spirit
of reconciliation and forgiveness, willing
to work and serve the new-borm Namibian
nation.

Eastern Capnvi. The Cinef and his

supreme ruler, custodian and para-
mount chef in the East Caprivi at the
expense of his counterpart.

Chief Moraliswam has been the

tbat we are independent, to ask the
Honourable President, as a neutral
person, tohelp resol ve the issue once
and for all so that both Chiefs respect
ome another and restore peace in the
region. The Chief ahould face reality
now. He knows very well how ex-
pensive the court case has been for
both Masubia and Mafwe factions.
People were forced to contnbute
because of his actions.

He obviously thought that by tak-
ing the case to court he would be the
victor. It is for these reasons I want
him to sit down and account for what
he has done. He has sown hatred and
mistrust instead of uniting the people,
as the role of chief should be. I see the
Chief now gives a clenched fist sa-
lute; as far as I witnessed, he was a
UDF and later an NPF supporter in
the pac.

It is my wish that the President
should solve this problem to help the
two chiefs to know their tribal juns-
dictions. Caprivi will not be the first
region to be demarcated, but chiefs
in other regions know their jurisdic-
tion and that is why there are no
senseless claims in other areas.

ends so that the one cannot claim

On forgiveness

TRY forgiving a friend who betrays
a confidence, or a co-worker who
tells lies about you. When the real
effort of forgiveness takes place, there
is nothing easy about it. Instinct urges
us to pay back in kind.
Some people are capable of heroic
effort in reconciling; others not. There
is usually a pause between the hurt
and the time when trust and love can
take root again. Forgiveness is part
of a process that begins with hurt and
ends, inits final goal, with reconcils-
ation.
It works only when we become aware
of the depths and causes of the ange!
burning in us so that we can forgive
wholeheartedly and ensure anendur-
ing peace.
Too often, we bypass forgiveness
entirely. We race from our hurt to an
arent reconciliation without tak-
ing stock of what must truly be for-
given before lasting healing can take
place. We try to get past the difficult
part too quickly,“for we have been
pro since childhood to keep
a stiff upper lip, pretend that we are
unaffected by the cruelty of others,

whether deliberate or accidental.
The ability to reconcile cannot be
Tushed. We owe if to one another to
offer time to confront our hurts, to
face our wounds head-on, to vent our
emotions. Only then can the real
healing begin.

When Jesus said ‘love your enemy’,
he meant every word of it. We never
get rid of an enemy by meeting hate
with hate; we get nd of an enemy by
getting rid of enmity.
Reconciliation depends on the situ-
alion and the people involved. In the
end, all forgivers do the same thing:
they restore self-worth to the of-
fender; they cancel a debt; they expe-
rience such peace that they lose the
urge to retaliate and live as freer
persons unshackled by the weight of
a hurt.

finding a solution for it, so that we

question of reconciliation between

sensitive issue of ALL missing, de-
tained and dead Namibians, so that
we can be truly reconciled and re-
build our nation together in peace.
I therefore applaud the unanimous

Later still, we have 10-tonne trucks

The main gate of the base was closed

way for the amy.

Then they began to use a siren for

But my dlusions af peace were
shattered when the LIN moved in,
and among others, the Kenyans in-
sisted on being physically fit and
faking the battalion for a run down
Palm Street every momung. Every
white-owned dog in the area went
bananas, as the troops ran past in
heavy boots.

But my story has not ended...

Two weeks ago, after a heavy Fn-
day mght, I fell into bed, and at
O5h00 my nightmare began. Out of
the base came the deep wail of a
bombing siren. I leapt from my bed
and jumped for my pants, images of
Kassinga and Ngiva pounding in my
head. 1 stumbled onto the lawn ex-
pecting chaos, but it was only the
troops being woken up.

Nothing has changed. The base is
still there, slap~bang in the middle of

suburbia. In the early momings, the
air-raid siren goes off.

Could T make a suggestion: that
whoever woes on duty at the base
knocks on bungalow doors to wake
up Loops, of gets the troops to wake
themselves up! Please, this is not
war-tom Angola but good old Suid-
erhof suburbia. As a homeowner near
the base, T ask those in charge to
show consideration for residents.

In the past we canvassed against
military bases in residential areas,
and while the forme: mulers were not
sympathetic, we would have thought
that our new Government would be
more considerate.

ALTHOUGH the word reconciliation
has been created with the purpose of
forgiveness, peace and unity for all
Namibian people, it remains unim-
plemented due to a lot of conflict and
provocation by former Koevoet
members against former Plan fight-
ers. The two groups fight against one
another and there is a lot of enmity
between them.

It has been observed that former
101 members provoke the freedom
renters and insult them and our lead-

p ‘tn Swapo - the very people
wh achieved independence for this
country.

The Plan cadres are already frus-
trated because of the long and bitter
war and subsequent hardship and do
not need to be provoked any more.

Therefore the new government
under Swapo leadership should make
sure that they ensure all weapons
have been collected from these for-
mer 101 members. They are particu-
larly active in Amunghambya in
Oshakati and other areas where ban-
dit and cnminal elements are lo-
cated.

Captain De Waal should be con-
tacted immediately and should state
clearly where the arms are kept or
deployed, as was reported in The
Namibian of June 1.

We do not support the idea of civil
war in Namibia, as is the case in ~
Angola and other African states.

On proper leadership

I WOULD like to comment on the |
pew organizations that have recently
been formed, namely, the TUN
(Teachers Union of Namibia) andthe |
NASEM (the Namibian Student
Education Movement).

Firstly, I would like to deal with |
the new student body. In regard to its
claims that it has been formed asa
‘‘seeutt of a leadership vacuum within |
the student community in Namibia""’ |
and, secondly, that the existing stu-
dent organizations have failed to

*‘proper leadership for
students because of their
Hoke with political parties’, I would
ttke to malice the following comments.

Eis no mirprise to me to read such

an atticle because this is the case and

THE NAMIBIAN

bean to mislead and infuse ideas of
the past colonial administrations. In
my point of view, the student! move-
ment has boon formed to foster the
interests and political ideals of their
respective political parties who are
at present on ‘death row’.

They see clearly that Nanso, which
has been a progressive student or-
ganization in the past, has won a
victorious fight against the regimo
thar illegally occupied our country, |
and which suppressed most of the
students and people of Namibia.

There was no leadership vacuum |
in Nanso. This can be proved by its
winning of the objectives it stood for.
Nanso members and supporters have
been harassed, detained and even
expelled from schools because of
their political beliefs and quest for
freedom. To say that Nanso has failed |
to serve student inferests, is mere |
bias. Nanso leadership succeeded in
mobilizing students all over the
country. It made them realize that
their interests were being suppressed
and needed to be fought for. Nanso’s
liberation standpoints, therefore, |
coincided with those of Swapo and |

|

Nantu.

Nanso could not isolate itself from
Swapo because they had common
goals to achieve. To fight a war in
disunity is to give the enemy victory
and therefore students needed to be |
linked in order to be free, get better
education, proper housing, and well-
equipped libranes, etc.

Nanso did not look for or concen-
trate on student issues alone, mainly
because the dignity of the whole naton
was undespinned by the colonial
regime. Asa student body consisting
of intellectuals, ithadtotake account |
of the socio-economic situation in °
the country. Students cannot only be
freo at school and ‘unfree’ when they

go home. Both students and their
parents needed to be liberated.
Tam assuring the leadership of the

this nation from foreign domination
and influence. I appeal to the new
organization not to create confusion
among students countrywide. We
know whose interests they represent
and promote. They must stop swim-
ming in the pool of confusion. Their |
organization was formed to counter-
act Nanso that has stood firm in
opposition to the abuse of bnman
rights.

My question to them is: if Nanso
failed to achieve what it fought for
and a leadership vacuum does exist,
then what have they achieved so far?

If you were serious, why didn’t
you form that organizatian months
ago, lo stand up against Koevoet
elements which used to disrupt les-
sons, beat up students, and erect army
bases al schools?

With regard the formation of the
TUN: it also has political motives in
their formation, which serve the same
purpose as that of the NASEM.

¢ organization has not been
formed to strive for teachers’ umity
and interests but to counteract Nantu.

Tappeal to teachers country wide to
be careful and cautious before join-
ing any altemative union which seeks
to divide the unity which already
prevails in our nation. They should
join the organizations who strive and
work for peace, nationhood and fra-
ternity.

Forward with progresnve people's
organizations.

ALLOW me to air my views on behalf
of many. I fee! disappointed when IJ
| see follow former combatants who
are wandering around the streets of
Namibia’s cities and towns.

Being a formercombatant myself,
I feel that we are all neglected and
forgotten by the Government that we
have fought for. We had no time to
eam a living in the past years, simply
because we were engaged in the armed
struggle for the liberation of Na-
muibia. The struggle has been long
and bitter, many of our brothers and
sisters have sacrificed their precious
lives for the liberation of our mother-
land, others are crippled for life.

Now that the struggle for political
independence is won, why is it still
continuing in cases like ours? We
suffered during the years of armed
struggle in the bush, but we still
continue to suffer, even after inde-
pendence, even worse than was the
case inthe bush. We have no jobs and
if one manages to get work, then
there is no roof over his or her head.

Our qualifications, which some of
us obtained abroad, are disregarded
by employers, yet most of us have
leamed at institutions in independent
countries where there 1s no segrega-
tion or racial discrimination.

In Namibia we are asked to pro-
vide the employers with Bantu Edu-
cation certificates which in my view
18 nonsense.

It is really disappointing to learn
that most of the civil servanis in our
Government offices are former
Koevoet members who were doliber-
ately put in certain positions by the

colonial regime. Many of these people .

do not possess a Standard 10 or col-
lege certificate like many of us do.
These people were merely employod
because of the colour of their skin
and they dominate in every workplace.

Letter

We have no chance anywhere. The
Government should seriously look
into our problem and do something
about it. We read in newspapers daily
that the enemy of peace, Unita, and
their collaborators are trying to cre-
ate conditions conducive for another
war in our country. Yet the Govermn-
meant does not want to allow all those
who are able-bodied former Plan
combatants to join the national army.
Are we ignoring the realities?

The enemy want destabilization
and poverty to take root here as has
occurred in Angola and Mozambique.
It is time to think twice and make
sure that the heroes and heroines who
fought for the liberation of this coun-
try should be at least fully integrated
into the police and national army in
order to defend the gains of the revo-
lution against enemy encroachment.

We want to see the changes for
peace and independence of our people
maintained by the loyal men and
women we now see wandering around
without jobs. Reconciliauon must
make things balance.

The Government! must see to it that
these brave men and women are
assisted by the state, oven if it means
creating a demobilization fund 20
that they can make ends meet.

Law of the knife

I WISH toexpress my feelings about
the violation of human nghts in
Namibia. At this pount I would like to
urge my fellow Namibians to respect
life more than money or property.
Many people have lost their lives
since independence. Mainly because
some people do not want to respect
the laws and constitution of the
Republic of Namibia which provides
for-the protection of life, and other
human rights.

The use of knives to kill others is the
order of the day in Namibia, espe-
cially among young people. In order
to reduce or eradicate the problem
altogether, 1 appeal to the govern-
mem to introduce laws to prohibit
the carrying of knives in public places.
The knife is as dangerous as the gun,
and there must be punishment to
ensure that knife-users are deterred.
What we have to bear in mind is that
the killing of innocent people is a
violation of human righté in terms of
our laws,

Note that the constitution says that
all human beings are bom free and
equal in dignity and rights, without
distinction of any kind, such as race,
colour, sex, language, religion,

social origin, p » birth or offer

At one time I believed very strongly
that whoever is responsible for the
Timea of Namibia editorially, has
somne sort of death-wish. I could just
act believe thet axrybody with a sane
sind could write or allow such mb-
bish to be wriftes as appears in the

oven went to the extent of accepting,
which I still do, that that person went

meat into against the Times’
rund of ~ thus croating a

the democratic government will tol-

erate being belittied and called all
so 8s of names, 1s the question in the
mands of so many Namubians, and let
me assure the Times and DTA that
they are many.

I think now that the Times is cer-
tain that there 1s no action that will be
taken: there are even times when it
revertstonaked racism in its descrip-
ton of ‘black’ African countries, while
reference to South Africa creates the
impression of a docile dog creeping
with ifs tail betwoen its logs in front
of its master. Lest 1 deviate, let me
return to the issue 1 am writing about.

The belief that whatever deliber-
ately negative remarks or unfounded

[

accusations are made against the
govemment will force it to collapse,
borders on insanity. Boasting about
bnnging down the govemment singie-
handedly with such reports shock the
imagination of any human being. Itis
with this in mind that I read of the
‘Evidence on Namibian coup’ in the
October 5 edition of the Times.
The said newspaper reports exten-
sively on evidence given by Josef
Kleynhans, who told the court that
some people tned to recruit him fora
‘coup’ against the govemment. The
concept that itis only armiescapable
of staging coups, as repeatedly said
by the Times, is s0 ridiculous, but
their attempt to create the impression

that the arms theft was only a minor
‘adventure’, is, I fee] an attempt to
downplay the seriousness of the crime.
The thieves will finally, in the cyes
of the Times, be nothing more than
‘youths in search of adventure’.

I] hate to think what would have
happened if such a theft took place in
the previous dispensation and if the
‘adventurers’ were black and not white.

This comes after weeks of specu-
lation in tho same newspaper as to
whether there was really a coup plot
in Namibia or not. It is interesting, to
say the least, that this newspaper
should now have a headline report on
the coup. One wonders about this
paper's sense of journalistic ethics,
for in the past couple of weeks it
decried the coup story which was
broken by The Namibian as a ‘fig-
ment’ of that paper's imagination.

Now the Times of Namibia will
probably become the champion against
the coup. It seems to be trendy for the
Times to, on the one hand, deny the
existence of a coup and on the other
to be the first to report on evidence
given about it.

Whether one calls it an intended
coup or not, is purely academic. In

fact, the academio masturbation about -
coup or no coup does not impress the
majority ofNamiblans. Lat us at
tho facts: numerous arms .were sid
len, surely not to play ‘cowboys apd
crooks’, but to cause irreparable harm.
The simwas eurely to create havocin
Namibia.

Now tho opposition papers can
call it what they want, can even give
dissertations about ‘classical’ can- -

ans, know the arms were sjolen to
disrupt our hardwon independance
and democracy.

""Unfair to aliens’ of October 2, by
‘Fed-up Alien’. It is clear from the
detter that the anonymous writer suf-
fers from racism. My concem here,
however, is to put the matter right.

First and foremost, I hope the writer
is aware that every country has a law
relating to ‘aliens’, ‘foreigners’ and
‘illegal immigrants’ or whatever one
prefers tocall them. Such laws serve
a number of purposes. First, they
protect the security of the country.
Second, to keep a record of aliens in
the event of a population census.
Thirdly, to enable law enforcement
machinery to effectively control border
traffic.

In response to your letter, it is my
opinion that many foreigners who
came to Namibia in the past five
years did not do so because they
loved Namibia. Neither did people
from South Africa come here be-
cause they did not agree what was
happening there. After all, at that
time the same things were happening
in both countries.

If they thought what was happen-
ing in South Africa was wrong, they
should have stayed and applied their
“skills and experience’ to exert pres-
sare for change. However, these
‘skilled’ people preferred to come
and tale of the brou
shout by the ‘orkilled labour"" of
Namibia.

The government must adhere to
the constitution, which is the su-
prom law of the land. It applies to

' @veryone, whether govemment
omptoyee or not, or whether black,

white, Asian, or African.
‘The govenument cannot give citi-
pots any foteignercisiming

foreigners arrived here for different
reasons. Many of them were not
genuine. Is it not surprising to you
that most people involved in dia-
mond smuggling, rhino and ivory are
foreigners?

You claim that ‘aliens’ and ‘South
Africans’ are the only people with
skills. Many South Africans here came
because they could not be absorbed
in the South African economy. They
did not all come here with skills and
experience - the colonial policy was
to provide job opportunit#s here for
those people at the expense of the
Namibians. Namibia has been used
as a laboratory for upgrading and
training South African unskilled
labour.

The people who yame back from
exile are Namubiaiccitizens. They
were bor here and their parents and
relatives are here.

They were fighting for the inde-
pendence of this country and are
fully qualified as citizens.

I WAS made to believe that there is
_ aconflict of interests in this country
— in the field of employment.

IT am saying this because previous
history shows that in the past job
apphcants were just taken in or
employed without pre-conditions. As
a result, there are many government
employees with less than Std 8 quali-
fications.

The buming issue today is the Std
8 certifitates and its impact on the
Namibian labour force. As we start
to reap the fruits of our country's
independence which we have fought
and died for, lying ahead is a politi-
cally-motivated blocking mechanism,
the Std 8 issue. Now, how can one
enjoy the fruits of hard-won inde-
pendence, if he/she does not possess
a Std 8 certificate?

Where do we go for a living, when
you are likely to face three questions:
Std 8 certificate; long-term job expe-
rience; and previous employer.

It is disappointing to have a door
closed in your face because you don't
have aSb& certificate. What about
those with practical expenence?

This is a disturbing issue. How do
they expect someone who was forced
to leave the country and fight to
liberate it, to surmount this blocking
mechanism?

The government of this oountry
inherited a large number of people

with long-term job experience. Why

— can’t they deputise these people with

_ lees eoxporicaced staff so that we can |

create mutual understanding and a
skilled labour force?

The Std 8 question is promoting
division between the haves and have
nots.

Iam thus suggesting to the law- :
makers that we get together and for-
mulate a 9ommon ma pou ne to how to
redress with rogers."

f Misch 21 means ..

THERE are only « few days
left before we celcbrate the
first anniversary of our hard-
won independence. It was 12
moaths ago when the popular
ruling party. Swapo, the then
Hberation movement which
gallantly fought and defeated
the then notorious forces of
occupation at the battlefront as
well as the ballot box, adopted
the policy of national recon-
ciliation, the policy of forgive-
ness and focus on the future.

First of all, let ue examine
the significance of March 21.
The date is and will remain an
illuminating day in the Na.
mibian calendar. Illuminating
in the sense that itis the day on
which the yoke of colomalism.
which was imposed on us, was
buried for ever.

It was the day on which
dignitaries from all over the
world joined the brave sons
and daughters of this country
to witness the burial of coloni-
alism by replacing the South
Afncan flag with that of the
new Republic of Namibia.

It was a wonderful and
moving occasion, which pres-
ent and future generations will
never forget. It was a day on
which the nationalist fighters
stood hand in hand and said
‘look, our sacrifices have not
been in vain’.

As the freedom fightars were
rejoicing, those who fought
against the emergence of
democracy stood with their
hands on their heads.

Why was it necessary to adopt
the policy of national recon-
ciliatian? The movement's aims
and objectives were to liberate
this coumtry from the then forces
of colonial oppression and
establish a government founded
upon the will and participation
of the Namibian people.
uns achioved that, the

-——

colonial regime with the view
of the achievement
of democracy. With this in mind,
Swapo opted for a policy of
national reconciliation which
is humane and suitable for
Namibians.

The most striking aspect of
the policy is that it promotes
the values of equality and human
dignity. It intends to unite the
Namubian people irrespective
of colour, race, nationality or
ongin. This policy deserves
our respect.

Many have complained about

» the negative aspects of national

reconciliation but Little has been
heard about its ments

The success of the policy
depends on the performances
of those implementing it. The
ments of this policy are more
than its dements. This policy
is, in my view, meant to pro-
vide a breathing space for those
harbounng illusions about the
past colomal system to adjust
themselves to a new era of
national independence, peace,
stability and the humane ap-
proach.

As we rejoiced on March 21
last year, we were equally
womied about what we had
inhented from the then noton-
ous colonial regime in terms
of debt, unemployment and
pobtical instability (the latter
with regard to tendencies of
tnbalism and racial discnnu-
nation based on colour)

The probleniis, how are we
going lo pay the socalled debt
without economic prospenty,
and how are we going to com-
bat the already deteriorating
unemployment situation with-
out economic growth?

The government's efforts to
combat the unemployment
situation will be meaningless
unless accompanied dy the will
and voluntary participation of
the ‘haves’ of our society.

We expected the electranic
and print mediatoplay a major
role in shaping the destiny of
our people. But at the moment,
its efforts aro feeble because
we aro divided. We have just

emerged from s unique oolo-
nial system, a system in which

our people were taught to behave
in a tribalistic manner. This
evil sysiom has contaminated
the minds of some members of
our society, making it difficult
for them to adjust to the new
era of independence. The media
should be offering guidance to
our people to create for them
opportunities to rebuild their
self-respect, restore their faith
and rediscover for themselves
their human dignity. Regional
radio stations should be utl-
ised for the bene fil of people in
those regions.

Oue of the Government's
nian pnonties 1s education. It
1s the finest foundation of all
for the nation-building proc-
ess. Its also the comerstone
upon which 1a rest our surest
hopes to build our young Re-
public

As we approach the first
anniversary of independence,
we necd tn be devoted to the
cause of national building
through the process of national
reconciliation.

Fauure to implement this
posinvely will effect the con-
cept of democracy in this coun-
try.

We cannot achieve any of
these objectives unless we are
hardworking, disciplined, law-
abiding and unplement the
policy of national reconcili-
ation un 2 positive light.

to tum and transform our soci-
cty in its writing of its own

As we find ourselves envel-
oped in this vibrant situation,
brothers and sisters, we must
be careful that we do not create
a situation where privilege by
virtue of colour is replaced by
privilege by virtue of wealth
and whereby only the ‘haves’
enjoy the luxunes or creature
comforts while the ‘have-nots’
are forced to accept poverty as
their final destiny.

We who are govemed com-
rades must bear in mind that
our new Namibian nation re-
quires of everyone of us to be
a new person, with a new mind,
a new heart and a new spint. I
also believe that the hope for
Namibia does not just lie ina |
political system or with a spe-
cific government. it lies with
us, the people, black and white,
who have come through the
crisis and have had to change.
We need new minds, new hearts
and new spirits, hewn, as they
have been, from pain and
humiliation, from repentance
and forgiveness. Therefore we
must not expect our govermn-
meat to perform muracles while
we ourselves have not begun

Wecommend your Govein-
ment, sir, for recognising the
need to educate our young-
sters. The budget allocation to
the Ministry of Education and
Culture is proof of this. We
know that the allocated funds
to this Ministry will not solve
all the educational problemsio
this country, for they are in-

out recently that opposition

defend for the sake of defeod-
ing only. We hope that our

ngAH9u283CHI3BRAnCJ03JHzEAzPqInvPCIk3EHA,"Constructive Idea

I AM writing to advise the
Ministry of Defence not to
misuse this time of peace.

Too much of a good thing is
monotonous. Soldiers in bases
around the country have no
work to do, except continuous
manocuvres and this brings
boredom.

On many occasions soldiers
are told to attend classes but
due to boredom they go absent
without leave.

My suggestion is that the
Ministry should take advan-
tage of this, and utilise the
soldiers in bases inthese times
of peace.

It would be better if the
Ministry could provide build-
ers to show soldiers how to
construct their own barracks
and provide them with bull-
dozers and tractors to lake part
in agneultural projects.

It we keep our soldiera busy
with productive tusks as wel!
as Constructive ones, this will
give us a good reputation with
the nation.

Soldiers need to be taught
skills so that they could join
workers’ brigades with better
qualifications whenever they
leave their posts,

The more they produce, the
more they will reserve; the more
they construct, the more: they
will protect; the harder they

that the people of thif area owe

as usual

ALLOW me to congratulate
the Cabinet of the Namibian
Government for its decision to
withdraw the licence of thee
Hotel Onduri in Outjo. This
was a much needed sign to all
racists that the status quo can-
not be allowed to continue.

The policy of national rec-
Onciliation has been abused time
and again by those who cannot
accept change and in fact are
still opposed to Namibia's
independence. Incidents of
racism frequently occur, espe-
cially in outlying areas, and in
my opinion the government has

_ been far too lenient in its ac-
tions thus far.

This encouraged the reac-
tionary forces to continue
‘business as usual’; workers
are still victimised tad exploited
while the ‘white’ privileges
remain untouched.

Social justice 1s a prerequi-
site for peace and democracy
and hopefully the Outjo deci-
sion will send a clear signal
that racism cannot be allowed
to continue. All incidents of |

racism should be dealt with in
the same consequent manner.

Now we kre women in peace.
| Let ya have ourchance to fulfil
our ‘nepirations to help our

‘cotintry to emerge from the
‘darkness’ of , inequal-
ity and grinding poverty. The
dreams of a Nanubia
will be doomed in the absence
of women's participation. On
top of that, the idea that all
people, the youth, the women
and the elderly should be in-
volved in the development
process isan extremely impor-
{amt one, particularly af this
time when Namibia needs to
marshall all its available re-
sources for development. Ef-
fective utilisation of human
resources at all levels and all
dimensions, is key to the pro-
motion of real development in
Namibia.

The time has come that a
change of attitude must take
place. Women have now for
some time realised that we have
the potential (social, economic
and political) and wisdom to
shape the future of this coun-
try. We therefore nghtfully

demand the opportunity to have |

this vajuable potential fully

tapped fur the development of |

Namibia. Machinery to enable
women of Namubia to fully
participate in the development
of our motherland must be put
in place.

Women’s participation will
change society and liberate
women. Women's struggic
must not be seen in one dimen-
gion, as simply a struggic against
men. See the many aspects of
the structural dimension (so-
cial, political, cultural and
economic).

Struggle means awareness.
Struggle means organisation
and unity. Struggle means
courage, struggle means faith
and hope. We must begin to
build these up in our small
circles and link up with one
another. Nobody can help in
this process more than women
ourselves, Let us mobilise and
organise ourselves for cystem-
atic involvement in change. Let
‘us support ourse} ves in organi-

like peopie from Windhoek are

than us. High- ranking jobs are
preferably given to those
comung from the capital, who
maght not necessanly have
appled for them, instead of
people un the sub-urban and

Chief’s tribalism

I WOULD like to refer to the
socalled revelations by Chief
Mamili published in The
Namibian entitled ‘The Mafwe
state their case’ on August 31.

If this revelation comes from
the Chief himself then all peace
and freedom-loving Namibi.
ans should without hesitation
declare him the 1991 cham-
pion of tnbalism - for it ap-
pears he is unable to think
beyond the tnbe.

The point I would like to
make to Chief Mamuli and a
small section of the Mafwe
surrounding him is that the
cheapest colonisation method
used to colonise Namibia was
through the existence of tnbes
- the championing of one tnbe
at the expense of others so asto
smoothly pave the way for the
bantustanisaton of Namibia.

It is disappointing to learn
that Chief Mamili claims Ka-
tima Mulilo is a Mafwe area.
Capnvi knew no boundanes
even in the time of the colon:-
alists.

Why should we talk of tribal
divisions and tnbal bounda-
nies at this time? What are we
going to benefit from tribal
conflicts apart from rolling back
the progressive idea of national
reconciliation the ruling party
is keen to implement in order
to mould a healthy and pros-
perous nation?

Money for tribes

1 AM very unhappy about the

| Way money is spent by the
Government on issues related
to tnbalism in Caprivi. The
Govemment of the day is no:
aware thatthe Basubiais using
it to defend tribalism. On the
other hand, the Mafwe are left
victims of the tribal acts of the
Basubia, while the government
dangles its legs on the fence of
prospenty.

Chief Moraliswam should be
called to order by the Govern-
ment. And those who were
involved in the unconstitutional
inauguration of the chief as
Paramount Chief be disciplined
accordingly. The Basubia have
gone too far with their abuse of
democracy and now 1s the time
they should be given a lecture
to bang them tu their senses.

Much has been said about
the Basubia and the Mafwe arc
fed up with them. If the Gov-
emment fails to discipline them,
the Mafwe are bound to doit

The military and police were

_ despatched to Capnvi in the
name of mataining peace.
Recently the Basubia cheated
the government to say that
people are being lalled in the
Capnvi and that there were
many in the moruary, many
injured and many admutted to
hospital. Forces were des-
patched but found the claims
unfounded. What a waste of
laxpayers) monev The Bas.
ubia should know tha: this
money is supposed to be used
for capital projects to the ad-
vantage of Namibians and not
just one tmba: group. i call
upon taxpayers to condemn the
abuse of money un this man-
ner.

[In the history of Namibia no
chiefhas ever been made para-
mount over one tnbe let alone
another chief's temtory. Moral-
iswani 1s geographically not
really a chief because he lives
under the junsdiction of an-
other chief, and his advisors,
like Likando and Mwazi, should
make him aware of this.

The same chief should re-
member how his Khuta used to
punish the youth to impress
the Boers (Mayumbelo, Juluka
and Sampati are alive and can
bear this out); and the same
Basubia told the Boers how
pro-Swapo the Mafwe were in
the past. The opposite is now
taking place with the group

claiming that Swapo is theirs
and DTA is for Mafwe - what
double standards! J call on the
Govemment to intervene and
to call the two chiofs to order."

On Walvis Bay

An open letter to
UN Secretary General
Dr Boutros Boutros Gali

IN VIEW of Namibia's sec-
ond anniversary of independ-
ence, I would like to express
my deservedly deep concer
about parts of our country still
under foreign domination.
Whiting straight to you proba-
bly reveals my ignorance re-
garding the ‘correct method’
of communicating with you.
However, deliberate depriva-
tion and annihilation during
the tragic colonial era would
justify my shortcomings. No
wonder, Namibia’s current
more than 50 per cent illiter-
acy rate. 7
Nowhere in the world, at
of Nations and subsequently
the United Nations’ existence,
were more resolutions passed,
defied, overlooked and/or for-
gotten than in the world body’s
former ‘baby’ for which it had
direct responsibility.
The long colonial years di-
lapidated both Namibia’s un-
renewable natural and human

still paying reparations to each
other after the two world wars.
Regardless of her plunder at
the expense of growth, pro-
duction, literacy and self-suf-
ficiency, Namibia has her sec-
ond anniversary of sovereignty
in debt and heavily dependent
upon imports.

Worse still, more than 90
per cent of her imported com-
modities are handled in Walvis
Bay, her only deepwater port.
Unfortunately, to our detriment,
Walvis Bay is apparently still
considered as part of South
Africa. Twelve, if not more of
Namibia’s offshore islands are
also still under South African
control, thus effectively reduc-
ing the area covered by the
country’s offshore rights by
about one-fifth.

If part of the world body’s
responsibilities is to safeguard
peace, security, self-determi-
nation of member states: and
observation of good faith and
overwhelming justice towards

all nations, then Namibia de-
serves its long-violated rights
and national integrity honoured.
I therefore, on behalf of the
Namibian people, request your
organistion to ensure that jus-
tice prevails and that Walvis
Bay and the offshore islands
are retumed to the authentic
control of the indigenous popu-
lation - the Namibian people. I
should be grateful to see the
new world order incorporating
all parts of this fragile world.

Enemy of peace

AS a patriot and 4 democrat, I

would like to respond to Dr
Petrus J Krige’s letter which
appeared in The Namibian on
April 3.

First I would like to make it
clear that the policy of na-
tional reconciliation was unani-
mously declared asa national
policy and not only the Presi-

tions have to make sure that
the policy goes deep into the
roots of this country and is
clearly understood by all citi-
zens. This is the task of every
Namibian. For that matter, Dr
Knige is not only against the
prevailing atmosphere in this
country, but he is also against
its independence, as such he is
an enemy of peace and justice.

There is no one in this coun-
try who would support his line,
except perhaps a few friends
who are suffering from the same
disease.

When we talk about recon-
ciliation, we mean business,
and we do not judge people by
colour, sex, political affiliation,

ideological differences or be-
liefs.

Tt is untrue to say that the

Government of Namibia does
not allow judges and sport
participants from South Af-
rica while it allows imports
from the same country. J think
you are joking, and are obvi-
ously not a Namibian. If you
are, then you don’t need to get
a job, but re-orientation and
attend lectures to familiarise
yourself with what is happen”
- ing in Namibia. You must be
the first ignorant intellectual
in Namibia.

Regarding culture, the Gov-
ernment of Namibia is ademo-
cratic one, and I can assure you
that it doesn’t limit rights and

freedoms as you maintain. .

Everyone has the nght to en-
joy his or her cultural heritage
provided that this is in keeping
with article 19 of the
Constitution of Namibia.

I think that his theory is
misleading, if not inciting hatred
among Namibians. Since you
are a doctor in musicology,
maybe you need a medical
doctor to cure you of the dis-
ease called a superiority com-
plex and your racism. It is a
pity we still have people in this
country who are anti-progress

dent or Government institu- .

and anti-nation building.

Are you also saying that
Namibians are unable to do
administrative work? And are
you saying that Namubians
should not be appointed to high
positions? I believe that all
Namibians, irrespective of
colour, should have equal
opportunities and be able to
run state machinery. Don’t
underestimate the abilities of
Namibian people, sir. It is not
only foreigners who can do
these jobs.

Neither should you insult our
national anthem. ‘Freedom
fight” has no undesirable or
negative connotations. It is only
your ignorant, anti-democratic
and racist sentiments. Who are
the Namibians who live inside
the country who don't share
the same sentiment regarding
this? You are an autocrat and
cannot talk on behalf of demo-
crats. Who gave you the man-
date to do so?

J don’t think you can pre-
tend not to know why Swapo
opted for the armed struggle.
There is hardly anyone, even
non-citizens of this country,
who do not know, this.

‘You are not only against —

Swapo as the ruling y party, but

also against the Namibian .

people. You do not even honour
people who sacnificed their lives
for the cause of this country
and now you want to be given
a job, probably as a director,
because you think you are the
best and only musicologist in
this country.

I feel sorry for you sir. Be-

sides musicology, you appear
to be totally empty politically.
National reconciliation is our
policy and if you don’t like it
you should go to a place where
there is no peace and justice,
since you want the policy tobe
reversed. Think twice, sir, and
learn from your mistakes.

Basibia finally won its inde-
pendence. Now the Basibian
people were free to shape their
own nation.

“Now we can be just like

some of the people. “Oh no”,
said others, “we must learn
from our brothers and sisters.
We will follow their successes
and avoid their mistakes”

Basibia adopted a
constitution that was admired
all over the world because it
made Basibia a tue democ-

BAPPA swept to victory in
Basibia’s first election as an

it promused to live up to is

and ‘Build a New Basibia tor

of Basia and was much loved
by them.

“We are all Basibians to-
gether’, he said. “Every man,
woman and child in this na-
tion is my family, and I will
not rest while any of my people
are suffering”.

“That is fine”, said some of
the members of BAPPA, “but
now we must talk about our
salaries. To keep the peace.
we have promised all the gov-
eminent employees who were
hired before independence that
their salaries will not be re-
duced. So we must pay our-
selves at least as much as
they are getting, or perhaps
even more”

“No”, said the President
“those people were robbing
our country. Why should we
follow in their footsteps? Be-
cause we work for the gov-
emument, we are given houses
to live in while many of our
people are homeless. The state
even gives us pensions and
medical aid. We will pay
ourselves modest suanes. And
Thave State House to live mn
and a government car to travel
in - I will be well taken care
of. My salary must be the
lowest of all”.

“But, Comrade President’,
the others cried, “you cin't
do that. You are the father of
the nation. Surely your salary
must be the highest. No leader
of any other country would
do such a thing”.

‘And the President replied
“You say that | am the father

would eat while his children
go hungry? A true leader does
not separate himself from his

“But Comrade President”,
they said, “all the highest

independence drove expen-

State all over the world!”

“Yes”, said the President
“but we will be different. We
will set an example. A truce

himself from the people. You
must remember that most of
the people of Basibia cannot

many trips to other counmes.
We must share ideas and
discuss issues and make agree-
ments with the people of other
nations”.

“This is true”. said the Presi-
dent, “we must do some Tav-
elling. But we must always
think of savug money. None
of my ministers will fly first
class, and we will always stay
in the cheapest hotels”.

“But Comrade President,
they said, a government min-
ister must travel in style. You
would not want your Mmunis-
ters to be crowded and un-
comfortable”

And the President said “how
can you talk about being
crowded and uncomfortable
when have seen some of our
people living in the single
quarters, 10 and 20 people
sleeping in one tny room,
every night of their lives?”

“But what about you, com-
rade President?”, they said,
“you must have your own
plane forefficiency and s¢cu-

rity”.
“Very well, bul we must
find the’smallest, cheapest,

simplest plane that can take
me where [ need to go. A true

leader does not separate
himpelf from the people. We
are going to setanexample to
the world”.

It was not long before a
delegation came from Parlia-
ment to visit the President.
“Comrade President’, they
said, “this cannot continue.
We are Basibia’s leaders. We
fought for independence and
now we deserve our reward”.

“Yes”, said the President.
“but we did not fight alone
Would any of us be here in
goverment today if we had
not had the support of our
people? All Basbians deserve
the reward of a new Basibia
where all can prosper”.

“But, comrade President”,
they said, “no other country
in the warld operates this way.
We will be the laughing stock
of Afnca”.

“No”, sad the President, “7
think you are going to be sur-
prised”.

And it was not long before
anew spint came to Basibid -
aspiritof giving and sharing.
Government muinistnes held
compeutons to see which ones
could save the most money
Somme of the civil servants who
had been hired before inde-
pendence were so embarrassed
about their high salanes that
they asked for salary culs.
Even private citizens sold ther
fancy cars because it was so
unfashionable to be seen in
them.

And the government spent
money on health care and
education and Literacy train-
ing and development projects
and social secunty payments
for the old and unemployed.
It was not long before the
standard of living of every
single person in Basibia had
nsen. No one was hungry.
Children were healthier.
Everyone in Basibia had a
home, and almost everyone
could read. Ard the govern-
menthad been so careful with
its money tha: Basibia was
not dependent on foreign aid.
Basibia was truly free.

The President was respected
and admired more than any
other leader in any county in
the history of the world All
over Basibia people said “A
true leader does not separate
himself from the people”. They
voted for BAPPA again and
again, and Basibia remained
peaceful and prosperous.

And soon Basibia was fa-
mous. No other nation had
ever dared 10 be so different.
Visitors came streaming in
from ail over the world 10 see
this remarkable place. New
investors were attracted 10
Basibia because tl was SO
unique. People in every land
recognised the wisdom of the
President of Basibia and he
was awarded many honours
(which he always accepted in
the name of al! Basibians).

Basibians had once said
“We must be like all other
counties”. Now people in

othercountries said “we want
to be like Basibia”

And thatis how one small
nation began to change the
world

ANON

The jet outcry

IT has never been part of my
culture to engage myself in
public debates which are being
over-emphasised for polincal
gain.

In the face of the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an R80 mil-
hon jet for the Government
and officials of the Republic
of Namubia, I was faced with
several questions which I could
not help to answer.

I fully concur with the fact
thatour county faces numer-
ous problems, some short tem
and others long term. Take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane

Now the question is whether
it ig tue that those ‘Muyon-
gos’ who presuppose that the
R8O million could have been
better spent uf used for tehet
programmes are more sensi-
tive to the realities in Na-
mibia? If so, how far back
have they (Muyongos) been
so critical about the way in
which taxpayers’ money has
been spent for the purchase
of things such as Casspirs and
Mirages by their regime, the
former interim government?

Or, docs Muyongo wantus
to believe that the money mus-
used on the purchase of war
material at the ume of their
rule was ‘ess than R80 mil-
lion? And was it not taxpay-
ers’ money?

This country has inhented
a debt which i has to repay
due to the misuse of funds
and the cnminal war which
was impesed on our people.
Again, does Muyongo want
us to accept that the drought
and other social evils in our
country today are new hap-
penings? T assume not.

Unemployment. hunger, [0
mention but a few, are the
legacy of the past history ot
the country. Even at the tume
of successive colonial regimes.
the problems were there.

As these problems did not
prevent them (the Muyongos)
from purchasing wanton war
matenals which ran to bil-
ons of Rands which this
country is left to repay today,
likewise, should these pre-
vent the legitimate govern:
ment from purchasing a plane
which will enable the Presi-
dent and other Government
officials to maintain contacts
with the outside world for the
benefit of the people of this
country?

Even if the plane were not
purchased, could there be

t is Surprising that
Government and pectin
the Office Of the Prime Min,
ister is Prepared to Mislead
Public opinion by appointing
someone tO investigate the
acquisition of lang by only
three people and especially
in the Communal areas. That
office being responsible for
the implementation of the Land»

- recommenda-
tons could have Started there

to solve the national issue of
land.

Itis also surprising that the
Government, whenever it talks
of the legal or rightful acqui-
sition of land, only concen-
trates on communal land. Let
it be stated here categorically
Clearly that we the Namibian
people, and especially those
of us who laboriously fought
to return back our stolen land,
did so for the whole of Na-
mibia including the socalled
commercial farmland.

Lasting peace and stability

in this country could only come
if equitable distribution of land
is done now and not later. The
question of senior officials
acquiring land only demon-
Strates to us that people are
hungry for land. Lf senior of-
ficials have the means of us-
ing their official positions to
acquire the land, the mass of
our people who on numerous
occasions have demonstrated
publicly to have the land ques-
tion settled, may one day take
up arms to revoke the present
Status quo as far as land own-
ership is concerned.

It is hurtful to note that the
land price is artificially made
to be exhorbitantly high to
benefit those who forcefully
took control of our people
and ownership of our land.
Once cannot accept that in
Windhoek it is practically im-
possible to buy a piece of
land to build a dwelling.

So, Mr Prime Minister, we
the silent majority, who fought
for the liberation of this coun-
try and suffered imprisonment
and detention for the libera-
tion of this country, who dem-
onstrated fearlessly in the
streets of Windhoek, Katu-
tura, mines, schools, did so to
ensure that Namibia is free.
We who voted the Swapo gov-
emment to power want our
land NOW. We expect you
urgently to implement the Land
Conference recommenda-
tions. The more delays to the
solution of this probicin. the
‘more our path::. - will run
out. Land is a fundamental
right of every citizen of our
country. Land is the source of

those who have a desire to
Own land will have access to
It.

If this suggestion is not
workable, may I ask the Gov-
¢mment to put the question to
the electorate during regional
elections which are due be-

fore the end of the year. I
think that the verdict of the

majority of people is neces-
sary. My verdict is that we
are being held hostage by an
unpatriotic few who think of
Namibia in terms of their own
benefit alone and who through
their access are misleading
public opinion. Commercial
farms are not touched now,
butare they able torespond to
the urgent need for food in
this country? I am pretty sure
and convinced that if access
to land was easy, the effect of
the present natural calamity
would not be the same. Be-
Cause more people could have
engaged in food production.

I want to point out that the
Namibian food market is rela-
tively stable because the pres-
sure is reduced by the com-
munal land which provided
71 per cent of the livelihood
of the inhabitants of those
areas. Now the population of
both animals and people is
increasing, and the ecology
has taken its toll because of
the way in which the land has
been over-utilised. The logi-
cal solution is therefore the
urgent need to solve this
question. We want our land
back.

On Earth Summit

THE Earth Summit presently
being held in Brazil once again
highlights the precarious po-
sition Planet Earth finds itself
in because of the short-sighted,
profit-oriented exploitation of
its natural resources.

It also shows that if man
has learned anything from
history, it is the fact that man
never seems to learn from
history. ,

Take, for instance, the av-
erage cilizen’s matter-of-fact

‘attitude towards the environ-
ment, especially in our still
developing, relatively non-
industrialised county.

A FEW days from now,”
Namibians from all walks
of life will commemorate
Heroes Day on August 26.

Significantly this is a
remarkable day, because of
the nature of the liberation
activities which occurred on
that day between the indige-
nous brave sons and daugh-
ters of this country and the
then colonial forces al
Ongulumbashe in the north-
erm part of the country.

Those liberation activities
germinated or brought about
national independence and
cemocracy. It has been a
bitter struggle as it was
depicted by the Honourable
Minister and veteran politi-
cian Andimba Toivo ya
Toivo during his political
trial.

It was a life or death situ-
ation but despite that, the

Peace at last

a es a

PEACE has descended
py} upon Windhoek West

once again. The srudents

celebrated their ‘cul-
| tural’ festival and resi-
Gents were powerless tc
defend themselves from _
the onslaught. :

In case one is accused
of exaggeration, | am
talking about four nights
(I fell askeep by 3am) of
disco music blasting
| over the entire area -
_ | every syllable of every
| song trespassed closed

windows, locks doors,

earplugs - right into the
| furthest crevice of one’s
| | bedroom.

The police were also
powerless to restore
Peace because Vice-
Chancellor Peter
Katjavivi and Dean
Kandetu “had given their
permission”. Acomment
from the Minister of
Home Affairs would be |
appreciated on this point, :
Since when can two in-
dividuals muzzle the
police force from de-
fending peace-abiding
| cituzens?

A strange state of af-
fairs - Vice Chancellor
Katyavivi and Dean
Kandetu held control
over the police and the
Windhoek West taxpay-
crs, rate-payers, rent-
payers - those mere—
mortals who have to
work for a living.

The two University —
chiefs were indifferent |
to residents’ direct ap-
peals as well as police
wamings after the first
night's assault. This
could be due to several
reasons, all worrying:

- perhaps they had in
fact lost control;

- of perhaps they were
trying to ingratiate them-
selves with the students?
Very cheap!

- perhaps they consid- |
ered it an important les-
£0n in democracy for the
future leaders of our
country. Those privi-
leged students are more
entitled to rights than
workers.

Considering this was
not the first rowdy cam-
pus rumpus and thanks
to the two liberal univer-
sity heads, it will obvi-
ously not be the last, per-
haps Windhock West
rate-payers should de-

preciation of property in

ngBI1B586CoJlCSFoDK37KIQFMUPoJosQBTl5FIz,"~ On civil service

IT is only when we the
civil servants are well-
informed about the eth-
ics and responsibilities
of civil servants that the
majority of staff mem-
bers will be able to ad-
just themselves to the
ongoing restructural
problem.

It is obvious that the
progress, pf any country.
is seriotisly jeopardised
when the civil servants
are not well informed
about the ethics and re-
sponsibilities of civil
servanis.

In his address during
the workshop organised
for permanent sceerctar-
ics at Gross Barmen, the
Right Honourable Prime
Minister, Comrade Hage
Geingob, emphasised the
following:

* gucucs al govern-
ment offices: .

* the need for perma-
Nenlsecretarics lO assess
people's feelings about
the quality of service they
receive,

* terminally buresu-
cratic offices:

*sense of commilment
and dedication;

* the use of the tel-
ephone:

* recruitment, promo-
tion and responsibility
and accountability.

IL is my personal un- |
derstanding that civil '
servants must be acutely
conscious of the crucial
role they play in achicv-
ing government abjec-
tives of bringing about
peace, orderly develop-
ment and prosperity to
the country. Obviously,
we can only achieve this
through the act of creat-
ing awareness and
through individual com-
mitment.

All the remarks made
by the Prime Minister
reflect the daily occur-
rence in individual
ministeries. Some per-
manent secretaries de-
cide to be exclusive and
some are so dismissive
that they are no longer in
contact with theirstaffin
particular and the public
in general. Some resort
to so much secrecy that
they are nol aware as (0

ALLOW me to express the feelings of ruling party
Members in your newspaper. We in Swapo are
committed to democratic principles and therefore
Swapo ts calling on registered voters to exercise
their democratic nghts to vote in the coming general
elections.

We are not campaigning fora two-thirds majority
but for the overwhelming majority to rule this
country. Itis nota seeret that we are ruling, and we
have and will continue to rule Namibia according to
the democratic structures put in place by Swapo.

We in Swapo believe and know that democracy
will stay forever in this country.

Other parties have often relied on tribalism and
racism to promote their cause and they therefore can
claim to represent Namibia as a whole. It should
therefore be a wonder that Swapo has provided four
and a half years of peace and tranquility in Namibia.

We live in peace today because of the commit-
ment of Swapo to seck unity in diversity in our
country.

In spite of the fact that some opposition parties
have insulted S wapo leaders personally, itis Swapo’s
leadership and maturity that has never wavered
from the commitment to freedom of speech.

In the past years Swapo has committed itself to

nation-building, knowing that Namibians deservea
government that has priorities as they do. The
Swapo leadership has ensured development and
they also believe there must be contact between
government and people at all levels. That 1s why
Swapo has branches and sections at grassroots
level.

The Foreign Investment Act was passed, which
regulates the framework tor foreign investors. In-
come tax was reduced twice. Job creation was one
of the top priorities.

In the next five years Swapo’s priority will be to
secure existing jobs and create new ones. For exam-
ple the Free Trade Zone will create more Jobs for
Namibians and that is part of Swapo’s priorities for
the next five years.

Tourism will be expanded and housing, water,
electricity, education, health, agriculture and fish-
eries will be promoted.

Therefore in the next five years Swapo will accel-
erate change by creating new opportunities for
Namibians through economic growth, better educa-
tion and health services and more Jobs.

_ questions as to whether Swap: <>

fulrilled the promises it made in 1989
an how many people have used the
Falcon jet?

Of course Swapo fulfilled its prom-
ises, We are now living in better hous-
ing, have better communication fa-
cilities, better education, better
healthcare and Swapo has also re-
duced the unemployment rate. We are
how living in peace, no more
‘makakunyas’ destroying our maize
fields and beating up people and
Swapo has buried apartheid forever.

With regard the jet, how many peo-

ple does Mr Muyongo feel should
have used it? Does he want everyone
to use 1t? The Falcon is not a taxi but
wan sport for the President and his Min-
isters.

I strongly believe people will not
vote DTA and that they will lose the
forthcoming electicns with no single
seat in Parliament.

President Nujoma should not con-
cern himself about the DTA in the
coming elecuons. Swapo will make
sure he rules this country for the rest of
his life.

letter the Minister
maintained hiy views
had no links with Na-

kind of genetic engi-

letter, whether inten-
ttonal or not, echoes the
very worst aspects of a
Nazu-style philosophy.

We have read with in-
creasing abhorrence
some of the remarks
made by the Minister in
his three letters, which
we publishedonly inthe
interests of free speech.

both said, HAN cannot
have it both ways.
Minister Hanekom
also requested that our

that Minister Hanekom
Is essentially advocating
a regulated market, sim-
ply for the sake of what
he hopes will be some
degree of Peace in the
industry. But such a
compromise will not
bring peace, because it
will not address the one
question that we have
always posed: Why
should successful small
businesses be driven out

‘of Business, just because

they are small?

Mr Johnnie Hamman,
the new chairperson of

Saying this, he pretends

Spinit of generous com-
promise, by stating that
although we cannot ac-
cept the wiping out of
the business of 95 per
cent of our members, we
will accept the destruc-
tton of 65 per cent? Or
would 55 per cent be
Sufficient for Mr
Hamman and HAN?
What Mr Hamman
and some members of
HAN are Proposing is,
in fact, much more than
the destruction of, say,
thirty or fifty successful
small businesses. They
are proposing that new
legislation should out-
law the prospect of most

Namibians ever being
able to share in the ac-
commodation imdustry
of their own country in
an cnurcpeneurial way.
They are effectively pro-
posing that no home-
stead in the north of Na-
mibia should be able to
offer accommodation to
tourists. They are effec-
lively proposing that no
resident of, say, Rundu
or Otjimbingwe should
employ the facilities at
her or his disposal to of-
fer accommodation
commercially. They are
effectively proposing
that no Namibian with-
out access to capital re-

» Mr Hanekom

sources of at least half a
milton dollars (at inter-
est rates of above 20 per
cent) should be able to
enter the accommoda-
tion industry. And they
are demanding that the
Namuibtan state should
ratify this discrimination
against its own citizens.

We call upon the me-
dia and the public to rec-
ognise that this issue is
not simply a matter of a
disagreement with HAN
and the Budget and
Home Accommodation
Assocrauion. It is a mat-
ter of principle: and that
principle involves the
question of whether or

not the majority of
Namibians, who were
denied meaningful ac-
cess to economic activ-
ity under apartheid, will
continue to be denied it
under new legislation of
the type proposed by
those who benefited -
and stull benefit - under
the outdated Ordinance
20 of 1973. If members
of HAN are successful
in their demands, then
economic reactionaries
in other sectors will be
encouraged to attempt
the same.

of crime in our country, ¢.g. theft,

feeling or conscience. People must
cooperate with the police in order make

eye on their children and act immedt-
ately if they suspect that there ts Cause

avoid places like night clubs because
these are very dangerous places for a
young person to spend time. The time
has come for the public to take a visible
stand against people who wish to pro-

should be treated like enemies. I call on
all Namibians ... Iet us all go down on
our knees and pray to God to intervene
and to bless us with peace, love and
understanding. As long as we allow
criminals to enjoy a free reign in our
community we will never know peace.

ngCJ4C283EJKpDTwpCb04LJPGCVRsKpDREKmpGJw,"Guilt On His Mind After Death

YES. thisishow we have

atl fourned of the death

Of Moses Garocb. Now
hat he as dead, Moses
Gurocb will be a differ:
ent man. Different from
the Moses Garoeb who
lived during the libera-
tion movement. On the
occasion of his death,
may I convey, through

this newspaper, my con-
dolences to those who
loved and appreciated
him as father and hus-
band.

May the “unusual” re-
avuion to his death make
them an exception. At
this ime of sorrow f do
Not want to add insult to
injury of Mr Garoeb’s
fumily.

Mfoses Garoeb dies as
inan with guileon fis
mind. He has totally

failed to openly admit
thathe was, together with
others, responsible for
murdering many inno-
cent sons and daughters
of the country. Although
he died a troubled death,
he is in his motherland.
He was buried as a
“hero” in disguise.

fam bitter. Moses
Garoeh has left his Po-
hitroal successors to in-
berst blood stained

“files”,

In that sense his death
isunumely. They are left
with unanswered ques-
tions about the Lubango
genocide.

I have always urged
Swapo leaders to clear
this dark part of our re-
cent history, but with no
SUCCESS.

Will we have to wait
until the last butcherdies
and been afforded a he-
ros funeral before we
find answers to this ques-
ton?

Today many families
are cry ing for their loved
ones who were murdered
by the notorious Swapo
security menin Lubango

of which Moses Garoeb
made a part. He has never
been and will never be a
hero as far as I am con-
cemed. I have seen him
victumising us. Lucky
enough, I have survived
to tell the tale. For as
long as the fate of the
Lubango victims is not

cleared | will die with a

troubled hean and Na-
mibra wall never know

genuine peace.

I know just as every-
one does, that anyone,
good or bad, can be
named a hero as long as
his/her comrades are in
power. That is why the
“heroes” of the apartheid
era are now removed
from the face of Na-
mibia. Streetnames have
been changed because
friends of the apartheid
“heroes” are no longer
In power.

For those who glorify
Moses Garoeb as a hero
of the Namibian people,
Justremember that he di-
rectly participated in the
brutal killings and exter-
mination of my brothers
and sisters in Lubango
and Zambia.

We are still mourning
their deaths. Our parents
did not have the privi-
lege tobury their beloved
children and husbands.

I started this paper by saying Nujoma should go
and not have a third term. Why? The regime that I
have descnbed here is HIS. He is the President! He
has the power to change through dismissal, effec-
uve reshuffling of his cabinet, caforcemen of
policy, maintaining political serutiny of his politi-
cal employees (the Ministers, Deputies, PSs etc).
He had almost eight years to prove that he is not
only from Kahao, but from each part of the coun-
try. That instead of constructing a tarred road to his
own homestead, he coulc have constructed one to
Hosea Kutako's homestead as a gesture of revols-
tionary appreciation and unselfishmess. |: :

but if there 1s no peace, this nauon is doomed.
The government and the people of this country must
work hand-in-hand for acommon goal: rebuilding and
development of the land - and put their social, reli-
gious and cultural differences aside. The government
which was elected by the people and which has armies,
bombs and other killing materials should not abuse the
national patriotism to oppress, harrass and persecute

those holding different political opinions.

People musthelp the government and pay their taxes
and, as the recipient of these taxes, the government
must construct roads and allow loans for agricultural
development.

As a woman, I see peace as a birthday cake. It takes
a lot of ingredients: patience and love. Peace is not
created by one person. A refugee woman is the target
of rape, violence, harassment, prejudice and mostly
the offenders go free, unpunished and ready to repeat
their offences. There is no tangible ‘piece’ of peacc.
Peace must be whole and enjoyed by all the people of
the country. Peace is a woman who needs to be taken

care of. Welcome Peace.

__Swapo Has Lost Its Vision For Namibia

TO us young people of

this country during the

years of the 1960s and

1970s, Swapo sy mbolised
the mage of equality. jus
tice and freedom for all
the people of Namibia

The prevailing situation
then was one of oppres-
sion, denial of justice and
human rights for the
greater Majority of the
black and coloured popu
lation of our lund There
acre laws rastituted such
as job resers ations, Bantu

our people for generation

was boiling and an explo-

Swapo found much sup

For it “was a vision
where people of all col-

would take hands and
build a new Namibia, free

was a vision where we

farrly. Jt was a vision
where no one tnbe would

the others. It was also a
Nason where all
Namubians live in peace
and tranquillity, where no
Namibian would again be
a political refugee or flee
their homeland because of
politcal intimidation and
tear

It was because of this
common vision that the
support for Swapo was so
broad among the Nami-
bian people. It was be-
cause of this common vi-
sion that the support for
Swupo was unwavering.
For many it was a vision
for which they were pre-
pared to sacrifice their
fnends, family and posses-
sions.

For many others it was
a vision for which they
wese preparcd to lay
down their lives. For
many today, however, the

 . -_£.. ._._ i fh

shining vision of Swapo
has become a great disap-

Pointment. Vow muany Unies
vision thes shattered.

Why?

In simpke terms. Swapo
has for the past cight ycars
that it has been in poltucal
power in Namibia, done
nothing but emulate all the
evils of the past apartheid
regimes. Tt has instituted
one of the most corrupt
systems of self cnnchment
by political leaders and
their close friends and
relatives, [thad created an
elite system whereby a
small clique denves all the
benefits atthe detment of
the deprived. poverty
stncken population, [thas
insttuted tnbalism of the
most naked kind in the
civil service and
parastatals.

The Swapo-govern-
ment has squandered our
resources by the mishan-
dling of the national
budget as was again re-
cently pointed out by the
Auditor General. It is ap-
parent that the Swapo
government ts just not in-
terested in maintaining

any fiscal or monetary
discipline.

Vive de the renult of
competent and unquah
fied people being ap-
pointed to responsible
positions merely on the
basis of their ethnic and
tibal ongin. The govern
ment ts using legal means
to achieve illegal ends It
is thus clear that the ac-
tions of the present
Swapo leadership have
deviated drastically from
the capectauions of the
masses of our people

That brings us to the
crucial questions at us
juncture in our histors
WHAT IS TO BE
DONE?

That is the question that
was asked by Lenin when
Mother Russia laid: shut
tered because ot
maladministravon, cor
tuption, cthnte contlicts

question also has to be ane
swered by Nammbians al

* The Movement for

One may ask ‘but
what has this got to do
with Namibia?’ Well,
everything. Namibia got
its independence on the
morrow of the new
monopolar world domi-
nated by the USA. The
Western countries first
regarded themselves as
midwives of Namibia’s
independence, now they
have gone further and
granted themselves the
rights of a parent! They
forgot the Namibian
Goverment has a mind
of its own. Swapo set out
to create a Namibia en-
trrely in its own image
and to re- integrate it into
mother Africa

To top it all, Swape ts

that Westemers hate, and
vice versa

Posing homosexuality,

homosexuality 1s a fash-

* They started to be
vocally pro-Afnca.

* They started to
amend the Constitution

Germany Helmut Kohl

not have a written con-

* Worst of ali, Na-

sending troops to the

Mugabe.

WHY as it that fiberation movements, whenever they ing ground for lazy. unaccountable, non-transparent,
come into power over Afnca, tum out to be quite a

uademocratic, unresponsible, complacent : and ha
disappointment after a pernod of time?

Dunng the stroggle and after independence, the ex- 4
pectations of the masses run very high. Leaders are ¢
regarded as heroes who would deliver the long-awaited . extied
treedom and socio-economic uplifument.

* Now Namibia is op-

So Namibia must be
punished. But how?
There ts no economic

there 1s peace and stabil-

The Basters never took land or anything clse from
anybody in Namibia. The Rehoboth area where they
first settled was totally unoccupied and an open area
devoid of Nama or Hereros. Numencally it was also

1 AM a Kavanyo student
based in Windhock and
would like to express my
concern about the ongoing
banditry activities in my
region. I have seen that the
crists situation in the
Kavangois going from bad
to worsc.

Government's reaction
towards this problem ts a
complete nddle to me.
What is the use of just sit-
ting in luxurious offices,
peacefully and quietly,
while life is really a living
hell in the Kavango. The
Government should rather
find a solution to this mat-
ter, instead of just saying it
is the people of the
Kavango themselves who
are collaborating with
Unita.

Let’s come to a reason-

-able solution - instead of

wasting our tme on re-

aa _ ~

eruminauions against cach
other. This situauon where
Kavangos cannot even
enjoy the basic pleasure of
peace, progress, prosper-
ity and stability should not
conunue like this. [feel we
need the total deportation
ot the MPLA from Nami-
bian soil. Zambia has done
it, Why not Namibia too?
One thing the Govern-
ment should be aware of is
that Unita’s banditry ac-
vities are always onCNN
and this will discourage
More tounsts trom com-
ing to Namibia. So we will
lose anyway, as our coun-
try’s economy depends on
tounsm and this is reason
enough for foreign busi-
ness people not to invest
their shares in Namibia,
especially the Kavango.
Some of the schools in
the Kavango, like Max

Makushe Secondary
School, fans Shastipapa
and others won't have
physical science or math-
ematcs teachers. The yol-
unteer teachers won't be
interested in applying to
these schools due to the
unstable situation in the
Kavanyvo. In this way the
economy and academe
issucs will vradually be
aftected ;

So the Government
should not yust stand by.
must do someting - de-
mand the total withdrawal
of the MPLA trom the
Kavaneo

Unita bandutry activities
should not only be

Kavangoconcems, butthe

whole of Namibia as ‘one

Nanubia, one nation’.

During the election proceedings in

one judge was reported as saying the
US election 2000 fiasco was caused
by people who did not follow young
instructions. This can be an ambigu-
Ous or explicit statement, was it due
to the illiteracy of the voters or the
complication of ballot papers as al-
leged by the Democrats? Prom my

observation people are attributing it
to illiteracy.

According to that judge's state-
ment, it 1s Overt thal the voter's illit-
eracy impelled/incited the whole
election process/ballot counting to
be referred to the court for a verdict.
‘Toe same sentiments/ views were
also teverberated/repeated by our
Prime Minister when he addressed a
Swapo by-election rally at Rundu
this week and he said: “We know
how to count, we are not hke the

illiteracy again.

ALLOW me to clear up
and elaborate on what has

' become a controversial

hot potato on the name

, change for Capnvi.

Who was Caprivi to
start with? Caprivt was a
German Cuptain in the
German colonial army.
Shortly betore they were
defeated by the British
and the South Afmean
forees, Captain Capris
and his torces quickls
decided in that short ses-
sion held at then Head-
quarters: Schuckmianns

Caprivi in addition of the
existing Henge name

This was decided ta
have a two-fold connota-
tion. Firstly as a landmark
that Clearly states that the
entire Namibia was calo-
mised by Germany. See:
ondly. wath the name
Capri intact it was casy

for Germany to reclaim
the entire country back
after the war and review
allsigned agreements with
Britain.

A name change for
Caprivi is long overdue;
Was supposed to change
subsequently after rade-
pendenee in 1990.
Change is inevitable and
we cannotrun away from
It

Why the name change?

SThe scrambling of
Aftcan history teaches us

that most Afneans come
from the Great Lakes
where the name Capnvi
never existed, hence it
only came alive in 1915.
(Note: languages existed
before the name Capny1)

Bad Enough Without The Photo

THANK you for your services and for
“sull telling it hike it is"", despite some
people who only like you doing that
when it is in their favour. But today’s
front page (Wednesday January 30)
is beyond the limits of what we need to
know. In other words: the picture on
today’s front page is below your level
of journalism and nears your paper to
the low level The Windhoek Observer,
which I stopped buying when it pub-
lished the picture of the French chil-
dren that were murdered on the Caprivi-
Highway some years ago.
If I read in an article that a young man
killed his grandmother for N$SOO in

cash than this is bad enough. If I then
have to read that he used an axe, it is
more than enough. How should my
level of information be enhanced by
seeing the picture? Instead I would
rather like to know how a person can go
so far, better. how can a young person
lose his human and social values to
such an extent? What do the neigh-
bours and relatives say? How do they
think that they (and us) can prevent
such gruesome crimes in future?
Why are these kinds of crimes so much
increasing nowadays? How did people
deal with them traditionally? etc. It is
this kind of question I would rather be

interested in than seeing a dead kuku

with an axe in her head. Peace to her

soul. | am also concemed about the

feelings of the family of the victim and

the culpnt not to menuon all the other
people like desperate youngsters who
sec this picture. Why do they need to be
exposed to such atrocities? Do you
expect to sell more newspapers when
they have such pictures on the front
page? Please keep the quality level we
are used to from your paper and leave the
cheap and sensationalist journalism to
people who don’t know better.

When Headmen March On 4th Term

THE recent marching of Swapo kings and head-
men is a wrong move. It’s a pity that our people,
when they are in numbers sup the same
idea, think they are right. They think that means
“one Namibia, one nation”. What we must think
of is what the fourth term means for us as Namibian
nation, not to make one man happy. What is the
extent of its advantages and disadvantages? The
fourth term is costly. It will lead to more hunger
and poverty. Peace can never be maintained by an
individual human being, unless it is deserved by
all.

The demanded referendum is an additional
election. Where will the millions of dollars come
from? Will the nation be sacrificed again for an
individual advantage and benefit? Are we really
serious? To change the constitution to allow a
fourth term means money (millions). This burden
will be put on the already suffering Namibian
shoulders. Hearing the Government has

and hence we have a very limited inte; a sto the

The money will be misspent as we still have a
high unemployment rate in the country and those
in the recent youth service scheme from
Grootfontein could be employed. Or is it Swapo
party that will fund the referendum?

The extent of love within a human being is the
same as hatred. Chiluba in Zambia is an example
of the peoples’ turning point from love to hatred.
Next, the same people who are chanting. “We did
not sleep, we want Sem blah, blah”. They will
call for prosecution after they discovered the dis-
respect of our country’s constitution by him and
the misuse of our country’s limited resources for
individual benefit. Which reasons will they give
and what difference will they make between the
current President and his successor who will be
demanding a third and fourth term? He will also
be liked and supported by a majority like Netson
Mandela and Bil) Clinton. It is the same type of
people who will march again then.

correctly, in the 1990s we had what was
Called Operation Desert Seomm, the war
that was aimed at rag. Now again it
seems like we are again to see the second
pant of the operation, now being headed
by Bush Jr.

Bush Sr. headed the first part and now
we are again to see the other Bush tying
to continue where his father left off. Go-
ing to war_with Iraq will not be the
answer, it will only destabilize the peace
in the Muslim world. Is there any con-
crete proof that can implicate Saddam
Hussein in producing weapons of mass
destruction’ If there is not enough proof,
why is that the US is concerned with
going to war with Iraq?

I feel that we will pot be able to enjoy
peace even for one yeas, because the

Washington povemment will try to cre-
ate war whenever there is peace.
Is there not any single soluuon, which

can prevent the innocent people from
dying unnecessary deaths?

If the British government and the Wash-
can’t they try first to resolve the Middle‘
East crisis and then try to deal with Iraq?
What about the United Nations? Is not the
yob of the UN to see to i that no one can
be a threat to anyone? If we live in peace
and work for acommon goal, which 1s to
alleviate poverty and find the cure of
AIDS, wecan live better, instead of send-
ing millions of dollars in weapons, which
can destroy and kill people, we can use
that money to good use.

America will never get nd of its en-

towards some countries. Change will be

A Pain For The Youth

[ WILT. always be saluting the patron-
age of this widely read and informative
newspaper. The Nanubian newspaper
sull has the monopoly in terms of good
reporting both dunng the colonsal and
post colonial period - its still reporting
things as they are.

The aforementioned statement can-
not be defeated by any useful and re-
sponsible Nammbian citizen. The gov-
ermment does things without looking at
the mmpheations associated with its ac-
tions. One would always wonder 1f the
top government officials, including the
President, have advisors at all. Being

unemployed, we the youth of this nation
learnt with dismay of the government
ban from advertising inthe Namibran. It
Is very expensive for us Job seekers to
buy both the New Eraand The Namibran
at the same time. If the government 1s
shameful to come back to The Namibian
itmust establish a free of charge weekly
paper where we can get the govemment
job adverts. Otherwise there will be no
need to campaign for the next electcns
nor hark about peace and stahility.

Concerned Swapo Man
Windhoek

Right Wing Afrikaners, Take Note!

TREAD with shock and dismay in The Namibian of
November 12 about the activities of the so called
‘Boer nation warriors’. I want to express my views.

Ido not know whether the “boerevolk Krygers”
elements are also present in Namibia, but if there are
such members or those who are aspiring to such
ideas, keep such ideas dormant infinitely. It is
friendly advice.

I am very concerned about this terrorist move-
ment causing havoc tn South Africa with its result-
ant destruction and disregard for human life and
property. This movement, although it has been in
existence for years, has surely come at the wrong
time. Those conservative, radical boers must know
that they do not live in Utopia whereby theywant to”
promote the ideology of Aryan nationalism. They
must learn to live with diversity. We are all people
of different colours and that we have to live side by
side. No one ts superior or inferior to the other. To

be bad 1s not an inherent character, it ts a learned
habit due to the environment in which one is raised.
Anyone can be bad.

Criminality is not confined toa specific race. No!
Itis part of human existence and under certain social

circumstances and living conditions anyone is a

potential criminal.
This reminds me of what Mr Hannes Smith (edi-

tor of Windhoek Observer) once wrote. I quote. ‘No
man/woman ts born a criminal. Criminals are made
by conditions, environmental factors, to say noth-
ing of social conditions”. How true are those words
from an open-minded person.

Those who are aiming to wipe out the black nation
(in case of Soweto) must know that the black man
can act in the same way. Does it sound inciteful or
a threat (o you? Maybe, but not to me. Together we
can make or break this world.

Nine bombs in all were enough to take away many
innocent lives.

When one’s livelihood is threatened. you invent
ways to counteract in order to protect yourself to
survive. Let us live in peace rather than war. War ts
bad so let us avoid racial hatred since we did not
choose who we are. Let us find lasting pragmatic
solutions that would see us through to the next
development level. Life was meant to be lived by

all. No one has a patent on life.

WE read with shock and dismay the
artcle by the “brave” but nameless
‘Editorial staff members’ of Namibia
Today. This article is an unambiguous
declaranon of war by this newsletter
and I am ready to enter the battle
whatever the consequences.

The so-called wrong platform: The
Memonal service took place in the
Ephesians congregation of the Evan.
gelical Lutheran Church in the Repub-
lic of Namibia and for the information
of the ""Editorial staff members’ | am
the Bishop of that Church. Thus, I
used my own platform.

The late comrade Hilukilwa
Kandanga was a member of my
Church. She was not only a heroine,
but also a true Namibian who did not
only condemn tnbalism with her words

\

1 .

bot also very much with ber ows life.

Therefore, the timing of what I said
was correct, and within the right con-
text. It is also obvious that I woald not
ask permission from Namibia Today,
of anyone clse, for what I said on my
own platform!

My so-called attach on Swapo: At
no stage dunng my serman did I men-
uon the Swapo party or any tibe. I was
also not exclusive in what I said, but
very inclusive. I called on all of us, the
former oppressed Namibians, to also
look at ourselves and to correct whatis
wrong with us. The ‘editorial staff
members” accuse me of lies but they
are Shameless when they fabricate what
I did not say.

All three of us condemned tribalism
and cormupton in public and pot be-
hind closed doors “at the nght place,
and had it handled in line with the
culture and long established practice
of debate and mature discussions that
prevails in the Swapo party”.

Does this by implication mean that
the statements of the President and
Prime Minister on these issues are
outbursts and tibal antics and are also
regarded by Namibia Today as outra-
geous, despicable, and wild? This is
indeed the conclusion of all nght-think-

Happy About Fourth Term Cam

THE lingering debate and pos-
tunng by politcal pundits, tra-
ditional leadership, the ordi-

nary ciuzens and ‘outsiders’
about the need or not for Presi-
dent Nujomato run for another
term, the so called ‘Fourth
Term’ as Head of State, can be
likened to a rhinoceros, which
looks different depending on
where the observer is standing
and what portion of its anatomy
he/she 1s concentrating on.
Each perspecuve has some Par-
ucular insights andeachis only
a part of the whole!

As an ordinary Namibian
ciazen from the Caprivi Re-
gion, I am therefore delighted
to hear of yet another concerted
and well-orchestrated cam-
Paign to convince and/or urge
our President to seek another
term.

There 1s an American Say-
ing, “ifitain’tbroken, don't fix
10"". My position is simple and
gRoes something like thts: the
inconclusive leadership transt-
tion (no domestic pun intended
since mostof the senior leaders
in the Party and Government
are seasoned, tested and com-
Petent) that the recently held
Swapo Congress Produced,
raises important questions
about who will really be in
command should President
Nujoma step down after the
expiry of his current term.

While Iam a Breat believer
In ‘collective leadership’ (it’s
casy if you are one of the cho-
sen ones), I suppose I’ve be-
come disillusioned with poli-
tics - and I think most
Namibians have become disil-
lusioned with poliucians too.

An intellectual friend of
mine once commented,
“Namibians don't want to ac.
cepl excuses any more - if
there’s moncy tobe stolen, why
isn’t there money for the peo-
ple?” It would appear we sull
don't have our pnorities nghte.

Once upon a time I was al-
ways fixing everyone else's
problems, but not my own and
guess where it landed me?
What has all this to do with the
Fourth Term, you may ask?

Despite a mosaic of tnbula-
uons and misplaced pnonities,
every day I ask the question:
‘Can President Sam Nujoma
do no wrong?” The answer is
an emphatic NO.

Namibians love him above
all other Ministers and even
the feeble and weak Opposi-
tion grudgingly admires his

Poltucal talent. At his age,
President Nuyoma has lostnone
of his charisma he had in exile
and ts a man of al} Seasons
liked by all Namuibians from
any comer of this great nation
of ours.

Perhaps the Breatest asset
credited to President Nuyoma
IS ZOOd governance.

Since independence on 21
March 1990 delivered high lev-
els of security, provided qual-
ity educaton and health serv.
Ices, respected political
freedoms and human nghts,
framed a strong rule of law,
bolstered an economic frame-
work conducive to growth and
has provided an environment
in which civil society can flour-
ish.

Hence, there 1s a direct cor-
relauon between good national

bovernance and economic
Prospenty

Ordinary Namibians havea
mght to expect a better life af-
ter all the sacnfices they en-
dured during the liberation
struggle. People do not fight
for ideas but for peace, mate-
nal benefits anda better future
for their children.

The majority of Namibians’
€xpectauons of independence,
namely, their sincere hope that
freedom from colonial Tule
would usher in a new era of
basic rights and freedoms long
denied by settler rule. This 1s
What the liberation struggle
meant for ordinary Namibians.
President Sam Nujomais there-
fore an embodiment of the
aforementioned ideals.

The big question for Pres-
dent Nujyoma, therefore, is not

paign

as much opposition from ann-
chair critics from the West,
amateur poliucians of ‘op
SIUON parties’ but the envy of
his own colleagues, some of
whom have bowed out due to
their politcal naivete.

President Nuyoma has one
Tule he says something each
day and in such a manner that
it becomes the talk of the na-
tion He 1s therefore in the Spor-
light most of the ume - all of
which impresses the Namibian
voters and makes his fellow
politicians seethe with jeal-
ousy

How detilitaung then tocnt-

How To Ta

FOR hope to have an
it must be founded on Teality, on
truth. False hopes only blinds
People to reality. Therefore, we
need to ask: do we appreciate just
how big the problems are that
must be solved to bring genuine
Peace and security? Do we real-
ise how urgent the situation has
become? Is there any evidence
that human solutions would be
equal to the immensity of the
task? For thousands of years men
have sought lasung peace and
secunty on earth, without suc-
cess. But now the situation is most
urgent because of the threat of
war between nations, ethnic tribes,
religions and families. In addi-
ton, other threats imperil life on
earth. One is the world wide pol-

y Meaning,

lution of land, air and water. An-
other is population explosion with
Its associated hunger and disease
such as AIDS. Regarding the pro-
found crisis pervading almost all
spheres of human activity: eco-
nomic and social, political and
military, spintual and moral, vio-
lence is on the increase and the use
of force as an instrument of policy
and diplomacy has become wide-
spread, the balance between peace
and war has become even more
precanous. Where is this leading?
The United Nations wamed: “We
are penlously near to a new inter-
nabonal anarchy “.

Is there any reason to believe
that men can bring an end to war?
Histoncally, there have been only
a few scattered years when this

carth was totally free from

war. In the 20th century alone,
about 100 million people have
been killed in war, neither yester-
day’s League of Nations Nor to-
day’s United Nations has been
able to stop this slaughter. But
won't the fear of nuclear weap-
ons change this? Wasn't suffi-
cient fear of nuclear weapons
aroused back in 1945 when atom
bombs annihilated two Japanese
clues? Since then stockpiles of
vastly more powerful nuclear
weapons have grown a thousand-
fold. And since 1945 many. many
people have been killed in wars
and rebellions involving more
than 100 countnes.

In recent years more than 45
nauons were involved in con-

flicts, no fear of nuclear weap-
ons has and wi] ttop the war.

to sign disarmament pacts or trea.
ves. Over the century Isterally
more then thousands of these
have been signed Yet, when-
Cver war sentiments became
strong enough. those meanes be-
come worthless scraps of paper
The United Nations has also
failed to stop war, because al-
though nearly all the counties
today are part of the UN, they
ignore tat will So we hope that
future world leaders will keep
their word more than they have
done in the past

ngEL4I485ELM5FVArEN27NLdIEdTuMrJTEMo5ILA,"‘Batfy’ Gets A Bashing

ALL I can say is thank God The
Namubian didn’t accept Batfour
Ankomah’s challenge to reprint
his entire lecture in full. Pm allin
favour of fantasy fiction but after
reading Baffour’s lengthy,
obscenely self satistied and
patronisingly racist letter in The
Namibian (not to mention
watching him in person blathering
away on Talk of the Nation), Pd
have to say that Namibia has
suffered enough,

Begone, Batfour! Go back to
your cruel exile in) your
comfortable London flat with its
potholed road (not to mention
fancy restaurants, political
security and snappy boutiques)!

Or better sal, if you think that
potholes are a serious indictment

of Western values, cut the poor
British some slack, hop ona plane
and leave them 1n peace as well.

Take your mercenary little rag
of a magazine with you. Open a
newspaper office in Zimbabwe,
perhaps.

I hear there’s one currently
vacant in Harare and you've got
the Zanu-PF government line
down pat. Lassume thatMugabe’s
people pay you. Or at the very
least fly you around showering
you with free hotel rooms and
bodyguards. Baffy, my little
exiled buddy, tell me I’m wrong!
Can't. Can you?

One final suggestion.

How about returning to your
native Ghana? You can’t still be
inexile surely? Not after all these

years? Not when you love Africa
so much and know so much about
this great continent. Not after all
the political change that has taken
place in Ghana? And you, Batfy,
stl in exile?

Or perhaps you are. Given your
morbidly turgid prose, your
depressing dictatorial arrogance,
your inability to write a simple
letter without giving a moderate
newspaper reader (me) dyspepsia,
and the sheer lunacy of your stance
onissues suchas HIV-AIDS, how
wonderful it ts to live under
Mugabe, and the evils of press
freedom, perhaps you are.

Yes, perhaps you are.

] WOULD like to publicly
thank NBC Radio in your
popular newspaper and
fearless news disseminator.
On Sunday morning, (7
March 2004) I was
surprised and excited to
hear an American Voice of
Islam, coming out ot NBC
radio. That was between
8h30 to 9h30. The program
was basically focussed on
the “Importance of
Conscience” in bringing
about God-consciousness,
when adhered to properly
by any criucal and nght-
thinking human beine.
The presenter, whospoke
with an American accent,
was talking about the
similarities between certain
Biblical and Quranic

statements on the issue of

conscience and God-
consciousness. AS oa
Namibian Muslim, [ was
naturally happy to hear our
national radio broadcasting

an Islamic message,
moderately, wisely and
scientifically presented. All
I wantto say ts: Thank you
very much NBC Radio!
On behalf of the Muslim
community in Namibia, |
would like tosay, you made
us feel athome and at peace
by broadcasting the etemal
Message of all God's
Prophets over our national
airwaves. For me it was the
first ume I listened to such
a program. It was, indeed,

enlightening, though, Pwas —

already famihar with the
contents. Continue
educating and informing
the nation, without fear or
favour. Proud of you, NBC
Radio and Lam happy to be
Namibian and Muslim!
Thank vou once again!

Speeches, Please!

NAMIBIAN voters havea right to be informed inorder
to cast their votes with commitment and maturity as
far as their future is concerned. [tis in that context that
we - again - request “leaders” to stick to the rules of
democracy and free and fair elections.

Mr. Tyirtange, your previous position as Minister of
Justice should have instilled a respect for the Namibian
Constitution in you. That should at least reach as far as
knowing that it is NOT SWAPO that created the
Namibian Defence Force, Police, Civil Service etc. etc.
- that is an obligation every Government of a country
has.

Swapo is just another political party and not the
Government. Sic - we do not live in 1960 anymore - the
year 2044 1s here and we have and want to move on.

We all have an understanding that you might still
fee! bitter about your past - let us, however, look ahead
and rather work for a future that does not bring back
those years. Namibia has so many problems that need
tangible solutions. Solutions will not be found by clinging
on to the past and asking weird questions hke: “What
did Ben Ulenga tell the Boers to be released?”

Absurd statements like “the CoD has been created
by colontalists”.

By the way, Sir, the CoD is a legitimate political
party and not an organisation. You can condemn the
“colonisers” till eternity - as fong as you, the Swapo
party, still depend on them for food assistance for
Namibians your statements boomerang.

Tell the voters why is it necessary to apply for N$37.7
million donor assistance to feed Namibians?

Teli the voters why only foreigners get major building
contracts these days?

Tell the voters why they - after 14 years of
mdependence - stul live in shacks and shambles?

Why is almost every municipality bankrupt in
Nambia? .

Why is each and every parastatal costing the
Namibian taxpayers milhons and millions?

Sir -yvouas former Minister of Justice - should cry out
loud: babies and toddlers are raped on a daily basis.
Criminals rule the country - Namibtans get murdered
for a few dollars - corruption never gets punished.

The hist, Lam afraid, is endless! The Police force ts ill
equipped. ill-trained - why would Windhock otherwise
ask for a Municipal Police Force?

The Namibian Defence Force - whois insane enough
to want to attack Namibia - Nambia does not need that
Force. The money could be spent on housing/educations
health services etc. etc. All these and many more
pressing issues and what can be done about it.

That makes up election material for many months —
Sir-notyour defamations and agitating hate speeches.

Howeser-af your attacks on the CoD are an indicator
to vo by - the Cob is doing a good job and giving you
ample reason to see an opposition in that party,

Mr Tjitianye, please come up with solutions for
Namibians since we all Know that the tax pavers — and
thatincludes opposition party members - pay for Swapo
rallies

We have peace in Namibia - thatis also a credit Co
opposition partes since we can argue in parliament
and don't hase to take up weapons - lets keep it that
way. please. and let's tackle Namibia's multuple
problems toxether.

Create a plattorm for FREE and FAIR elections.

ALLOW me some space, please.
to remind some of your readers
that before they write about any
conflict around the globe and the
people involved init, todo some
research first on particular mat-
ters and to have a more realistic
approach.

A letter ta The Namibian
- ‘Condemn the Killers” - 1s an
example where the writer show s
his total ignorance about the
situation inthe Middle Eastand
Us people

The writer claims that Pales-
tinians are forergners inthe Hols
Land and should be expelled by
the Israclis in order to achieve
everlasting peace, He also writes
that Palestinians are not men-
uoned in Phe Bible or recorded
bs historians. In the letter he
cniucised European Union gov -
eramems for condemning the
ussassinauon of Hamas leader
Yassin by Psraclis.

This isn’t the place for me
to write about the 10 000-year
long history of these (vo great
nations which contributed so
much to world cultures in terms
of many discoveries, writings

and science. My sole objective
1s LO COrrecl MIspercepuions on
this particular issue

The fact is that the Arabs
and the Jews believe that they
descend from the same father
- Abraham. No-one is sure who
came firsttothe Holy Land His-
tory only tells us that Palestine
was first peopled by wandering
Stone Age hunters and that per-
manent agricultural settlement
appeared at Jericho about 8000
B.C) According to historical
claims Hebrew (Jews) tribes
arrived from the desert in Pales-
tine between the [4th and }2th
century BoC.and that roughly
the sume time the Philistines
invaded trom the sea,

The name Palestine is in fact
anadaptation troma Greek word
“the land of Philistines” and the
name ismentioned many times in
The Bible. First Book Gen 21:34
“Abraham lived in Philestia for
along me”.

Just for the record | would
like to mention that in 1918 the
Palestine population consisted
of 500 000 Muslim Arabs, 100
000 Arab Christians and 60 000

Jews.

At the time of the 1948 war,
more than 500 000 Palestinians
fled from their country to seck
refuge with Arab neighbours tn
every Arab country where thes
landed, they were treated as
second-class citizens, confined
to ghettos specially created for
them

Why EU governments con-
demn the killing of Hamas
leader Mr Yassinis because thes
believe that the assassination of
political leaders promotes more
violence and does not provide
a solution for either sides. Not
long ago, Swapo was just like
Hamas, on American terrorist
lists,andevervbody wouldugzree
with me that assussmation of its
President, Sam Nujoma, by the
former South African whtte re-
gime, would only have destroy ed
the relauionstip between blacks
and whttes and caused more ha-
tred; but would ulmately never
have prevented Namibia from
becoming independent

ELECTIONS would be fairif those who vote elected
their representatives freely without any pressure or
any form of intimidation or character assassination?
I strongly feel that (the Swapo Congress) elections
were not free and fair.

The sacking ofoursistonary, capable Hamutenya
just before elections and smear campatens against
him by Nujoma on several occasions will never
make this election free and fair.

I would notexpect any rational person to belies ¢
what has been said about Hamutenya by those who
did so, including the President.

We expected the President to tell the natlon and
the Congress in particular that these are tested
comrades and the every body should make his/her
own choice accordingly.

He ts now claiming that the Congress has voted
in the interest of the whole nation. This ts totally
wrong. The congress has voted for Nujoma’s un-
Known interests.

If the entire nation was afforded a chance to
elect, | think the results could have been different.
The fact that Pohamba came with a pre-prepared
speech for the victory shows us that the results
were predetermined and the transparency used in
the counting processes is questionable.

We considered Sam Nujyomaas the greatfounding
father of our natron and indeed a visionary leader

of Africa but this was not so. Nujoma ts increas-
inely becoming a hardcore despot. He thinks he can
turn things around, ceteris paribus. Firing senior
ministers and indeed cabinet members who served
for decades ts a big embarrassment to him and to
the public.

Does this mean Swapo party does not have iter
nal disciplinary procedures to deal with unfounded
defaming allegations’? He keeps on referring to
others as imperiatists and forgets that he went to
the same imperialists to negotiate for Namibia's
independence.

His prerogative is beigg seriously misused. Some
ministers are so much preferred that firing them
would destabilise the country’s peace and stabilits
and dissolve the gains of our hard-won mdepend-
ence. This is also a sign that Swapo ts slowly but
surely disintegrating.

I think this was the wrong decision at the wrong
time. All the peace loving Namibians (perhaps ex-
cluding despots, opportunists, presidential remote

PROMPTED by the publication of
“instances of hate speech” by the National
Societ) of Human Rights tin our media
allow me to pass some comments, and
e\press my personal opinion on this very
SCTIOUS Issue.

} don’t think it would be necessary to
write or explain more about the grave
consequences of hate speech. Its all
well Known and documented in places
like Bosnia tthe country of my births and
Rwanda

Phave to mention that for many vears |
used to live under to, which Pwould call
“evil systems). being communism and
apartheid respectively,

Howeveresil the 40 were. none of the
two allowed hate speech to be directed
towards other nationalities orraces: Under

the communists, hate speech even heavily
puntshable by the law.

Here in Namibia where the building of
“one Namibia one Nation” and reconcill-
ation should be the priorities for the sake
of peace and stability.

We have destructive clements amony
the democratically elected publie figures,
like some government officials and upton
leaders. who ure by their speeches finding
it very difficull to connect ther mouths
with their brains

What makes matters even worse. (heir
speeches are broadcasted, over and over,
momost of our spoken languages

Even winning by 99% OF votes, no
government can cham: for ttself to be
transparent and democratic it it allows
the nghts of minorities to be disrespected

and violated.

However, NBC and other instigators of
racial hatred in our society didn tachieve
anything so far and hopetully this will be
so in the future Tas a white Namibian,

IHOPEthistime my letter will ap-
pear, unlike the other vo or three
cases When you (unintentionally )
omitted them. Ewill copy itto the
other media, Just in Case.

I read the rather confusing, tf
not uninformed, opinion of Nadia
Ihuhua, where she was dissatis-
fied with Uutont Nujoma’s pres-
entation to the CHR in Geneva,
regarding the case of the Caprivi
secessionists.

Well, Nadia. like any other
Namubian, you have a right to air
your opinton as you did, so let me
do the same as follows:

How informed are you if you
label Cde. Paulus Kapia as one
of the “government officials”?
When last we checked Cde. Ka-
pia was a Party official. Nadia
rightly alluded to the need for us
to have “responsible and trans-
parent leaders who know what
isiMportantand what constitutes

human-centred

development” She ts right but
which humans are being referred
to? Tome. only leaders to the con-
trary will allow sucha vision to be
derailed by a tew elements

such as Muyongo and his
cohorts.

After all when we talk of hu-
man-centered development dont
we mean the people with a sense
of purpose, thatof sustainable de-
velopment, like the ones we have?
Or, Dowe mean the detractors, Ms
Ihuhua? Surely we do not mean
to spend all the scant resources
on the rights of the detractors
rather than on the pensions of our
elderly or HIV-AIDs patients?
Do you really think if we spend
millions of $ this case, we will
elevate our human rights record
internationally?

What about the right to five in
peace, the right to food. the right

live without fear ete? What Kind
of agenda do Vou sant to set for
US. Mnocent ciaizens?

Thenagain, since vou are Inv it
ing people to go to the launching
of the NSHR Report, then | guess
I(andevervone else} know where
you are coming from. Good luck
with thatevent, but for the rest of
us, We prefer democracy, which
is the government by the people
(majority ) for the people, and of
the people.

Ifyou really have the future of
our country at heart, please stop
bering phony and be a Namibian
The few people you are talking
about want their own country.

They will have therrfairchance
under our laws. The question is,
are they with Republic of Namibia
or with their dream Republic?

I would tke to start
with giving my advice and
Views to our democrau-
cally elected representa-
lives those are voting to
be nominated and those
who are representing us
now, more especially
members of parhament
(National Assembly and
National Council). Some
of our representatives do
not truly represent us.
because we, cilizens often

do not nomunate them in
the urst place. They are
representing thetr respec-
tive political party leader-
ship. Representatives who
have been sonominated by
their leaders, once elected
to office as parhamen-
tarians and councillors,
become subservient to
these leaders. Instead of
this representative being
accountable to the voters
they are only responsible
and accountable to their
political leaders who nom-
mated them. and who also
have the power lo remove

them. Therefore such
representauves Strive to
please their leaders often
iN patron-chent relation:
ships. Such relationships
are often maintained atthe
expense of the voters and
the general public. This ts
why once in their office,
most parliamentarians
and councillors may not
do what the public expects
them to do.

I know that these rep-
resentauves are not really
representing us because
cilizens are not the ones
who nominate them,

awe AlCl Ss Oe a Law

What! want toemphasis
is that: P can see that the
top-down appointment
of candidates is not a
vood way to go. Voters

have to nominate their

own representatives. Such
representauves nominated
by the voters themselves
know the needs of citi-
gens better than imposed
candidates do. Voters also
nominate a person who
they know and who they
trust. This system of the
top-down tashion of nomi-

I WOULD like to address this letter
to both Enok and SWABC.-TV.

Tam doing this because both these
corporations are competing with the
private sector while at thesametime
they enjoy the taxpayer's financial
security.

Both Radio and TV are competing
with private sector advertising
media. Why should they take the
money which rightfully belongs to
the newspapers?

Secondly, why should Enok, the
development corporation, have to
compete with the private sector in
things like wholesalers and garages,
butcheries and so on? There are
many Namibian businessmen who
are capable of running such
businesses.

Instead Enok should be concen-
trating on building factories that will
produce commodities which are
presently imported from South
Africa. This country has no fac-

Corporations compete with private sector

tories, most items are bought from
South Africa. If the Corporation
would start building factories there
would be more yob opportunities in
Our country and things could be
manufactured here. In this way,
things would cost less, and the slogan
‘Investin Namibia, Buyin Namibia’
would become a reality.

Isn't it the job of the interim
government Cabinet to pass such a
bill, instead of a billon stock theft?
Why should the Cabinet evade the
real issues? The label, ‘Made in
Namibia’, should become a fact.

Why does the Cabinet make the
theft of diamonds acrime and yet let
CDM drain the country of diamonds
atthe same time? Rossing, TCL and
Other mining companies are doing
the same.

Why can Namibian towns be built
up like Johannesburg? If the wealth
of Namibia was evenly distributed,
the poorest man in the country

should be living ina house like those
in Arandis.

What 1s the problem with the
‘Cabinet’? Are you really ministers
or just socalled? Our country is be-
ing bled, do something now for
tomorrow may be too late.

Remember: minerals don't breed.

IN THE LIGHT of the fact that our
Coloured schools have been in the
news jately, I have a number of
questions.

Myself and other parents looked
forward to secing what the pass
percentages were of matriculants last
year. Now | must read in a local
newspaper that, according to the Ad-
ministration for Coloureds, these
figures are a secret. How onearthcan
the percentage passes be kept a
secret?

As a Coloured taxpayer, I appeal
to Mr Billy Phillips, Chairman ofthe
Executive Committee and member
charged with Education, to make
known this figure, as well as that of
the Standard Eights for last year.

Recently there have also been
many reports that the Coloured
schools in Khomasdal are full and
that hundreds of students are sent
home. According to Mr Koopman,
Director of Education, the situation
is to be ascribed to the following:

* many parents have moved from
rural areas to Windhoek

* parents whose children-were last
year in South Africa, are now at
schools in Windhoek

* Coloureds in South Afnca, who
by virtue of present conditions there,
send their children to Windhoek
schools.

These reasons are correct, but Mr
Koopman forgot to mention the
mostimportant one, namely the fact
that children from Katutura are
streaming into Khomasdal schools.

{am notasupporter of apartheid.
not in the least. ] am saving these
things in the light of the apartheid
kingdom (AG 8) which the Labour
Party of Mr Dawid Bezuidenhout
and Mr Billy Phillips and company,
accepted, and according to which
they govern.

If people accept acertain govern:
ment system, then they should
govern according to the letter and
spirit of it, and not mercly in accor-

ON OS at Be ee

dance with those parts which suit
them.

In accordance with Proclamation
AG 8, the personal tax of each tax-
payer is paid to the second tier
authority of the population group of
which he is a member. A certain por-
tion of that tax is used for education.
| am sure that the greatest percentage
of the Coloured budget 1s spent on
education. In other words, the bulk
of the taxpayer’s money is spent on
education.

In the fight of this, Mr Phillips
should reply immediately to the
following questions:

* Why are hundreds of black
children allowed in our schools,
while our own children are sent
home?

* Do the parents of black children
pay taxes to the Coloured
Administration?

If the answer is yes, then I would
like to know what these parents pay.

Once again I wish to say that | am

strongly opposed to any form of
apartheid but I want toprovethat AG
8, which Mr Phillips and Company
accepted, is not implementable, and
our concern is because our children
are losing out educationally.

In a radio interview, Mr Burden,
Rector of the Khomasdal training
college, said that 40 percent fewer
students had been accepted at the
College this year. 1 further hear that
most of the students come from
South Africa and other ethnic
groups.

}call upon Mr Phillips to give us
these figures too. How many
students are from South Africa and
other ethnic groups? ThenI wantto
know the costs of running the Col-
lege per annum.

Mr Phillips must also tell us why
it is necessary to have an apartheid
coliege near to the Academy? Is ita
question of his imitating his white
apartheid brothers?

Year after year we must hear how

m a Khomasdal taxpayer

teachers are imparted from South
Africa and placed in senior posts,
while our own teachers with equal or
higher quatifications are overlook-
ed. With respect to the ‘imported’
teachers, I must say that some of
them are the weakest teachers, who
have said they could not get jobs in
South Africa, but here they are given
senior posts.

I want 10 ask Mr Phillips why he
has made our schools, the rubbish
heap of South African teachers?

The only way out of this govern-
ment system (AG 8), which is accep-
table tono one but the leaders of the
Coloured Labour Party, is to scrap it
in its totality. Let the true political
leaders, and not the ‘yes-boss’ types
and political opportunists, work out
a system which is acceptable to the
people of this country.

The fact that the South Afnean

Nonetheless, Mr Katyiuongua sees

PEOPLE In Karirib are faced with
a serious problem and people in
Namibia should become aware of it.

As weall know, iob opportunities

capitalists to force unemployed to

We are not ignorant and are not

forefathers did.

In Karirib, many young men and
women are wandering around
jobless. Some of these stay at the
homes of their parents, and are forc-
ed to pay what we call Kopteks (rent)
which had already been paid by their
parents. Dog taxes are payable and if
one does not pay for his dog, he is
afraid the dog will be shot.

Sanitary conditions in the black
town are bad, and there are no taps
inthe houses, and only some of them
have electricity. Only those who

to pay for the use of it, .

ngAH4E081BHI1BRqnAT80JHTEAzPqInFPBIk1EHq,"Colonel Eimbeck reacts to opinions of Pastor Kameeta

YOU HAVE GIVEN Vice Bishop
Kameeta space in your newspaper to
voice his opinion. I request thesame
opportunity since you call yourself
achampion for freedom of specch.

Mr Kameeta claims that the in-
dependence of Namibia is an in-
alienableright, and that it isdemand-
ed without conditions attached. He
isright, but why does he, and his par-
ty, Swapo, refuse to acknowledge any
other political opinion in this de-
mand for independence?

Why doesn't Mr Kameeta use his
high office to ensure justice, peace
and freedom for every Namibian?
He is aware of the fact that Swapo
does not tolerate opposition. He
knows that everybody opposing
Swapo will be subject to arbitrary
punishment or even execution
without a fair trial. Mr Kameeta
should support the call made by The
Namibian on Swapo toensurea fair
hearing for those who are accused of
being spies for South Africa.

Mc Kameeta should be aware of
the fact that many political parties in
Nainibia have urged Swapoto be an
equal partner in their opposition to
South Africa. He should also know
that Swapo refuses to drop the adjec-

tive ‘sole and authentic represen.
tative of the people of Namibia’. Ms
Lister should inform Mr Kameeta of
what her experiences are concerning
this imposed status on Swapo. Mr
Kameeta, who has vowed to preach
love, peace and righteousness,
should bein the front to ensure that
every Namibia be granted the right
and the opportunity to work towards
independence of this country,

Mr Kameeta knows that Swapo
regards violence as the only viable
means of attaining independence tor
Namibia, but does he consider the
fact that the majority people inthis
country are peaceloving Christians
and thus prefer a negotiated
setdement?

Mr Kamecta calls for boycotts and
disinvestment and calls the potential
suffering of the majority of people
‘empty phrases’. Simultaneously this
Vice Bishop demands that ‘all peo-
ple must have the right to decent
housing, and bring up their famulics
incomfort and secunty. Free medical
care and hospitalisation must be pro-
vided for all, with special care for
senior citizens, mothers and small
children. The aged and disabled must
be fully cared for by the State’.

Has it occurred to Mr Kameeta
that toreign investment is vital to
achieve these aims? Mr Kameeta 1s
fully aware of the fact that Swapo
and the CCN regularly call on inter-
national financial support to
alleviate the plight of the people.
Why then should only his party and
Ws followers benefit from financial
aid and not the majority of the
people?

Will Mr Kameeta care to tell the
public how much he earns and how
much he pays in taxes? Will Mr
Kaniceta be prepared Co inform the
people ot this country about the
lnfestyde of those who profess to fight
tor independence and lberation
about their contribution towards the
alleviation of the suffering people in
the form of finangial contributions?

Can Mr Kamectainform the publicol

what he proposes should be dane to
obtain sufficient funds to attain what
all the people in Namibia desire?
Mr contention as that Swapo ts
guilty of the most atrocious
discrimination against people. Mr
Kameeta 1s actively engaged in
Swapo's political activities, this
makes him guilty of discriminating
aguinst his own people too. Accor-

ding to the Oxford dictionary,
discrimination means to ‘make a
distinction, to give unfair treatment,
especially because of prejudice’.
Swapo and Mr Kameeta call
everybody who does not compty with
their conditions and with their opi-
mons, collaborators, traitors, pup-
pets etc. Everybody who dares to
speak against Swapo is threatened
and intimidated. Every person who
docs not support Swapo is being
discriminated against. This 1s
definitely not what the majority of
Namibians willsupport, thisis what
the majoruyof the Namibians want
eradicated,

Mr Kameeta claims his fame and
right to speak about pohtical matters
on his arrestand detention. For any
law-abiding citizen, especaally for
devoted Christians, defiance of the
law isdetestable. If Mr Kamectaasa
Vice Bishop and even more as a
Swapo politician, was really con-
cerned about the welfare of the peo-
ple of this country and their in-
ahenable right to self-determunation,
he would have made positive con-
tributions and would not support an
organisation which sees only
violence as a means of achieving

whal they desire, namely, to take over
power of this country.

Mr Nujoma has declared more
than once that Swapo is not in-
terested in powersharing, but only in
power itself, During his recent pro-
paganda tour for Swapoin West Ger-
many, Mr Kameeta has proven that
he is against any form of opposition
to Swapo and that he disputes the
right of ficedom of speech of a Ger-
man citizen in his own country. With
this act added to his political antics
against the people of thiscountry, Mr
Kameeta has disqualified himself of
claiming to be i champion for
freedom, Justice and peace.

Dear Mr Cleary

YOU too have done some ‘remarkable’
pieces of writing, most recently in
Leadership (Volume $ 1986 Number 2),
in which you measure the success of ihe
interim government by means of the
vague generaltsation of ‘inclusivity’.
This ‘government’, you say, seeks to in-
volve all parties and also to draw to
these same parties, the support
previously enjoyed by those outside it.

May we remind you that there are six
parties (some in name only) which en-
joy membership of the interim govern-
ment. Membership of ‘other parties’,
however minor their support, who have
shown interest in the interim govern-
ment, has been turned down, and I refer
in particular to the recent HNP request
for membership of the ‘Constitutional
Council’.

‘Inclusivity’, therefore, hardly seems
to be the goal of this interim
government,

You have not explained why the DTA
prefers to operate outside your con-
sultancy service, and it has been wide-
ly reported (not only in The Namibian)
that there has been a breakdown in
communication between yourself and
Mr Dirk Mudge, an interim government
miniMer you claim to represent,

What is perhaps of note, is your
— geference to the ‘Transitional Govern-

| ment’, rather than the ‘Government of

National Unity’, Even you can no-

longer claim that there is “unity” in their
ranks, any more than you can claim that
there is ‘consensus’ on the question of
AG 86 despite socalled mnanimnous

resolutions concerning the removal of —

ethnic and racial discrimination.

therefore inextricably linked to the
mine. It is also not an exaggeration to
assert that without the Namibian
migrant workers, the town in question
would not have been established

what it is. The settlers are not
celebrating the birth of the town of

WE, 1
- Gebiet, have kept a close eye on the
maelstrom politics of the Basters
recently, and we are sick and tired
to this underhand, directionless
politicking over our heads - we
challenge the Basters to direct
negotiate with us.

We wish to inform the Baster
government that we have serious
reservations about the statements in
recent weeks.

Firstly, about the socalled ‘open
schools’. In spite of the Baster
government's eelf-expressed policy
that all schools in the Gebiet are open
to all regardless of race or colour, it
is not the Baster children who are be-
ing driven out of these ‘open schools’
- at a time when the whole of
Namibia is striving for open schools.

Money from Baster taxpayers. We
would like to know which Baster tax
payments are spent on what purpose

for the black people of Rehoboth. For
virtually every need, such as the
moving of black people, they got
money from the central government,
but instead used it for the develop.
ment of the Basters and in so doing,
perpetrating the squatter status of
the black people in the area.

On the question of the presence of
black people in this Gebiet, which is

wrongly understood, | would like to
say the following: we are in this
Gebjet to stay, forever. It is our right
to be here, it ia not a favour from the

of anyone else. The Basters

once again take note that the
present Rehoboth history is being
written by the Bastera for the

Basters, and is not recognised y US. .
, Basters should also take note that.

‘we first requested fair and

THE black people of Rehoboth —

for each black resident of this area,
in order to ‘squat’ legally in these
places, but we are no longer in-
terested in a few hectares: we want
the land of our forefathers.

The socalled support of the black
people. We would like to see the
Baster government hold a meeting in
Block E in order to establish what
the black people think of them.

The referendum. Like other Nami-
bians, we look forward to the result
of the proposed referendum, because
in this manner we wil] get a clear pic-
ture of where the Basters stand in
regard to the rest of Namibia. We ex-
pect the whole world to keep an eagle
eye on the proposed referendum.

The Basters of this country must
take note that any law applied in the
Rehoboth Gebiet, must be announc-
ed at a policy meeting, where they
establish what policy should be
followed and that everyone is guilty
of the socalled vaderlike wette and at-
tention 18 given to the official oppres-
sion of the Basters, under which the
black people suffer.

‘With the proposed referendum
each Baster wil! be asked what his
attitude is towards the other in-
habitants of this country.

One thing is certain - as certain as
the sun which rises in the east - an
election will come in this country,
and the Basters will want to
negotiate.

THE CONSPIRATORIAL and pro-

ACCORDING to a report published
in the Republikein of March 6 1987,
interim government Minister, An.
dreas Shipanga, ‘sharply criticised’
and expressed his ‘disappointment’
about certain statementa the Vicar
General of the Roman Catholic
Church, Father Bernhard Nor-
dkamp, had allegedly made during
an address given at a youth seminar,
which, again according to the report,
is said to have been organised by the
Council of Churches. The report
relates to what Mr Shipanga 1s alleg.
ed to have said during a meeting of

the National Assembly on March 5

1987.

Mr Shipanga, according to the
report, bases his claim about what

the Vicar General had said during

the youth seminar held at Dobra, on

a letter by an unidentified “Win-

~ dhoek student'’ which letter was
- published in the Windhoek Observer

of February 28, 1987. The “student”
alleges, inter alia, that Father Nor-

- dkamp had said that “law and order
are sin”. For the purposes of this

statement it is sufficient to state that
the letter contains further very
serious distortions and outright un-
truths. It represents nothing but a
very ill-considered attempt to amear
the Roman Catholic Church and to
discredit the Vicar General, whose
commitment to bringing about
justice with peace in a truly Chris-
tian society in Namibia is well

| known

Against this background, Mr
Shipanga's criticism ie evidently un-

| warranted and uncalled for. Yet Mr

Shipanga, who holds hia high office
by virtue of an appointment by the
Routh African Government, sean fit

to simply repeat these untrue allege:
tions of what the Vicar General is

taken to have said, relying on
nothing more than an anonymous |

Cabinet minister can simply accept
serious allegations without further
verification. Mr Shipanga’s failure to
check his facta is even more frighten-
ing in view of the extremely wide ar-
bitrary executive powers which are
vested in him. and his colleagues in
the Cabinet of the interim govern-
ment by virtue of numerous socall-
ed security laws, which would clear-
ly require the greatest measure of —
restraint and responsibility. These
laws not only offend against fun.
damental human rights, but alsoin- |
vite serious abuses of due process and |
the Rule of Law. .

It is most disturbing that Mr
Shipanga, at the taxpayer's expense,
and protected by a statutory immuni-
ty against possible legal action,
repeats unchecked allegations by an
obecure letter writer and then, on the
basis of those slanderous allegations
proceeds to ‘sharply’ criticise a senior
and respected Priest of the order of
the Oblates whose dedication
towards the protection of Christian
values in this territory can hardly be |
questioned. !

Mr Shipanga has chosen Father |
Nordkamp as a target of severe |
criticism. At the same time Mr |
Shipanga however chooses to remain
silent about the Police’s admission
under oath in the Heita trial present-
ly before the Windhoek Supreme
Court, presenting a picture of brutal
violations of the most elementary
human rights and an alarming
disregard for law and order by the
police. : -

Reply to Kozo

WE HAVE read, with interest, a letter
received from Minister Kozonguizi
typed on a letterhead of the Depart
ment of Information, indicated that
even such letters are done at the tax
payer's expense

Minister Kozonguizi’s epistle is
what hecallsa “review” ofour booklet

“The Choice - Namibia Peace Plan
435 or Socrety under Siege”

The booklet attempts to present
Namibians with the facts and by the
proviston of these facts and the
analysts of these facts, to strengthen
the commitment of ali these who call
for immediate impiementation of
Resolution 435 of 1975

Itconstitutes analysis as weil asad

trast tothe typeofadvocacy anddistor
tion of facts by the Honourable
Minister and all those institutions,
parties. groups, persons and
mouthpieces with whom the
Honouruble Minister, his yovernment
andthe South African Government. ts
closely associated

It presents the truth in rebuttal of
the propaganda daily poured out for
Mr Kozonyuizi s cause and financed by
millions. if not billions of Rand from
the pockets of the South African and
Namibia taxpayers, andin the case of
Namibia without the consent of the
taxpayers and without the consent of
Namibians

If ever there was denigration
without facts and without reasen, vou

quately in our booklet and readers are
referred to it

We can all agree thata constitution
isone ofthe most important pillars of
a stable democratic state -1f not the
very foundationof it, But surely such
an important basic document must
represent the will of the people of
Namuibra otherwise it will have to be
imposed andthenit will not be worth
the paper on which it is written To
represent the will of the people, it
follows that only truly elected
representatives of the people can
represent the will of the people

Andtoelect such representatives of
the people who will thendraw upacon
stitution for Namibia. in the exercise
of their self-determination and right
to independence, 1s the very aim and
essence of Resolution 435 of 1978

After the constitution so drawn up by
the elected representatives, there
could be a further election forthe first
government of Namibia in terms ofthe
agreed constitution That willineffect
meanaconstitution before anclection
for a Namibian government

In the case of Namibia. however.
there already exists an international
ayreement.on the inclusion of certain
specified constitutional principles and
fundamental human rights in the
future constitution of Namibia and
also safeguards for the protection of
minorities in the form ofa provision for
proportional representation and for
the further details of the constitution
to be decided upon by at least a two
thirds majority

So itis clear that even here a com-
promise hus already been reached
between those who want a constitution
first and those who want an election
before a constitution

Swapo hasconsistently stood by the
peace plan and the democratic elec:
tions provided for in it, whereas
Minister Kozonguiz:. Minister
Shipanga and others show no sign of
suggesting anv sort of country-wide
elections to legitimise their appoint
ments by the SA Government Have
vou redefined democracy, Minister
Kozonguizi? If 30, please let the ‘in
telligent” readers have vour definition
and your government's planof action
for democracy. self-determination and
internationally recognised
independence.

If vour vague allegations ayainst
Swapo ure trut, you should welcome
elections in termsof Resolution 435 of
1978 because then vou can attack and
denigrate Swapo in their presence in
front of the Namibian people The
peace plan provides for the return of al!
refugees and one can imayine the
many witnesses then becoming
available to substantiate these
charges. iftrue, Why miss such an ex
cellent opportunity to free the tortured
refayees and confront Swape face to

four. Inthe political realm the choices
seem to be three (1) capitulation » by
which 1 mean that South West Africa
may bow to fate by accepting the South
African settlers and abiding bv the dic
tates of the Pretorta government, (2)

negotiation - tn the hope that the SA
Government may modify its position
which would amount to capitulation:
(Srindifference inthe hope thatother
countries, other powers, may take up
their struggle and attain freedom for
them. None of these, especially the first,
seems very likely

The fourth 1s armed struggle
whichis alwayseasier todiscuss than
toplan, easertoorganise than to carry
out, for it must be pursued with
ruthless determination to win and
it must be reinforced by a principl-
ed dedication to the cause. From
thier public pronouncements, iLseems
clear that the leaders of South West
Africa are moving in the direction of
armed struggle”

ft appears that the Honourable
Minister has since 1966 accepted the
firstoption above viz “Capitulation. ”

What basis do Namibians have for
beheving that the interim government
willabide by whatever constitution it
might draw up, when itis responsible
tonoclectorate having never faced an
election?

Excuse of UN Partiality: We
acknowledge tn our booklet the fact of
UN partiality, but we explain whys it
will not have any effect on the judge
ment of Namibians ina 445 election
But why don't you acknowledge South
Africa’s partiality? Why not?

The Honourable Minister of Justice
has often inthe past reiterated thatin
Africa power comes from the barrel ot
agun, and we suspect that he and some
of his associates have accepted this
credo.

It seems futile to argue with the
Minister about free and fair elections
Ifinterested in elections at all.it will
have to be elections which he can be
guaranteed to win- and free and fair
elections are unlikely to lead to that
result

According to news reports around
25 000 people are benefiting from an
emergency feeding scheme. The
Department of National Health and
Welfare, and private welfare organiza-
tions, like the Red Crogs are involved.
While having sympathy with
hungry people, and supporting the ef:
forts to help, we have to ask ourselves,
“Why are these people starving”. The
following problems are contributing to
the problem viz:
A) Population Growth:
The annual population growth hovers
around three percent. Fifty percentof
the population is 15 years or younger,
and therefore unproductive. Between
© to 10 percent are retired and no
longer make a contribution. Present-
ly only 20 percent ofthe population are
gainfully economically employed, and
of this group, one quarter works for the
State. The balance 20-25% are either
subsistence farmers or unemployed.
The population growth ou tstrips
food production, housing resources,
schooling, Health services and job crea-
tion. As @ result the population
becomes poorer and poorer, and the
economically active group smaller in
proportion. It is always tempting in an
effort toredistribute wealth, to heavi-
ly tax this group. Care must however
be taken not tokill the goose that lays
the golden eggs.
B) Drought:
Namibia isasemi-desert country and
droughts are part of life. The problem
arises when the odd few good rainfal]
years are taken asthe norm and no pro-
vision is made for the inevitable bad
years in nature's cycle.
C) Farming Methods:
Farming methodsaresometimes very
destructive, especially in the com-
munal areas. There, no rotation graz-
ing is implemented and very little con-
trol is exercised over stock numbers.
Traditionally the number of cattle iB
a symbol of wealth, irrespective of their
condition. Owners are alsooften loathe
to sell their cattle, even in times of
drought, with resultant destruction of
grazing and death, as witnessed a few
years ago in Kaokoveld. The result ig
the same as in the Sahel region in
North Africa. Man has totally upset
the delicate balance of nature for short
term gain, with longterm destructive
results, |

D) Guerrilla War: | |

‘| avesult ofthe political uncertaintyiand —
BVO US SO

-D) Guerrilla War:

The war, especially in Owambo, con-
tributes tothe misery ofthe locals. As
-aresult ofthe political uncertainty and
‘lack of international recognition, in-
vestments are not readily made in
‘Namibia, with resultant meagre job
creation. The spill-over of the war in
Angola, streches our limited resources
with refugees.

E) Good Medica! Services:

As a result of good medical services
more people survive in an otherwise
often hostile environment. There isa
sense of fatalism and the beliefthat the
State will provide for all needs. This 1s
often demanded as a right which the
State has to satisfy. Unfortunately this
demand is not matched by responsibil.
ty or contribution. In order to try and
solve the problem, and to avoid an
ecological and biological disaster, the
problem must be tackled with political
will.

A) Population Planning:

Namibia isnyt arichcountry. Many of
its resources are transient cy.
diamonds(CDM), base minerals(TC1.),
uranium (Rossing), gas(KUDU), and
gold(Karibib). When the mines close,
this source of income is gone. The
resources remaining will be farming,
fishing, tourism and human. If the
human resource is planned and nur.

tured it will be the most important.

One Just has to look at Japan, a coun-
try with virtually no natura!
resources, but an incredible human
resource.

Due to the population explosion,
China has taken drastic steps aiming
at one child per family. Parents who
want more will have to pay and forfeit
free services and free schooling. This
may sound very radical but one hasto
he cruel to be kind. The alternative is
another Ethiopia. Here the initial
worldwide enthusiasm and Bob
eldoft waned as 400n as the TV im.
ages faded and aid mismanay
became known gement

Population planning can also not be
seen in the white/black political con-
text. Already blacks outnumber
whites by more than twelve to one.
Whether it is two to one or 12 to one
makes no difference in aone-manone-

~
*
vote election. Therefore population
planning as a form of imperialistic,
capitalistic, racial suppression, has no
logical or scientific basis.

With the present growth curve,
demands on health, housing, food,
education andemployment, are in ex:
cess of supply, and the situation is
worsening. Demand greater than
supply boosts inflation, whichinturn
aggravates poverty even further. It is
a vicious cycle. Only a firm political
statement of intent and action, can
break this cycle. It will require a brave
man to doit, but if successfull, he will
go down in history as the man who
brought progress and prosperity. Peo-
ple will become independent of, rather
than dependent on the State.

B) Farming Methods:

Farming methods must become scien-
tificand conservative. Namibia is vir-
tually only suited to livestock and
game farming. The delicate ecological
symbiosis must be nurtured for future
generations.

C) Political Settlement

’ (AG8 and Resolution 435):

The guerrilla war can only be ter-
minated by a political settlement. It is
often said that Namibia must decide
its own future, but to most who have
followed the political yo-yo game, it is
obvious that outside sources from a
number of sides are manipulating our
future. A settlement will hopefully
bring peace, stability, investment and
prosperity.

D) Good Medical Services:

Good medical services must gohandin |
hand with education and economic ©
progress.

E) Political Independence:

Political independence depends on
economic independence. Namibia’s
resources must be developed by Nami-
bians for Namibia, with help if
necessary. Presently symptoms and
not causes are treated. This only
postpones a solution until it becomes
insurmountable.

Man has been able to control all
other formsofliebut not himself. One
of the few people still inharmony with
nature is the Kalahari bushman. He
sets anexcellentexampleofliveand let
live, unlike the suicidal lemmings of
the Antarctic.

You don't help a poor man by giving
him a fish, but by showing him how to
catch a fish. The aim should be in-
dependence not hand-out nurtured
dependence.

OPEN LETTER TO
NOMTSOUB COUNCILLORS

THE CONSUMER boycott of the
white business urea froin the
mineworkers is in its sixth week on
Tsumeb.

Many of the white businessmen are
really feeling it now. because there
is nothing to keep the business run-
ning on.

For the attention of the General
Manager of the Mine (TCL) there are
certain workers demands, which 1n-
clude a call for an increase in
salaries. There ure ulso grievances
concerning the high taxes they pay;
and the war in the north.

The residents are supposed to put
their grievances to the Numtsoub
Community Councillors who were
never elected by the residents of the
town. The socalled Councillors
distribute some propaganda through
the Nomtsoub township as well as in
the workers’ hostel.

They say that we are ina free and
independent land. Please, Coun.
cillors, don’t mislead the people.
Think of what happens in the nor
thern part of our country. People are
suffering and innocent people are dy-
ing ut the hands of SADF and
Koevoet.

[t is our money we pay in taxes that
they use to buy Casspirs, to destroy
our lands, and perpetrate other
similar deeds.

Don't say the workers are wrong
because they are hoycotting the
white business area.

In those papers they distribute
among the Nomtsoub residents, they
try to use the people to inform the
police who are the culprits, to tell
people not to buy in the white area.

] AM not writing on behalf of black
nurses only buton behalfofall nurses,
irrespective of colour, because the nur-
sing profession knows no colour.
‘Disgusted’ of Katutura recently
wrote about one incident concerning
the profession, but not all of it. Let me
tell all Namibian taxpayers what they
pay for. The pay raise which has been
announced isnot s-lvingthe problem,
but is part of it.

Recently a groupof women from the
different communities came together
to consult with the nursing heads,
thinking that thay could help to iden;
tify the problems and at the same time
solve them, which was a good and
sound gesture. But instead of trying to
improve the situation, the nursing
heads felt that they stood
unreasonably accused, and wanted
names and dates when the incidents
happened.

Isay that ‘silence never won rights’
There are those of us who sat at that
meeting and took note of what was —
said. But how are we to improve condi-
tions when there were posts advertis-
ed almost a year ago and so far we have
heard nothingabout them. Insteadin
the latest hospital news brief, we read
of someone who is being moved from
one high post to another. Nothing
advertised. Where does the post sud-
denly come from? The joke is that the
person who has been appointed has to
be taught by the old staff. The post she
has left has to wait for another
‘favourite friend’ in order to be filled?

If the senior structure is not right,
then what motivation is there for the
rest of the personnel to be faithful?
What areall the sisters doing in the of-
fice - why must they all be doing
statisticsand filing? Why can'tclerks
be employed, and let the nurses do nur-
sing tasks.

The nursing care on the wards is not
up to scratch. So Mrs Barlow, take a
hint and do something to improve the
situation. Do you need all those nurses
around your office?

There is another incident about
which all nurses are aware: sometime
last year asenior retired nurse was ad-
mitted to hospital for » major opera-
tion, and two days after the operation
she wasatill lying therein her theatre
gown, not in the best of health. How
does that sound? It is not only the per-
son in the street who suffers, but ‘old

nurses’ too.

Please do something about this
situation. Reduce the number of

nurses around you, Mrs Barlow, you
don’t need them all for moral support.

1 AM a regular reader of your paper,
feeling the need to be broadly inform:
ed- alsoon issues and events which are
often neglected or distorted by other

papers.

Lwas quite shocked though, when be-
ing confronted with your article
“Trophies and the Hunted’ by M Ver.
baan and the editorial ‘A threatened
lifestyle (Both in The Namibian of Oc-
tober 16).

These two contributions to the topic
of Bushmanland appear s0 superficial
and without any background know.
ledge by the writers that I feel obliged
tocomment The only purpose of the
said contributions seems to be one of
sensationaliam and propagandism
aimed at belittling and degrading the
interim government - at the cost of
sound reporting on the Bushmans’
plight and the different possible and
realistic alternatives.

Though | share your views on the il
legitimacy of the interim government
and on soonest implementation of in
ternattonally recognised in
dependence, I do not think that this
warrants bad journalism aiming at
political gain especially on a subpect
asimportant for partofthe Namibian
nation as thisone

In my opinion, the main statement
ls @ positive one, namely, that the
region will not be proclaimed a game
reserve Thisis what the argument was
going on about and what concerned
people had feared would happen Your
statement ‘the Cabinet are obvious
ly going to have to lure the prime
trophy animals such as lion and
elephant into Bushmanland’’ is quite
ndiculous. The ‘game such aslion and
elephant” are NOT '‘going to flock to
the area’’ as M Verbaan states, because
theese species are already abundantly
present in Bushmanland

This ia exactly the problem the
Bushmen are faced with al] the time!
The only possible solution would thus
seem a reduction in numbers by hun-
ting Possibly a very smal! percentage
could be jured out into Koudom game
reserve by additional water holes
there.

Now tothe y hunting, thiecer-
tainly does NOT imply “rifle toting
hunters” flooding the area every
season, or the “region to be inundated
by foreigners armed with highpowered
rifles, searchlights, jeeps and

landrovers”’

Trophy-hunting is a very
sophisticated form of hunting involv.

ing highly-skilled professional
hunters. trackers and camp staff, as
wellasskinners all usually well-paid
and good jobs. certainly not to be
sneered at the way you did in the
editorial

The “season” for trophy hunting
comprises virtually the whole vear. no
flood of rifle-toting hunters is involy-
edusis possible during our two month
“biltong hunting season” and no
spotlights are used whatsoever, as is
the case during the niyght-calliny
operations

This very individualised. exclusive
trophy -hunting reaultsinthe highest
income per hunted animal, while the
hunting operation itself is the best
paid tourrst activity in the country
and all this 1n foreign currency

lam stating these facts after nine
years’ experience ag a professtonal
hunting guide. Ihave also at the begin
ning of thik month. visited
Bushmanland for six daya: NOT toget
a hunting concession, but to inform
myself

During aconversation with Mr Mar-
shal} of the Bushman Foundation, he
himselfcalculated that the income for
one trophy elephant would pay forthe
installation of acomplete cattle drink.
ing point - LIF the income goes to the
benefit of the Bushmen. And this, I
believe, isthe point where work hasto
be done - namely to ensure proper
distribution ofthe income generated,
#0 an to benefit the Bushman
population.

Asfar asl know, Mr Hartung, he too
would see this matter in the same
light, and I would in general agree
with you that - ifsolittle consultation
with the population and the experts
has taken place - this isnot acceptable,
though this does not at the eame time
make the decision takan a bad one.

It certainly isabetter solutionthan
the practice inb the ‘good old days’
when one of the present day interim
government ministers took it upon

himselfto “freethe population of such
problem animals” on taxpayers’ ex
pense by shooting from an army

on the way to work, others was
undecided. I noticed no activities to in-
dicate the strike. Small groups of police
were standing around fires at bus stops
to get warm in the cold.

From chats I had with people this
morning and the days before I learned
that all agree that there wasreason for

had complaints about what was done
and how the actions were exercised.
They complained about being in-

Instead of more, much-needed educa.
tion for our pupils according to the
slogans of NANSO, there was less
education and less tests Instead of
more pay and a livable salary for
workers there was less pay and a loss
of jobs. Instead of better relations bet-
ween people and between groupsthere
was a disturbance of relations. The
economy lost millions of Rand. The
State lost taxes from which schools.

Namiubians cut themselves off from the

earn more. In this way we subjugate
ourselves voluntarily tothe principle

Are we Namibians not abletothink
of more reasonable and wiser actions
which donot disturb relations between
us? Must we harm ourselves? Why not
actions after classes and work? Or
short stay-awavys of fifteen minutes at
certain time and day throughout the
country as a demonstration of sym-
pathy for a certain matter?

Or let the workers work and earn
money (and not strike on certain
dates), and then ask the workers to
donate a part of those earnings into a
funds for financing community
development projects or others. We are
in need ofa private trade school togive

necessary educational facilities. lam

Costs of 435

WHAT many Namibians have warned
against for many years has now come
to pass. As soon as the South African
Government tells us of ‘agreement’
with regard toimplementation of 435,
we are informed that it will cost
billionsandthe UN must now look for
the money.

For years, all UN resolutions aimed
at preserving the natural wealth of our
country, have been ignored by South
Africa and all those nations exploiting
our natural resources. South African
occupation of Namibia costs millions
aday but no money is available for the
implementation of the peace plan.
Salaries of South Africa’s proxies in
Namibia have been increased time and
again and for that, money was

available. And in all this, Namibians
had no say, they only paid taxes.

While we are not overexcited at thie
point that the agenda for implementa-
tion will follow the time schedule that
was indicated by the SA Foreign
Minuater, the time has come for Nam.
bians to state their position with
regard to who will foot the bill Surely
we cannot accept that our country has
become a poor and underdeveloped and
dependent country all of a sudden

suggestions to the UN Secretary
General who will now be presented
with the bill

ponder

Namibia still has some resources
therefore we propose that an indepen.
dent commission be established im
mediately with complete insight into
all transactions involving monies leav-
ing this country, with immediate
effect,
_ that all export of Namibian natural
resources be monitored by the UN and
all resources accruing therefore, be put
in a fund towards paying for
implementation;
= that with immediate effect, all
monies collected through sales tax be
paid into the abovementioned fund;
C that the exhorbitant salaries paid
to SA proxies in Namibia be im-
mediately stopped and that money be

pat in the abovementioned
all know that the AG andthe BA
civil service runs Namibla and they
should receive salaries from the ool-
onial] power according to international
Practice;
O thatal) these companies which, ac-
cording to the Thirion Report, have
been sending out natural resources il-
legally, or have paid leas taxes than
they should have, be compelled to pay
the said amounts in the implementa.
tion fund;
J that all taxes paid by Namibiansin
order to fund second tier authorities,
be channelled into the said fund.

Since the people of this country have
never hed a say in whathappenstothe
funds collected through the means
above, they should do eo now. The six
points mentioned above are only
pointers. We realise there should be
some control and therefore suggest
that all those parties which have been
in favour of the implementation of 435
now form a watchdog committee and
take this issue up immediately. All
Namibians know that thesaid parties
are constituent members of the /Ai-

of most participants, who attended the
conference. But was it, really? We do
not profess to know. We were not there,
and, apart from what little informa-
tion appeared about it :n ‘The Nami-
bian’ of the 21 October, we have very iit-
tle information about what was
discussed. Perhaps somebody will soon
write some more about it!

However, the Lusaka conference pro-
vides a good starting point to remind
ourselves again of the socialist objec.
tives of a future Swapo government.
And let us make it clear at the outset,
that our allegiance lies within that
broad movement, as the only move.
ment, truly and realistically express.
ing national aspirations at the mo.
ment. But that support could never be
unconditional. There is too much at
stake for that to happen.

Article 111(7) & (8)of the Constitu.
tion, states that a Swapo government
would “exercise effective control over
the major means of production and
distribution, and work towardsanon-
exploitative and non-oppressive
classless society’’ No doubt it should
sound sensible for most businessmen
in Namibia to want to trade off some
of the huge profits they are making at
the moment in return for political
stability and international accep-
tance. But how much would they real-
ly be willing to give up within the
broad concept of Article 111? A pro-
greasive tax rate of up to 60% or more?

~But rather let us be clear about the
kinds of benefits the suffering Nami-
bian masses should, and ought, to ex-
pect from a socialist government, after
this long and arduous struggle.
1. SOCIALSERVICES: This isan area
under which some ‘socialist countries’,
eg. the USSR, and some mixed
economies, ag Sweden's appear to
have done vies It may be argued

by the regime to the south of them.
There is indeed, no reason why the
Namibian working claas should notex-
pect the right toa minimum wage, the
right to work, to full employment,
health, free education. relatively free
travel, and accomodation. Unlessone
is led to believe in the propaganda of
the very people who have led a policy
of creating a dependent and exploited
economy, the availability of those basic
services, at least in the ameliorated
sense that workers are guarenteed in-
dome by the state that willensurethem
access to these basic neccesities,
should be something of a medium., if
not immediate-term objective, of the
future people’s government. Indeed
with a population of about 1,5 million
people, and with the country’s
argricultural, mining and fishing
potential, together with the potential
in under-developed processing in-
dustries, the prospect of Namibia
feeding itself is, in the sense describ-
ed, not a mere pie-in-the-sky notion.
Such prospects must be a lure to the
skilled labour forced in particular, to
remain even after independence.
However, those expectations might
have to be adjusted and related to the
extent to which they are willing to

_ allow citizens to share the country's

resources.

2. MARKET FORCES: These lead to
unequal distribution of wealth and
power, and are therefore essentially
unacceptable in contravening Article
111. However we may need to be
pragmatic. It may he argued, quite
reasonably, that, without paying our
way through the world market, our
economy might stagnate, or even

pase
lo Hencethe Namibian worker
aay have to:accept a lower wage to
‘enable our products to sell com.
petitively at international levels, and
to attract foreign investment. This
may well be true. But, attheendofthe
day, the issue ia often a political one,
and, with international acceptance, a
‘Swapo government may wellbe ableto
negotiate favourable quotas and terms
of trade with bodies such as the EEC
and various governments, including
the so called ‘Third World’ countries.
It is, of course, also true that the deci-
sion to be made is essentially one of
deciding what social costs we are
prepared to pay for the sake of ‘develop-
ment’. And, as has already been in-
dicated; we do not believe that that
price has to be very high.

It is also perhaps, here that indepen-
dent trade unions might havearoleto
play in safeguarding workers’ in-
terests. But, and this is, of course,
again, a controversial issue, we may
have to steer clear of ‘ultra-leftist’
trades unions. Not that there is
anything wrong with such trades
unions in principle. But the idea that
blocking, say, the sale of Namibian
uranium, will bring the international
capitalist system crumbling down, or
export revolutions to other countries,
seems, inthe currentclimate, at best,
idealistic, but could involve tremen-
dous social and economic cost on the
part ofasmal! nation that hasalready
had more than its fair share of suffer-
ing under the status quo.

3. DEMOCRACY: Mr. Geingob is
reported in ‘The Namibian’ to have
paid that ‘There cannot be democracy
only at the expense of the majority, and
a Swapo government will extend

E sill people. That is basically Article
; 1116) af the constitution, and, in the

world of ‘perestroika’ and ‘power tothe

‘Certainly, Swapo has very little to

oe eeaeans

eanndin.

toall spheres of life, and for.

doctrination and, with the -ses-¢
capitalist values in which we are swint
ming worldwide, the potential {is
strong for reactionary forces te
manipulate the scene. Hence the im-
portance that may, perhaps, have tobe
placed upon responsible media and a
comprehensive educational system.
Freedom of the press, and open govern-
ment are principles that we all sup-
port, but they must be balanced
against society's interest in informed,
as opposed to misinformed, decision
making. Certainly, whilst the racist
regime in the south prevails, these in-
terests might have to be carefully
balanced. What we could certainly not
afford to do, is to let working people suf-
fer so much for independence and
freedom, and then extend the existing
life of concrete reality ina camouflag-
ed form.

IN SUMMARY: It has not been the ob-
jective of this brief article to criticise
what was said, or not said, at the
Lusaka conference. Indeed, the con-
ference was a significant and welcome
political development. Rather, our at-
tempijhas been merely to restate and
keep alive the debate as to the road to
socialist development for Namibia,
after independence. In view of the
debate raging in ‘socialist countries’
atthe moment, tothe extent that some
leading personalities are reported to
have questioned the wisdom of the
revolutions that took place there at all,
as wel] as welcoming extreme right
wing political leaderstoexpound their
obnoxious philosophies to their people,
it is important, even more go for us in
Namibia, toopen up as many areasas
possible for debate - now.

‘Security’

PLEASE allow me a space in the
people’s newspaper to highlight
iS a ae and ae
amibian people at large, the
discriminatory practices applied
here in the  Caprivi
Administration.
I was shocked by the wrongful
nis ; Rennes of the

mf

ty!

apparently aimed at the furtherdnce
of National Party’ policies, on a
monthly basis. No black man attends
theese meetings.

Presently the situation in Caprivi
allows for taxation of Caprivians and
not whites as the latter claim that
Act 2 of 1974 is applicable to Caprivi-
ans only. The 8A Government has
done nothing to repeal this legisla-
tion.

Caprivian officials pay one per
cent of their income (monthly), in
addition to the general tax payable to
the Receiver of Revenue. A surpris-
ing fact is that there are_no income
tax returns handed to taxj;ayers as is
habitual with the Receiver of Reve-
nue. It is disturbing too, to find that
the following people do not pay this
(one percent) tax: all Caprivians
employed by other government de-
partments and/or private inetitu-
tions; all whites and non-Caprivians
employed by the Administration; all
tribal indunas; general dealers and
traders in the area.

] wish to call on progressive Ca-
privi Administration officials to re-
ject this uncalled-for tax. This act of
the colonisers should be viewed seri-
ously and the nominated Executive
Committee abolished with immedi-
ate effect. It has failed to satisfy the
wishes of the people aa it is only
dancing to the tune of its masters
(the whites). How can they allow
Caprivians to be milked by theese
people?

This legislation should be tested in
a court of law.

In addition the whites in the area
are presently trying to separate
Caprivi from the rest of progressive
Namibia. The suffering of Caprivi is
largely due to the fact that the area is
used as a dumping ground for whites
who have failed to make the grade
elsewhere.

Lastly I want to call on the intell!-
gentaia in the region to mobiles
people for independence. No other
region in Namibia hae a ‘white godfa-
ther’ like in Caprivi. Come, one and
all, let ue stand tagether and fight
the colonialiets."

‘A sensitive nerve

Indeed Mr Shipanga's ‘New Year's
Message’ touched a sensitive nerve
in me, especially with the untruths
and political dishonesty that ‘mes-
sage’ displayed.

In his article (27/01/89) Mr Shipanga
implies that because Father Wolfe
had said that ‘‘reconciliation of the
Namibian people as a whole is needed
before we can become one Namibia
one Nation’’, then anybody who uses
the word ‘reconciliation’ on televi-
sion must go unchecked. Mr Shipanga,
reconciliation is not merely an event
- it is a process in which not only
what we say, but also what we do,
will determine the essence of our
determination.
~ So do not think that people will
believe your sincenty because you
use the words ‘peace’ and ‘reconcili-
ation’, even more so when your frame
of reference is artificial: (that your
TGNU protected the rights of Na-
mibians during the past. three-and-a-
half years).

| maintain, Mr Shipanga, that your
Cabinet sided with the South Afncan
‘government in trying to stop duc
legal process, and I add that all this
was done at the expense of the tax-
payers, Please say this is not true, and
tell the Namibian people what posi-
tion did you take, and what you as
Cabinet did in the interest of due
legal process in the iste Wapota and
| *Shifidi cases.

Taleo maintain that national cam-
paigns and international diplomatic
- gnd economic pressure forced the |
ence.

a) National campaigns:

- When the churches marched on
_ the side of the poor (Corpus Chnst)
gangs from some government circles
could not stop them. When Kameeta
gave that emouonal address at St
Andrews in Khomasdal, the people
were moved to action, and more
Koevoet was armed and deployed on
the strects of Katutura

- When Swapo held a public rally
after five years of silence, fifteen
thousand people came. Apartheid
shivered in Namibia and police and
army tactics were adjusted as evident
in the circumstances surrounding the
death of Shifidi.

- When concerned namibians as-
sisted workers to bind together in
defence of their rights, their lives, -
an action which culminated in the —
organised workers movement sec- —
ond to none in the history of Namibia —
- your Cabinet moved in with bills to —
serve that initiative a death —

blow, and thanks to, yes, national
r | iy 1
law, and it was thus stillbom, re-
member? Remember the ILO expen-
ence when your cabinet was trying to
Jobby against the Namibian workers
for fear of ‘political manipulation’?
All your actions did not succeed be-
cause the workers were always astep
ahead of your cabinet.

Mr Shipanga, if this is not ‘na-
tional campaigns , what is?

(b) International campaigns:

Well, inthe interest of spacc I shall
not dwell, because after all itis obvi
OUuS:

- thatitis because of intemational
diplomatic and economic pressure
on the government in South Africa
that your TGNU was not recognised
by a single country as such.

- that the South Afncan Rand has
and continues to plunge, to the extent
thal (as you correcuy pomt out) South
Afnca had to recognise that it cannot
continue to enforce her preferences
through intermediaries of her unilat-
eral choice; and that the cost of re-
taining control has come to, and in
fact has long exceeded, the benefit.

It is in this Context interesting to
note what South African Minister of
Finance, Barend du Plessis, said in a
recent interview in Leadership (a South
African journal),

Mr du Plessis was asked a question
on sanctions and he said: (paraphrased)
the question of sanctions is rather
delicate to discuss because, if you
say they are not working, you are
inviting more; and if you say they are
working, you are inviting more.

This | think is indicative of inter-
national diplomatic and economic
| pressure on South Africa. Suffice it
| to quickly add that national and in-
- termational campaigns are necessar-
ily complementary.

ment in camera. But | do know that

nomic pressure on South Africa, and

Finally I am surprised that Mr
Shipanga only now sees it fittomvite
me to join hands with other Namibi-
ans to build the son of country of
which we can all be proud, while he
knows that it was my commitment
all along. |

Mr Shipanga knows that when he
and his cabinet were campaigning |
for ‘alternative’ models for Namibia's
independence because ‘UNSC Reso-
lunon 435 was dead’ I] was among
those who were calling for the imme-
diate implementation of 435.

Mr Shipanga knows that during

by his Koevoet, | was among those
who mobilised resources to defend
these victims. He knows that I was

As reported in The Namibian (Fnday

Some ex-combatants have not yet
acquired jobs. Many have lost their

them. Our education system has to
continue to support racists and auto-

so as to retain their jobs, all for the
sake of reconciliation. Is’ ‘reconcill-

It seems that we are not only
“reconciling’’ with ex-colomal

wants to mould itself according to
them. Our leaders preached equ ality,

On diamond theft

I WISH to react to CDMs campaign
against diamoad theft.

I would like to make it categon-
cally clear that this campaign amounts
to cheap propaganda on the part of
this company.
CDM said recently that ‘‘employ-

oes developed a philosophy that dia-
mond theft wa’ legitimate and there-
fore not morally wrong as the com-
pany itself was perceived to be *steal-
ing’ diamonds from the Namibian
nation”

Iwant to tell CDM that the people
of Namibia are sick and red of
~mmulti-nationals. It is a wellknown
ufect that CDM and other companies

<4, ‘AEsca to exploit, oppress Namibi-

Therefore the company conmmuit-
ted untold unforgivable and unfor-
gettable contraventions such as over-
mining and transfer pncing.

Furthermore, de Beers, the owners
of CDM, have created a number of
subsidiaries that held onto mining
and prospecting nghts and the fees
paid to them are set against tax.

One subsidiary, the Manne Dia-
mond Corporation, leased to CDM
several prospecting and mining ar-
eas along the Atlantic Coast.

Itisclearthat this deal was made to
avoid paying tax. This is a grossly
unpatnotic act and amounts to eco-
nomic sabotage in our country. It is
also designed to prevent economic
growth.

In theory CDMs operations were/
are overseen by the socalled Dia-
mond Board of SWA, which advised

the South African Administrator

General. However, he himself dis-

covered that the Board nover had’
physical control of the diamonds.

All inspections and supervisions
were done by CDM, mostly white
South Africans, who parcelled up the
diamonds and despatched them to
Kimberley, where they were valued
by de Beers officials and not Namibi-
ans.

The Goverment must not be misled
by CDM into thinking that it is its
employees who are ‘stealing’ the
diamonds.

If diamonds are being stolen, per-
haps it is also whites who are not
searched. The security men who work
at the gate on the Namibian/South
African border are whites, and some
of them live at Alexander Bay. They
are not Namibians and they often
search only blacks while whites are
given the green light.

It is also an insult that the people
who control entry into Oranjemund
are ¢x CDM shop assistants, mostly
females from South Africa.

Lastly, instead of CDM asking its
employees to hand in stolen diamands
from 23 to 29 August, they them-
selves mist hand in diamonds which
are kept in Kimberley and London.

THE sight of a dreadfully drunk and

destrians’ simplistic reaction was
either to laugh or shake their heads.

Alcoholism is the worst social

there’s a far easier means {0 contnb-
ute to solving part of the problem
they present: ‘Pushers’ all over the

can ruin their lives having to serve

guilty.

But because liquor is so socially
acceptable, no one thinks of those
who sell it as people who share the
same responsibility for social miser-
ies as drug peddlars.

1 would be most surprised if sell-
ing liquor does not carry one of the
highest profit margins for formal and
informal entrepreneurs in southem

How about a tax being charged on
every drop of liquor which lines these
merchants’ pockets to sponsor a
rehabilitation centre for Namibians
unable to cope with alcoholism?

And let’s face it, a broad range of
people can be victims of alcoholism:
from shanty-dwellers in Damaraland
to inhabitants of posh Ludwigsdort.

If owners of licenced bottle store
outlets claim that informal ‘cucas’
and tombo sellers are equally re-
sponsible - tombo is frequently made
from powder which originates from
licenced shops with books to which
the Ministries of Finance and Health
end Social Services should have access.

On car abuse

of Wednesday, October 24, in which
he/she implied that the abuse of
government vehicles was the *‘order
of the day’ in the past and that it
went unchecked and unnoticed.
The implication in the letter was
also that the abuse of government
vehicles is no worse than in the past
and that the numerous complaints
arise out of resentment that ‘blacks
are driving luxury vehicles’.
I can tell Mr/Mrs FPP that in the
in which I work there
was (and still is) very strict control
over the use of State vehicles.

I WAS amazed to read ‘FPP’s' letter

The use ofa govemment vehicle as
transport to and from home was (and
stillis) strictly forbidden. The idea of
using a government vehicle for a
shopping tnp as one frequently sees
nowadays was completely out of the
question.

When I was shopping on Saturday
October 6, there were at least four
‘D...T' Toyota Landcmuisers parked
in the Wembhil car park. Whatever
Mr/Mrs FPP nught think, this type of
blatant nususe of our (as taxpayers)
property did not happen in the past,
and certainly not in the recent plus-
minus five years.

I am really not concerned with
whether the current offenders are
black or white, but [ am concerned
that taxpayers such as myself are
paying for the use of government
vehicles in flagrant violation of regu-
lations, which for some reason are
not being enforced in certain govern-
ment departments.

I appreciate that many civil ser-
vants are not able to afford to buy a
car for transport to and from work,
and that public transport in Wind-
hock is woefully inadequate.

Would it not then be a better idea
for departments to look at the possi-
bility of a bus/minibus collection
service instead of using countless
fuel-guzzling four-wheel dnve ve-
hicles to transport civil servants to
and from their place of work?

scandalous
accusation

! MY attention is drawn to the letter
| entitled ‘Foreigner’s woes’ by acer-
tain Mrs Cox of Olympia which
appeared in The Namibian of No-

vember 19,

Mrs Cox claims to have come to
Namibia six months ago with ‘'the
intention of establishing a legitimate
business’’. She was however, sur-
pnsed to have been told to call back
after three months for the work per-
mit which she is yet to receive.

Mrs Cox also put several questions
to the readers, such as:

- she does not know the reason for
the duration required for the process-
ing of passportfeitizenship documents.

| According to her three months is too

, long and extensions if necessary, are

, Not acceptable to her.

| 7 Mrs Cox does not teel officers of

_ the Ministry of Home Affairs have

; accordance with their job descrip-
hon, whether such information is
contained in the application forms or
not:

- she felt the Ministry is practising
delaying tactics and wants the Minis-
ter of Home Affairs to ‘call his offi-
cals to order’,

| According to her, Namibians were
not treated in the same way in her
country which she has not named.

These scandalous accusations di-
rected against our Govemment and
our law enforcement agency cannot
go unchallenged.

First of all, the socalled Mrs Cox

""failed to state her full name and address,

her country of origin and the type of

business she wants to undertake in

Namubia.

Secondly, official documents are
not just dished out anyhow, espe-
cially to foreigners, whether it be
passport, identity card, citizenship,
residential and work permits (that
may be done in the country Mrs Cox
comes from), ,

permanent residence or citizenship,

facilities.

These foreigners who do not ac-
cept that it is the prerogative and
nght of our government to contact
the affairs of the country the way
they see fit, are free to leave or not to
come here at all.

1 wonder if there is no more space
or change for the ‘establishment of a
‘egitimate business’ in the country
Mrs Cox comes from.

The occupation of our country lasted
105 years, while the war lasted about
23 years. With our independence we
have inhented a lot of pmblems which
our government is working day and
mght to resolve.

Our people are patient enough:
who 1s Mrs Cox not to be patient and
wait as required. Does she know that
not all Namuibians have passponss,
identity cards or birth certificates?

Or does she think the officials are
only employed to issue her work
permit. Please cool down Mrs Cox.

The other item of misleading in-
formation presented by her is the
allegations that Namibians were not

treated like that in the country she
comes from.
_ Which country is that? It must be
Stated that Namibians were badly
treated in many countries; they were

Some are thieves and crooks and
fortune seekers who failed to make it
in their own countnes and think we
are fools who do not know what we
are doing, and anyone who wants to
make a fortune can come to Namubia.

I want to wam these foreigners”
who want to stay in our country to
behave accordingly. They should
respect our laws; stop interfenng in
our politics and bear with us: we have
difficulties and they should help us
to build the country and not to de-
stroy it.

Tam also calling onthe Ministry of
Home Affairs to tighten our border
controls to prevent people who do
not want to respect our laws from
coming here.

It is also important to review work
pemuts, residence documents and to
control the issuing of identity cards
and passports which are already in
the possession of foreigners.

The Ministry must also make a
distinction between the genuine po-
litical refugees who should be as-
sisted; gemmine businessmen who want
to invest; and fortune seekers and
other refugees should be repatriated
to their own countnes.

We fought for this country and no
one should insult us or tell us how to
conduct our affairs. Mrs Cox must be
shown the way and go and do what
she wants in her own country.

I WISH to react to the speech deliv-

ered by the Swapo head and chief

coordinator, Moses Garocb, at a Swapo

Youth League seminar in Katutura

on December I.

The theme of the semunar was
‘Multi-party democracy in Namibia
and the role of the youth’. MrGaroeb
made a strong speech to the more
than 500 young people who gathered
in the community centre hall.

The speech, among others, con-

! centrated on the future prospects of
democracy in the country. He in
particular spoke out about the fair-
ness of the last elections in the coun-
try, which he said was full of decert
and ngging which resulted in Swapo
losing the two-thirds majonty.

The Swapo leader pointed out that
the failure to obtain the two third
majonty was due to the fact that
many foreigners were brought in from
South Africa and Angola to vote for |
the DTA and other political parnes.
This practice, he said, would not be
repeated in the next national election |
scheduled for 1995.

In this context, Garoeb called on
all Swapo members to work hard
politically in order to out-wit other
parties, in particular, the DTA, at the
polls, and gain atwo thirds majonty.

Well and good, this is the verdict
that all Swapo members will work
hard from now on to ensure an elec-
tion victory for Swapo in the next
general elections.

But there are several factors which
may still prevent Swapo from ob-
taining the deserved two thirds ma-
jority, if the leadership of the party
don’t start looking seriously into the |
problems facing the nation and in
particular, workers, supporters and
sympathisers of Swapo.

The reality is that on the ground
today many people, members and
supporters who voted the party into
power, are becoming disillusioned
with the manner in which different
Swopo leaders are looking at the
probleme facing the nation.

While no doubt is expressed about
the capabilities of the Swapo leaders
and functionaries to change the status
quo, one cannot ignore the fact that
most of our leaders are atil! enjoying
their independence haneymoon and
time is passing us by.

This ruthless exptoitation of our
people by the colomial regime was at
the time understandable. Bul now
that Namibia is free and the war is
ended, we see no reason why his
heavy tax should continue unabated.
We do understand the concem of the
government to generae funds through
revenue, but this should not be done
through open and blatant exploita-
tion.

This is my view will only enhance
tho system of the rich getting richer
and the poor getting poorer. Whar the
Governmen: should do ix at least
maintain personal income tax and
tax on imported luxury gooda and
abolish avertime super tax and gen-

While we all agree with the fact
thatthe Government has only been in
office for a short ime of eight months,
the vear 1991 must be a year of
practical restructuring and socio
econonuc improvements.

The immigration issue is also sen-
ous, and the Home Affairs Munustry
must set up a committee to Jook into

dent work permits for foreigners.

Women on tax

I WOULD like the Finance
Minister, Dr Otto Herngel, to
clanfy a few points concem-
ing the article “Women to benefit
from tax changes’ in The
Namibian of Monday January
27.

The article said that there
will be changes in the current
discriminalion against women,
particularly mamed women.
My questions are:

- why is the emphasis only
on mamed women? Is is be-
cause unmamied women do not
pay taxes or is it because they
are not discnminated against?

- why should married women
be singled out as victims of
discrimination and what is the
case with unmarried women in

this regard?

THE budget debate is still on
in our National Assembly so
that my suggestion conceming
the paymem of income tax
remains relevant.

It was quite ironical to hear
Finance Minister, Dr Herrigel,

ing remarks in his budget
speech about closing the loop-
boles in the system of taxing
perks which salary camers
receive.

Who gets more perks than
the Honourable Minister and
his fellow members of the Na-
tional Assembly and they do
not even pay tax on their large
income.

This is what ! find lacking in
the socalled debate about the
beg e Assembly. People

themselves on the
and congratulating the
Finance Minister about a sup-

posedly progressive budget,
instead of addressing the bum-
ing problem that they, like the
Pharisees in Biblical times,
“bind heavy burdens, hard to
bear, and lay them on people's
shoulders, but they themselves
will not move them with their
finger’' (Mathew 23:4).

I ask simply and humbly that
our National Assembly lIcgis-
late that they themselves, who,
after all, eam more than any-
body else, pay income tax an
their salaries and perks.

It is no excuse that it is re-
garded as tradition worldwide
that members of governments
donot pay taxes. It isa mark of

true leadership that those in
ae should not require
of their subjects anything which
they are not prepared to do or
give themselves.

Let Namibia become an
example to governments the
world over thal we are a truce

democracy oven in this respect.
IL ‘s only when the minister of
finance of a country and his
peers in government are sub-
ject to the same obligations as
other citizens of that country
that they will be sensitive to
the problems and needs of their
fellow citizens.

‘Special’
branch?

IN THE Namibian police we
have what is called a ‘special
branch’. Though I know the
meaning of the words “spe-
cial’ and ‘branch’, I fail to
understand what type of job

they are entrusted to fulfil by
the Government.

I would like to ask both
Minister Hifekepunye Pohamba

a or aL

¢ve what the job of the ‘special

branch’ ia?

The ‘special branch’ as I came
to know it, has a history which
is wellknown in this country.
[tis known because ofits noto-
riety, something like that of
Koevoei. Yet today the ‘spe-
cial branch’ continues to exist
and is the more privileged
section of the Namibian po-
lice.

Formerly they used to inter-
rogate captured guernilas, spy
on Swapo and quell Swapo

 mectings. What is their task

now? To quel) what? To pro-
tect the state? Have tncy changed
colours?

All you see now ts these
people driving their Ford Sier-
ras and Landcruisers in the
streets of Windhoek and other
towns.

It seems that they are not

, affected by the recent circular

of Deputy Inspector General
Andima which prohibits any
police car to be used for pn-
vate purpose £.

I, as a member of the Na-
mubian police, and a taxpayer,
am not satisfied with the fac.
that this ‘special branch’ stiil
exists.

If its continued existence
cames the approval of the
authonities, then its perform-
ances must be reviewed and
amended or terminated if their
job has ended.

The hard-working uniformed
members of the police walk
many kms in distance to work
and home, while those elite
policemen pass them by in their
Landcnuisers.

What are they doing that is
#0 important that they are even

allowed to park their cars at
home?

the Ministry of Transport and |
Works’ intention to start wid-
ening the road to the airport
within the next few weeks. I
was under the impression that
the government didn't have
money to throw around!

The report states that “the-
road improvements will knock
time off the tedious journey to
the airport”. Are we, as a de-
veloping country, with a des-
perate shortage of fundamen-
tal facilities such as schools
and hospitals, really able to
justify spending millions of
Rands merely to relieve a few
privileged people of a little
frustration?

It is interesting to look care-
fully at exactly the sort of time
that is going to be saved by the
road improvements. For the
forty kalometres from the
Windhoek city limits to the
airport, the youmey takes 30 |
minutes at an average speed of |
SOkm/hr. Were improvements
to make it possible to dnve at
an average speed of 1OOkmY/hr |
the journey would be reduced |
to 24 minutes.

A much cheaper solution to
the problem of getting to the
airport on time would be to
leave home six minutes earlier
than usual.

I] am sure thal the argument
will be raised that a widened
road will also be a safer road;

- that in the long run there will

be fewer fatalities. Although I
don't believe that this ts even

(three lane roads have in many
cases been shown to be the

feel that improved safety is not

any case. At the rk of sound-

Reply to the Rev. S J Titus’
letter in The Namibian, 3 June
1991, and the letter by Mr Johan
Pretorius of Keetmanshoop
published on 12 July:

Firstly, the letter by Rev S J
Titus stated ‘‘that the Honour-
ner

able Minister of Finance and

tis fellow members of the
National Assémbly do not pay
tax on their large incomes”’.

Members of the Cabinet and
National. Assembly are NOT
exempt from the payment of

income tax on their salanes

and fringe benefits, and this
statement by the Reverend
therefore has no substance. Only
a marginal portion of the sala-
ries of Cabinet members are
exempt from income tax, which
must be seen in the light of the
services they render in the
fulfilling of their duties and
ultimate responsibility to the
Republic of Namibia and its
people.

The letter by Mr Johan Pre-
torus from Keetmanshoop
states that he fully agrees with
the views of the Reverend Th-
tus and the above answer to the
letter by Rev Titus would there-
fore also apply. Mr Pretorius,
however, goes further and cnt-
cises the current income tax
system, mainly in respect of
the tranferability of abatements
between working spouses and
the lack of tax fences for those
taxpayers deriving mcome from
more than one trade.

The transferability of pn-
mary and children's abatements
must be seen as a compromise

between the system of com-
bined taxation and separate

taxation. Before March 1 1991
working marned women were
taxed on their income after
allowing anexemption of only
R1 000 while her husband
enjoyed the full married and
children’s abatements. The new
stem, whereby the married
anu children’s abatements are
divided equally in the case of
spouses earning taxable income
y from each other,
is therefore more in line with
Article 10 of the Constitution
of Namibia.
Mg Johan Pretosnus criticises

rere -queapring aes
OG ee
_ Article 10 of the Constitution
of Namibia.

Mr Johan Pretorius criticises
the present situation whereby
individuals having two or more
trades can, in some cases, off-
set business losses against their
salary income. It seems that
Mr Pretonus is in favour of a
system of socalled ‘‘tax-fenc-
ing’’. The introduction of such
a system will obviously neces-
sitate drastic statutory amend-
ments. Suffice it to say that
such a system will in general
lead to unjustifiable interfer-
ence with private enterprise
and the economic effects of
this could be more harmful
than those of the present sys-
tem. Mr Pretorius’ concems,
however, are noted.

To conclude, as was indi-
cated by the Honourable Min-
ister of Finance, Dr Otto
Hernigel, during his main
Budget speech this year, the
administration of taxation in
Namibia will be decentralised
in the very near future, so that
those Namibians living and
working in the south, will be
_ Drought ‘closer’ to Windhoek,
facilitating the process of
communication.

THE Pian pay-out problem
needs to be solved, and the
Government should by all
means try to do this. We know
there is not enough money for
all the people, but something
can be done. People are con-
. fused when the Minister of

| Information and Broadcasting
emphasises that those who were
not registered in September,
October and November last year
will not get paid.

I personally did not register
at that time, but it was not my
fault. Iwas ina Swapo mission
at that time, and I arrived in
Namibia from Zambia in De-
cember 1990 while the regis-
tranion count had stopped in
November.

When we arrived in Namibia,
we were taken to the Grootfon-
tein army base and we stayed
there for a few days and were
later taken to Windhoek for an
induction. But the programme
failed and we were told to go
back to our families and wait
to be called. Up to now none of
us has been called. We want to
| ask the Minister whether we

are to be blamed for late regis-

tration in these circumstances?

We stayed behind (in Zambia)

because we were ordered to

and not because we chose to.
Please, Minister Hidipo, try
to understand our problems.

We appreciate the programme

set up by the Government for

“be integrated into the develop- |

can do something with it. All
the ex-Koevoets and SWATF
members received their pay-

let this apply to Plan fighters

In other countries, people
make special programmes for
special problems. Like what
happened in Zimbabwe a few
years ago when they faced a
problem of schools. There were
many children in schools but
not enough to pay the teachers,
and so they increased tax for
those civil servants who were
getting high salanes and em-
ployed teachers to add to their
total number.

Now we have businessmen
and churches and other organ-
isations in our country - why
can't some of them contribute
to the development bngades
so that people can get some-
thing. Also all ex-Plan mem-
| bers must get paid out. What is

who know that they do not

ALLOW me, as a taxpayer, to
air my grievances to the pub-
lic, and especially to the Min-
ister of Home Affairs.

Since independence I have
noticed that policemen don't |
do their duties properly any-
more. We as taxpayers are |
confused by the manner in which
police vans are used. They are |
now acting as taxis between —
Khomasdal and Katutura and
police are transporting friends,
and girifnends, from mghtclub
to nightclub, especially from
the following places: Club
Thniler, Pamoda, Namibia Nite
and Suidwes Cafe.

People who lay charges wait
from between two to five hours
because they are told there are
no cars available, but in the
meantime they are being used
as above.

In this case I see that the
police are exploiting the tax-
payers, myself included. I think
itis better to employ 10 police-
men to do their duties properly
than to employ 100 who ex-
ploit the taxpayers.

It is far better to use police
cars for people who call for
help instead of sending them
out todo taxi jobs. Think about

Our taxpayers money please,"

WE hear a great deal about
‘affirmative action’ - but do
we ever look back after the
action and judge the results
thereof? For one thing is clear:
It never stops increasing the
mumber of employees and
inventing new (often superflu-
ous) functions in our civil serv-
ice with little attention paid to
qualities such as productivity
and effectiveness of purpose.
We seem to believe more and
more in numbers and pay less
and less attention to the func- |
tional and productive parts of
the service.

Hail a free press! For, if |
had to tell the relevant minis-
ter what I thought of the pro- —

censored me if he had the power
to do so. One thing is certain:
no private business has a snow-
ball’s chance of survival in
hell if it employs the number
of ineffective and unproduc-

Any private business will go

present its Board with an

its mistakes.

ALLOW us this opportunity to
air our views about the Minis-
ter of Education, Nahas An-
_gula, with reference to his
speech to Nantu delegates at a
- congress recently.
It seems to me that our
Minister is under the illusion
that all is well in his Ministry.
I personally feel he should
become more involved with
the problems besetting the
teaching profession, such as
the lack of facilites and ac-
commodation, rather than just
cniticising the teaching corps.

We all know that he was in
exile for 30 years and that the
situation in Namibia is new to
him. We do not blame him for
that, but in order to get his
pnonties nght he should at
least listen with an objective
attitude.

The past colonial occupa-
tion was known for its injus-
tice and discrimination (where
large amounts of money was
spent on education for whites)
and the imbalance is still in
existence. Isreparable damr
has been done and nothing
been done yet to restore ux
balance.

Comparing our meagre sala-
ries to those of the secretaries
in his offices one comes to the
conclusion that their attitude
is the same as the former DTA
goverment.

The status of teachers is
definitely affected by their
working conditions, low sala-

teaching aids, books, proper

Most of the teachers are also
parents - they also need cloth-

hostels, and fees. As govern-

INOTICE from the Windhoek
Advertiser of January 22 that
Telcom is going private.
Hopefully this will mean that
when placing telephone direc-
tory and yellow pages entrics

we can in future deal with a
Namibian company instead of
Maister Directories from Cape
Town. .

When I look at the amount I
pay each month for directory
entries and extrapolate that
across the board, it is apparent
that our directory and yellow
pages must be worth millions.
Perhaps the Postmaster Gen-
eral or the responsible Minis-
ter could, therefore, advise:

- Why a company which
operates from Cape Town and
which does not even have an
office in Namibia and which
does not employ Namibians,
bat send their own people up
from Cape Town for about two
months every year, have been
given this very hicrative con-
tract?

- Whether Maister Directo-
nes pay tax in Namibia on
what they carn here?

- If not, why not?

- If the contract is awarded
on a tender basis, with privati-
sation will the directly con-
tract be thrown open to tenders
from local businessmen who
can then éstablish an office
here, employ Namibians, pay
taxes and generally benefit our
country as a whole?

I ask these questions as it
seems that Maister Directo-
nes; have had this contract for
many, many years and it has
never been awarded to anyone
else.

With independence, we nast
now stand on our own two feet
and do away with foreign
companies who literally take
the money and run back to
Cape Town. We must estab-

lish local businesses employ-
ing local people. Giving the
directory /yellow pages contract
to a Namibian will be a step in

the right direction.

I look forward to hearing
what the powers that be have
to say.

Still imbalances

1 WOULD like to register my
concern on the matter of Gov-
¢erament houses. The -state of
affairs conceming official ac-
commodation for civil servants
cannot continue as in the past.
Something must be done now.
The Honourable Minister of
Works, Transport and Commu-
nication, you are the only one
who can sec to it at this stage that
our people get what we deserve.
Justice must be practiced with
the allocation of accommoda-
tion for all civil servants. Blacks
are also civil servants and can
also live in these houses now
(which was not the case in the
past). Some believe it is still the
._-gpse because they serve as key

j-most of which are

country.

Comrade Minister, I am con-
vinced that you, as a freedom
fighter, have not forgotten the
imbalances in the rural areas that
are still as they were in the past.
Windhoek inclusive, there are
some houses mainly reserved for
white colleagues (obviously
those in a good condition) and
certain houses fit for blacks
only.

Comrade Minister, we would
like your Ministry to see to it that
the structures according to
which these housing committees
are established, be reviewed, so
that black observers be replaced
and whites be transferred to a
rehabilitation centre.

We need civil servants in our
towns who can re-shape the
status quo.

Officials in Keetmanshoop
even claim that some houses are
reserved for up to three months.
One wonders for whom? Offi-
cials in Rundu, Oshakati, and
Ondangua and other smaller
towns confirm their situation is
similar. I asked some black civil
servants why they didn't apply

for these open houses after they
had worked more than six years
for the government? And their
Tesponse was that they were told
there were no houses available.

If there is no response from
the Ministry concerned, I am
prepared to provide the Prime
Minister’s office with the facts
so that he can come to our res-
cue. We don’t necessarily just

want to replace white adminis-

trators with black ones, but we
would like to see the colonial-
minded whites leave.

Talso hear that whites are now
moving from old-fashioned
houses to newer ones and this
seems to be a strategy planned to

Student bursaries

TAM very disappointed by the
Ministry of Education and Cul.
ture. 1 am one of those students
in the University of Namibia
who wants to study further both
for myself and the development
and building of the Namibian
nation.

I have applied for bursaries
from the Ministry of Education
and Culture. They sent me a let-
ter of inquiry in which they
asked me to provide them with
Std 10 results, but at that time the
results were not yet released.
They then told me that they don’t
have the course I have chosen
although they had sent applica-
tion forms and booklets to the
school which stipulated the
course in question. Until today |
have had no feedback. I am at
present attending lectures but |
don’t know whether I will get the
bursary or whether I will have to
leave. My parents are very poor
and cannot afford the fees. The
fees, including hostel and meals
plus courses, are about R11 000.

Not many people can afford to
pay this sort of amount.

We students of the Academy
urge the government to consider
this matter. About two-thirds of
the students here don’t have
bursaries and are still waiting for
answers because they have ap-
plied.

We will go on strike unless
something is done.

THROUGH the medium of

We then had to arrange

sad! If only it were an iso-

we all know it 1s not so,
because many of us have
had to contend with cases
of a similar nature ourselves.

In this area, the botsotsos

I am not advocating any

ngDK9b586DUL7EUbqEM36MKEHEcStLqcSDVn7HKb,"Not a waste

PLEASE allow me space in
your esteemed newspaper to
air my views on what seems to
be a controversial issue - the
purchase of a Presidential jet
estimated to cost R80 million.

I would at the outset like to
state that acquiring a plane for
the country is in no way a
waste of resources consider-
ing the fact that this plane is

going to be used for transport-
ing the President and his en-
tourage to various parts of the
globe to canvass for much-
needed assistance that our young
and fledgling nation will re-
quire from time to time.

On top of that the jet will not
be used for the President's
private purposes but rather for
purposes beneficial to the
development of Namibia and
its people. Obviously when the
President is not travelling the
aircraft will be used commer-
cially, thus bringing in addi-
tional revenue for the state. As
opposed to the chartered plane
which is costing the govern-
ment and the taxpayer, if you
like, thousands, if not millions
per day? Therefore the pur-
chase of an executive jet is a
cost-saving exercise rather than
an unwanted and unwarranted
expenditure as some of our
countrymen tend to believe, |

Painstakingly, those Oppos-
ing the idea are mostly those
responsible for the misery and
poverty of Namibians and
suddenly and ironically are
today ‘championing’ the ‘cause’
of the disenfranchised com-
munity hence the unofficial
spokespersons of these people.
This is sheer hypocrisy. There
are those who maintain that
the acquisition is untimely
because of the drought situ-
ation in our country. Well and
good. That the country is
drought-stricken is a reality too
obvious to be missed even by
the Government. To be realis-
tic the Government is in no
way ignoring this problem and
instead it has announced emer-
gency measures in a bid to
address and thus arrest the situ-
ation!

Concomitantly, to my own
understanding and belief, the
President had to charter a plane
to go to Iran - to name but one
country - where he won a deal
to supply the Iranians with beef
in exchange for oil which (the
beef) otherwise could have
flooded the local market, thus
forcing the drought affected
farmer to sell it below market
pnices.

In anutshell, Iam just trying
10 appeal to my countrymen
and women not to criticise
everything left, nght and centre
just to let themselves be heard,

but should rather be objective
and constructive,

I realise that there are those
who have their own political
agenda (perhaps a hidden one)
and who will try to frustrate
the efforts of the new dispen-
sation in order to win some
political votes, but acquiring a
plane which is obviously going

stating that the country lives

one more question: Did the
Honourable Ministers of Trade
and Industry and Finance voice
their strong objections against
tbe purchase of the Presidea-
tal plane for R80 million?

The question to be asked in

this regard, and which has not
been touched upon by either
the press, the Prime Minister,
State House or the Ministry of
Works, is whether it is cheaper
to buy a Presidential jet for
R80 miilion instead of charter-
ing planes? Why did State House
not come up with facts and
figures to silence the critics?
The reason is simple: they
cannot, because itis cheaperto
charter planes ghan to buy one

hundreds of thousands of Rands
a year to operate and maintain
It.

Honourable Mimsters of
Trade and Industry and Finance,

tions in order to start a verture.

Against this background,

‘al profits (before tax) of
Ro million for each of these 80
companies are not out of reach.
At a corporate tax rate of 42
+ cent, the taxman would
collect R67,1 million from the
80 ventures annually, and ad-
ditional reverme from personal
income tax. If every one of the
80 companies creates 50 job
opportunities, 4000 people
would find work and income
in order to support an addi-
tional 12 000 to 16 000 people,
such as family members.
Economic and industrial
development is what this cour-
try desperately needs,,Honour-
able Members of the Cabinet,
pot lwanous jets for the po-
litical elite. And nobody should
bide behind the statement, that
the cost for the plane is met by
French development aid. Lf this
is the case, it is, indeed, strange
what some people perceive to
be development aid. Aid of
this nature does not contnbute
towards the development of
the nation, but contnbutes
towards the creation of a new
elite. As such, aid of this na-
ture should be rejected with
the contempt it deserves. By
this way, I am sure that the
French public would not con-
done aid of this nature. After
all, it is their tax money with
which the jet is paid for.

In a bitter and protracted
struggle we successfully fought
against the old elite. However,
thousands of brave Namibian

elite establish itself to live in

ANON

The jet outcry

IT has never been part of my

culture to engage myself in
public debates which are being

over-emphasised for political
gain.

In the face of the out-of-
proportion criticism about the
plan to purchase an R80 mil-
lion jet for the Government
and officials of the Republic
of Namibia, I was faced with
several questions which I could
not help to answer.

I fully concur with the fact
that our country faces numer-
ous problems, some short term
and others long term. Take
for example the drought,
hunger and unemployment
which are nowadays the fo-
cus issue of those who are
opposed to the purchase of
the plane.

Now the question is whether
it is true that those ‘Muyon-
gos’ who presuppose that the
R80 million could have been
better spent if used for relief
programmes, are more sensi-
tive to the realities in Na-
mibia? If so, how far back
have they (Muyongos) been
so critical about the way in
which taxpayers’ money has
been spent for the purchase
of things such as Casspirs and
Mirages by their regime, the
former interim government?

Or, does Muyongo want us
to believe that the money mis-
used on the purchase of war
material at the time of their
rule was less than R80 mil-
lion? And was it not taxpay-
ers’ money?

This country has inherited
a debt which it has to repay
due to the misuse of funds
and the criminal war which
was imposed on our people.
Again, does Muyongo want
us to accept that the drought
and other social evils in our
country today are new hap-
penings? I assume not.

Unemployment, hunger, to
mention but a few, are the
legacy of the past history of
the country. Even at the time
of successive colonial regimes,
the problems were there.

As these problems did not
prevent them (the Muyongos)
from purchasing wanton war
materials which ran to bil-
lions of Rands which this
country is left to repay today,
likewise, should these pre-
vent the legitimate govern-
ment from purchasing a plane
which will enable the Presi-
dent and other Government
officials to maintain contacts
with the outside world for the
benefit of the people of this
country?

‘ Bven if the plane were not
purchased, could there be
someone who would come
up with a formula which would
serve .aS a means through

which the R80 million would
have been better spent?

How many foreign compa-
nies have been offered op-
portunities to invest in this
country? And the shocking
result is often that instead of
employing Namibians, they
either bring in their own
employees (foreigners) or they
simply amass huge profits for
themselves and transfer the
monies out of the country after
having paid the locals poorly, -
something which is tanta-
mount to exploitation.

The logic of buying a plane
for the State is explicitly clear
and it must not merely be
opposed for the sake of op-
posing.

Mr Muyongo, sir, being in
the opposition does not nec-
essarily necessitate you to op-
pose every undertaking of the
government. It rather requires
you to show the people of this
country that you have the abil-
ity to be an alternative gov-
ernment in the future - some-
thing which your colleague
Dirk Mudge and his Party,
the DTA, have already been
proved wrong by the major-
ity of the people of this coun-
try.

Confusions

FROM my point of view as
an entrepreneur, I do not agree
with the statement of the new
Namibian National Chamber
of Commerce and Industry
(NNCCI) in connection with
the plane for the President
(The Namibian, May 12). I
got annoyed. How is it pos-
sible that such an organisa-
tion which claims to repre-
sent the private sector, can
make such confusing utter-
ances?

I went to the NNCCTI to dis-
cus this matter and to ascer-
tain whether the newspaper
report was a true reflection of
the original statement. This
was confirmed and I was told
that the comment was also
meant to challenge people and
to elicit a reaction.

During my discussion with
the General Secretary of the
NNCCI I then raised the fol-
lowing points:

They believe that the R80
million invested in the plane
will bring about more bene-
fits than disadvantages. But
the NNCCI cannot support
that statement with a compre-
hensive evaluation of the facts.
That should have been done
to avoid the perception that
the NNCCI is flattering the
government.

Without doing its home-
work, the NNCCI should avoid
to criticise publicly its own
members or organisations eli-
gible for membership.

They accuse the private
sector of not having addressed
its responsibility where in-
come-generating is concerned.
Thus the government needs
the plane to look for sources"

AFTER a silence of nearly
one year we have decided
to inform you again about
the tournsm situaton in
Kaokoland and other related
matters.

The destruction on all
levels is getting more in-
tense every day. One of the
biggest contribuung factors
are the two articles that were
published last year in Get-

ism in SA. Extra car tracks,
fire places, rubbish and a
direct interference with the
lives of local people are but
a few senous problems. Is
there any control to deter-
mine the number of cars
entering the area and do the
authorities know whether
these visitors follow the basic

are not enough. Construc-
tive planning on all levels is
required to save this area.
Are you, as a Namibian,
satisfied that this unique
ecosystem gets trampled by
cars? Is it acceptable that
the people of this area get
exploited and disgraced by
people who do not care for
them, but see them most of
the time as primitive and
lazy?

If the government does
not take a positive attitude
towards the future of this
area, very soon you might
find that the socalled ‘last
wildemess’ has changed into
the lost wilderness. There is
no doubt in my mind that no
senior official in the depart-

have the privilege to make
money out of an exclusive
area while other operators
who can give the same serv-
Ice are neglected? We more
than once offered to stay
within all rules applicable
to this area and also to pay ;
concession fees. Why can
people from this country not
visit the area just because it
is too expensive. There are
operators in this country who
can give the same service at
half the present fly-in price.
To allow two or three op-
erators in the area can only
mean more money for tour-
ism in this country. Why
the blatant favouritism? The
night to enter the area cer-
tainly cannot belong to one
person only and if that is the
case then the system in this
area 1S cormpt.

As a taxpayer of this
country I am certainly en-
titled to know what conces-
ston fees are paid yearly for
this big area.

Is the present concession
still valid? It was clearly
Stated in early 1991 that the

concession would be temni- |

nated on 31 December 1991
and thereafter it would be
decided what to do with the

area. After six months it is
sull the same operator. What
is happening to honesty and
integrity?

What is the present state
with regard to the western
part of Kaokoland being
declared as a nature reserve
area?

Why do the authorities
openly allow the wide-scale
smuggling of liquor in
Kaokoland (and other ar-
eas)? For a group of tourists
to encounter drunk people
at villages cannot be to the
advantage of tourism inthis J).
country. Is this smuggling
within the law of the coun-
try?
The public have the night
to know what is going on
when it comes to matters of
general importance. This
beautiful country belongs to
all Namibians and we cer-
tainly have a right of en-
tmace into certain areas,
especially when there is more
than just the one option |
available.

Why does everybody at
the moment close theireyes
to the problems of Kaokol-
and? Is it ignorance or what
1s the problem?

Your comments as a reader

are appreciated. It can only
help for better understand-
ing ifa senior official in the
department can give us

swers to these problems.

Mixed feelings

I WISH to react to the socal-
led Okahandja Doclaration
which was read to the audi-
ence who gathered at the All
Herero Cultural Memonal Day
in Okahandja recently.
While I wholeheartedly
support the cultural gather-
ing of that nature, I have re-
ceived the declaration with

mixed feelings hecause many
of those who claim to be
Sympathetic to the repatria-
tion do so in order to reap
massive harvests as they have
done in previous times. For
instance, the same messiahs
went to Botswana and col-
lected money and Lister en-
gines on the pretext that such
engines would be installed in
boreholes drilled for them by
the colonial administration in
Namibia and to date we do
not know the whereabouts of
these engines and the moncy
In addition some Batswana
nationals were accused of
having engaged lawyers in
order to block the repamia-
tion and hence each of those
who wanted to be repatnated
were asked to contribute a
specific amount so that they
could engage lawvers to ef-
fect their repatnation. From
the moncy collected, people
ennched themselves by pur-
chasing farms and buying
houses. I be beve vou will agroc
with me when I sav money 1s
collected. but notto the hene-
fit of those supposed to make
a living. An example is the
appeal made to Herero people
here and abroad to make
conations to build a decent
house for their paramount
chief. This received a posi
hive response but to date
Hereros hear that the house
was built by the colonial
administration with taxpay-
ers money which means the
house is a government house.
We have no legal claim to it
although we contnbuted

_ money to build it.

] want to send a strong appeal
to foreign mussions and the

Government of Namibia to
see to 1 that this illegal col-
lection of money and mate-
nal equipment by the socal-
led messiahs is brought to an
end with immediate effect.
Finally I appeal to the same
government and non goverm-
ment organisations to chan-
nel their assistance through a
body worked out by those who
want to be repatriated and that
body or association be regis

' tered and recognised by both

Detainees respond

THE New Era of November
12-18 published a letter froma
certain Shoye Sheya (Oshakatt)
under the heading ‘Detainees
debate irks reader’.
The letter is characterised
‘by outdated rhetoric and not
only aims at disgracing the status
of the former Swapo detainees
but to stir hatred and blood-
shed among Namibians. It is
. | incomprehensible how a news-
, | paper wholly funded by the
y taxpayer can descend that low
and spread such sick Views.
: Mr Sheya and New Era writes,
| | among others, that ‘the former
South African agents must bear
in mind that it was not Swapo
which sent them to spy in the
_ | organisation’. The letter fur-

ther portrays the Swapo de-
tainees as having been respon-
sible for the deaths of many
Namibians through ‘treacher-
ous ways’.

It must have been during
such a time that Jesus Cunst
shook his head and said ‘Lord,
forgive them, for they don't
know what they are doing ..’ It
is a sad case. Yet, we shall

r | forgive the naive ‘revolution-
. | ary’ Shoye Sheya. But the
; | Shoyas and the New Eras should
be taught to understand our
bitterness.

Let us start with the basics.
The former Swapo detainees
are also former freedom fight-
_ | ers. and many are former Plan

combatants. When the heroic

exploits of Plan fighters and

| the herculean efforts of Swapo
diplomats, nurses, teachers,
mechanics ... will be reflected

- | inthe history books, many ¢x-
i | Swapo detainees will be there.
, |. Yes, the Swapo ex-detainees
+~| and indeed those still being
mmmcatdined by Swapo, are made
menor possibly the finest sons

detainee. For a moment they
remember the past, you know
those old days, and lock in a
warm embrace.

Then, usually the former de-
tainee becomes bitter and the
Swapo looks down or starts
crying in despair.

There were and are still many
such episodes. During such
times, the sympathisers of the
ex-detainees ask in wonder how
1s it possible you can embrace
your tormentor. I am sure the
Shoyes in turn ask the com-
rades how he/she dare embrace
a ‘spy’. Those who were not
there will not understand many
things.

Certainly it must be mind-
boggling to Shoye how those
very ‘traitors’ are allowed to
occupy top positions in gov-
ermment and how they are

There is no such thing as

> | us take a simple example. See
two very persistent persons
fighting. They fight and fight
and never listen to reason as
each hopes to deliver the final
knockout blow.

Naturally exhaustion sets in
and each realises a knockout is
wishful thinking. At that stage

' | the simplest gesture can stop
the fight and the two will never
again be the same. For one,
they start to respect each other,
then they tolerate each other.

Reconciliation, on the other

Its actions since inde-

speak of a positive com-

country and its people. It
certainly does not want

Atits annual congress
in August the NAU ac-
cepted the principle that
livestock values should
be adjusted and that ag-
ticulture should be
treated equally to other
sectors. The congress
however felt that the
unique situauon of the
farmer (commercial as
well as communal)
should be taken inlocon-
sideration and that only
realised profits should be
taxed.

Can you expect farm-
crs, who made no profits
due tu the drought situa-
tion, to pay taxes on the
increased livestock val-
ues and still survive?
Also, what about their
dependents, those who
have worked on their
farms for years? If the
concerned farmers hav:

is one of the biggest em-

unfair to link this matter
to the past, as Mr Sievers
has stated: “They no
longer deserve privileges
or sympathy, It is now
for them and not the tax-
payers, to bear the con-
sequence of their negli-
the past”.

Let us assure Mr
Sievers that the commer-
cial farmers are commit-
ted to this country and its
people and would not like

to lay claim to anything —

at the expense of any
person or sector. And
they are taxpayers as
well.

Really, fellow
Namibians ..
AS a concerned tax-

payer and Namibian,
what! would like toknow
iS!

Before being moved
what was Mr Mubita
doing in addition to Talk-
ing Point? And what was
he getting paid for it?

Surely, also, it was Mr
Mubita who created the
storm around himself.

At the end of the last
Talking Point he pre-
sented, it was Mr Mubita
himself who announced
the news that he was off
the show, and the same
Mr Mubita who said that
Talking Point was being
taking off the air “by a
small minority”.

From what we heard
later, this was very far
from the truth. Indeed Mr
Mubita was being moved
or sent for training or
whatever, but from the
official statements there
apparently had never
been any plan to take
Talking Point off the air.

SO, we must ask our-
selves then, what was Mr
Mubita trying to do?

On another level,
surely some sort of ac-
tion should have been
taken against him for

_ deliberately passing on

WE AS students at the
Okalongo Senior Pri-
mary School would like
to raise our problems to
the Ministry of Educa-
ion as well as to the pub-
lic at large.

- There is no order at
our school especially in
grades 8-10;

- teachers are wasting
taxpayers money - they
attend only two lessons a
day then wait for their
Salaries;

- some subjects are
taught by inexperienced
teachers which results in
failures for most students
at the end of the day,
especially Grade ]Ocan-
didates;

- the inspector does not
consult students on their
problems when he visits
the school;

- the principal is ap-
pointing unqualified
teachers while qualified
ones are being chased
away; |

- tribalism is growing
rapidly as most
Ovambadjas as being ap-
pointed regardless of
their qualifications.

Therefore we are urg- |

whose only claim to fame
was that she was an Amen-

son was Ms Melissa
Bruemmer, a friend of
Katyavivi’s who atthe time

did not even sit one day in

for Unam, was paid US$12

I stayed on as director of

there is an illusion that
financial retums from
lotteries and other forms
of gambling will provide
a much-needed source
forrevenue. The fact that

forlegalisation of lotter-

ably be wrong, especially
when it ignores the ex-
perience of history. Fur-
thermore, itcan be read-
ily demonstrated that lot-
teries are an uneconomi-
cal way to raise money.
A good example can be
obtained from Ireland.
The total income from
the Irish hospitals from
the Irish sweepstakes,
counting all money now
gathered in Canada, the
US, Britain and else-
where, amounts to about
four million dollars a
year. This is less than
the 19 per cent of the
money paid by those who

The legalisation of the
institution of gambling
weakens the basic
premise of the good so-
ciety, namely the Chris-
tian and humanitarian
conceptof social respon-
sibility for one’s neigh-
bour.

Namibia being a pre-
dominantly Christian
community, I believe it
is a Christian duty to
take unto one’s self the
need for one'sneighbour
instead of taking from
him.

Reporting From Dr Tjingaete

IFOUND your editorial
comment “A call for
more productivity” in
which the report of the
Auditor-General tor the
financial year ending
March 31 1993 to be
most tHluminating

Vhere are a number of
points which [ beheve
deserve further com.
ment.

Firstly, a person who
should be ‘independent
and objective’ should use
such expressions which
reflect his or her obyec-
tivity.

The Auditor-General
has created for himself a
problem of expression
for future reports.

The use of expressions
as ‘culprits’, ‘fraud 1s
rampant’, ‘outstanding S
& TE allowances have
reached alarming pro-
porbons’, ‘chaotic fash-

ion’ as these terms are
all relative to one of de-
gree and substance

For instance, the ¢x-
pression ‘rampant’ 1s
used denoting that a situ-
ation has arisen where
the incidence ot fraud
has reached uncontrol-
lable (mass or mob) pro-
portions and the perpe-
trators thereof are doing
tin an aggressive and
defiant manner.

The Ministry of For-
eign Affairs 1s one of
those singled out where
traud 1s rampant.

Now when one checks
the AG’s own comment

under ‘Auditor opinion’
on page 86 of the report,
reference is only made
to one incident of thelt,
in| which Zambia
Kwacha were stolen and
on page 96 under
subparagraph 3.7.7.2.
‘Fraud'theftumisuse of
government property
and manpower’ the Au-
ditor-General himself
reports: “Nothing in this
regard was reported to
me by the accounting
officer nor were any de-
tected during the verifi-
cation of annual report
informauon.”

Come on Dr Tyingaete,

be farr. does this add up
to rampant fraud’ orare
you guilty of using your
independent office to at-
tack the Minister of For-
eign Affairs because he
dared to criticise you?
This surely seems to
be the case as you ven
disappointingly on page
3 question the right
privilege of cerainmem-
bers of the National As-
sembly to do what they
are appointed to do and
that tS to question the
acts, atutudes and com-
ments of any person
which they regard appro-
priate lo raise in purlta-

ment

Yoursensitivity to this
Situalon suggests vou
are not able to take erit-
cism (which you must
accept as part of the
democratic process) but
you feel free to criticise
others in a subjective
fashion, whereas your
high office calls for a
clear head and objective
reporting

allel of your comments

ngIP2E283JfQsJZWvI305RPXMJBXyQvFXJgssMPW,"Gathemann to be preserved

THE letter ‘Call to resist
Sanlam’s plans’ published
in The Namibian of Sep-
tember 23 contains fac-
tual mistakes and
muspercepuions. Kindly
allow us to clarify the
matter.

|. There is no question
whatsoeve, that the
Gathemann and
Kroonprinz buildings in
Independence Avenue
will be ‘destroyed’. To the
contrary, these two his-
torical buildings will be
retained in full, and not
only the facades. Instruc-
tions to this effect have
been given to the archi-
tects. Because the design
poses a tremendous chal-
lenge to the architects, we
were not in a position to
supply The Namibian
with final architectural
drawings at the time of its
report on the 21st which

would have prevented the
unfortunate assertion
“that the plan seemingly
violates historical monu-
ments legislation”.

2. We agree whole-
heartedly that these two
buildings are “not useless
artifacts but working
buildings”. That is why
they will be retained in
full. Insofar as it is neces-
sary, the buildings will be
renovated, repaired and
maintained to remain
‘working buildings’ and
simultaneously be a valu-
able tourist attraction and
an aesthetical asset to the

city. Sanlam has a proud
track record of its devel-
opments being sensitive
to historical, aesthetical
and ecological factors.

3. Thirdly, we would
like to clarify the asser-
tion that Santam 1s a ‘for-
eign developer’. The de-
velopment is an invest-
ment of Namibian funds
on behalf of the thousands
of policy-owners, pension
fund, medical aid, unit
trust and other financial
service clients of the com-
pany in Namibia. As a
mutual company, Saniam
has no shareholders: all

its assets belong to its cli-
ents. Apart from our obli-
gation to earn optimal re-
turns for our clients, it is
our policy to support these
clients and communities
by means of projects and
investments that would
benefit that particular
community. We evaluate
possible investment
projects on an on-going
basis, and would like to
support our clients in other
centres in Namibia as
well.

4. Also in the wider
context, the city and the
country as a whole stand

to benefit in terms of the
employment created and
by way of taxes paid to
the city and the state. As
far as possible we make
use of local labour, local
matenal and local contrac-
tors. Apart from this im-
portant contribution to the
economy, our primary
duty as property investors
is the creation of commer-
cial accomodation. There
is a lack of A-grade of-
fices in Windhoek, as is
bore out by the fact that
the Sanlam centre in In-
dependence Avenue has
been fully let since it was
officially opened by Dr
Libertine Amathila on
October 12 1990.

ALLOW me to express the feelings of ruling party
Members in your newspaper. We in Swapo are
committed to democratic principles and therefore
Swapo ts calling on registered voters to exercise
their democratic nghts to vote in the coming general
elections.

We are not campaigning fora two-thirds majority
but for the overwhelming majority to rule this
country. Itis nota seeret that we are ruling, and we
have and will continue to rule Namibia according to
the democratic structures put in place by Swapo.

We in Swapo believe and know that democracy
will stay forever in this country.

Other parties have often relied on tribalism and
racism to promote their cause and they therefore can
claim to represent Namibia as a whole. It should
therefore be a wonder that Swapo has provided four
and a half years of peace and tranquility in Namibia.

We live in peace today because of the commit-
ment of Swapo to seck unity in diversity in our
country.

In spite of the fact that some opposition parties
have insulted S wapo leaders personally, itis Swapo’s
leadership and maturity that has never wavered
from the commitment to freedom of speech.

In the past years Swapo has committed itself to

nation-building, knowing that Namibians deservea
government that has priorities as they do. The
Swapo leadership has ensured development and
they also believe there must be contact between
government and people at all levels. That 1s why
Swapo has branches and sections at grassroots
level.

The Foreign Investment Act was passed, which
regulates the framework tor foreign investors. In-
come tax was reduced twice. Job creation was one
of the top priorities.

In the next five years Swapo’s priority will be to
secure existing jobs and create new ones. For exam-
ple the Free Trade Zone will create more Jobs for
Namibians and that is part of Swapo’s priorities for
the next five years.

Tourism will be expanded and housing, water,
electricity, education, health, agriculture and fish-
eries will be promoted.

Therefore in the next five years Swapo will accel-
erate change by creating new opportunities for
Namibians through economic growth, better educa-
tion and health services and more Jobs.

for official’s

‘fondling’?

WOMEN'S Solidanty was shocked
to her that Mr Vero Mbahurua was
recently found guilty of sexual moles-
tation in Canada while representing
Namibia on an official visit. We were
even more hormfied to read tn The
Namibian of November 3 that Mr
Mbahurua was quoted as saying that
in his culture it is not an offence “to
fondle someone”. We would like to
make several points about this inci-
dent.

1. We often hear similar ‘cultural’
arguments applied to issues involving
women. There are ‘cultures’ in Na-
mibta which have endorsed racism in
the past but this is never accepted as an
argument for aquiescence to contin-
ued racism. By the same token, ‘cul-
tural’ beliefs are no argument for con-
tinucd sexism.

Furthermore, we wonder whose
‘culture’ Mr Mbahurua had in mind.
We suspect that ‘his culture’ means
the attitude of the men he knows,
because we know of no Namibian
women who agree to be treated as
sexual objects against their will.

2. Every ‘culture’ in Namibia ts
subject to the Namibian Constitution
and the laws of the land. Our Consti-
tution forbids sex and race discrimi-
nation and guarantees human dignity
to all persons, male and female, black
and white.

Article 19 ofour Constitution, which
covers cultural freedom, clearly states
that people in Namibia have cultural
freedom subject to the condition that
they do not violate the terms of the
Constitution or impinge upon the rights
of others,

Hf the incident. in question had taken
place in Namibia, we would have ad-
vised the woman to lay a criminal
charge of assault or indecent assault,
“Fondling” a woman without her con-
sentis justas much acrime in Namibia

as itis in Canada.

We hope that Government officials
do not think that they are exempt from
our Constituuon and our laws - no
matter what their ‘culture’, they are
Namibians and they have a duty to
obey our laws. Mr Mbahurua, as a
legal advisor, should know better.

3. According to the report in The
Namibian, Mr Mbahurua’s fine was
paid by the Commonwealth Parha-
mentarians’ Association and was re-
funded by the Namibian Government.
Why ts this? Was fondling a hotel
cleaner accepted as part of Mr
Mbahurua’s official duties? Are the
Namibian taxpayers expected to pay
for his disrespect for human dignity?

4. We would like to make a public
appeal to the Namibian Government to
take this incident very seriously. A
Government official travelling abroad
onofficial business represents Namibia
and everything Namibia stands for.
Women’s Solidarity would not like the
world to believe that Namibia is a
country where such behaviour is con-
doned or ignored.

We believe this offence calls for the
strongest public condemnation. We
also question whether a person who
shows such disregard for basic human
rights is worthy to act as a legal advi-
sor.

S. Finally we would like to applaud
the courage of the woman who laid the
charge against Mr Mbahurua in
Canada. It must nothave been easy for
a hotel worker to speak about against
such a prominent official, and we tind
this woman's example to be an inspira:
tion to us all,

We hope that the Government wall
keep the public informed about the
follow-up to this ugly incident.

The inhabitants of these towns face
a huge problem which ts the never-
ending small of what seems to be
human eacreta. The smell is worst in
the houses situated in the place known
as ‘Old Tamuariskia’.J want to ask the
Town Council of Swakopmund about
the removal of the controversial sew-
age dam from the middle of the resi-
dential area.

Asamatter of fact the former white
municipal council was blamed for
building the sewage dam among resi-
dences of the blacks. But after the
white council was voted out of power
and the current councillors vowed to
remove it if they were elected, noth-
ing happened.

It seems these were just empty
promises. The explanation that there
is Not enough money to remove the
sewage dam Is not fair as we pay our

rales and taxes as other home owners
and are entitled to breathe fresh air as
others do. Imagine waking inthe night
and tinding your house smells like
someone has just detecated on the
floor and after investigation you find
the whole house smells like that. It
might affect us in other ways too as we
are obliged to constantly use air fresh-
eners to make things bearable.At
present Swakopmund is undergoing
structural changes and the town will
receive tourists and would-be home-
owners and Fcan assure the Council no
one would like to stay in such condi-
vions.

Please convey my request to the
town council to look fora suitable site
to relocate the sewage dam - before
someone becomes sick and considers
claiming huge sums of money from

1 AM reterming to the
“dreamdeal’ clinched by
CDM with our peoples
government. ,
The more one takes
note of the persistent
inner issues of the deal,
the more Iam starting to
seriously question the
loyalty, ability and ca-
pacity of the Namibian
team of negotiators.
Considering the fact
that CDM, with its mo-
nopolistic conduct of
business, needed a part-
ner like the government
that would otherwise
sustain their dead end
track, why give intosuch
a lopsided arrangement?
Was the agreement
due to unfair composi-
tion of the negotiating
team or were favours

offered?

Both of these are valid
questions that need to be
analysed by the nation
as a whole. It 1s aknown
fact that Namibia, and
especially the inner cir-
cle of cadres considered
on the basis of their in-
volvement in the bush
struggle, does not offer
the depth and ability to
negotiate their win.

This no doubt leaves
the leadership with a
very slim base from
which to compile a
strong effective team that

could ensure a win-win
situation at all costs.

This, coupled with fi-
nancial favours, is some-
thing not new to CDM
operations and could
have been decisive fac-
tors in making the
Namibian team lose
sight... Why else should
they agree to aclause on
confidentiality and ex-
clusivity on sales.

How can we expect the
respect of the Namibian
nation by telling them
we are not going to let
them know anything at

all? Was this not why we
were fighting? Are we
doing this type of thing
because we consider the
intellectual and analyti-
cal capacity of our peo-
ple as zero?

We do not nced CDM
- CDM needs us.

The land is ours, our
great grandfathers and
grandmothers, the
Mandumes, Witbovis,
Kutakos and Morengas,
are the ones who sacri-
ficed for this land.

CDM has no right to
determine the terms - we

brought us to where we
are today.

Our priorities

IT seems for me to be the
time that the Government
puts the priorities of our
country night.

On the one side we have
problems with our budget.
We are dependent on help
from abroad. We are wait-
ing in vain for investments.
We are suffering from a most
serious drought ...

On the other side I learned

that the Government is in-
tending to buy a special

aircraft for the President and
nhisters at an amount of
R20 million. If One adds the

costs for maintenance, the

crew, fuels, landing charges
and others, the costs incurred
and to be paid by the tax-
payers will be around R30

million.

For those R30 million we

can buy:
* 1 million bails of lucerne;
or

* 43 000 t or 652 000 bags

of maize or

_ * 22 000 first class air tick-
ets for the State President, .

Ministers and other high
officials for a retour trip to
London, Bombay or New
York; or

* we can build approxi-
mately 5 000 core houses.

R30-million means R21
per capita or R200 for a
family with four children. It

a,

means RISO for each per-
som on work in the modern
sector OF approxumaeh
R550 for each revistered
taxpayer.

On the one side the State
President and his Ministers
used to remind us that we
must save, that we have to
work harder to be more
productive and to be less
luxurious on weekends ..

But on the other hand the
Parliament made acts by
which we enjoy today seven
more public holidays and
seven more yearly holidays
than in the past. Accord-
ingly, our productivity has
decreased by 6 per cent and
the costs of production have
increased by 4 per cent ...

What are our priorities
now?

arrested

* Be represented by an attorney at the (ax pay-

* Free food, clothing and medical care while in

* Plea bargain to a lesser charge. Often a

theft or burglary with the blessing of the judi-

* Appeal to higher courts to lighten their sen-

* Face financial ruin because of medical costs

* Receive counselling only when limited Gov-

PERMIE me space in vour newspaper to address
the Onbudsman, the supposed upholder of our
Constitution in respect of Natural Resources,

Sir,

After returning froma ten day holiday at the
coast, Lam of the opinion that you are not doing
your job, or rather, you are neglecting your
duties.

Let me be specific:

1. Damaging the Environment

When travelling between Okahandja and
Karibib, one cannot help noticing one heap after
the other of concrete boulders. ONE HEAP AF-
TER THE OTHER of unsightly rubble. Nobody
debates the necessity of building a fibreoptic line
to the coast for better communication.

Surely this is no excuse for destroying a besu-
tiful countryside with unsightly rubble.

I have taken time to investivate - near the
railway lines there are enough borrow pits of past

construction that serve no purpose.

With aloader and a truck, these heaps could be
removed and the holes filled - a dual purpose
served.

2 Empty bottles and bags

Travelling along the highways, one sees end-
less heaps of plass bottles, 99 per cent of them
non-returnable tin the desert we found only 4
returnable bottles, which we collected). Why is it
NOY possible to promulpate a law, making all
non-returnable fluid containers legal, or atleast
place a heavy tax on all these glass and plastic
containers.

It seems as if all partics concerned shun their
responsibility - firstly, the firm that is marketing
the product, secondly, the lezislator who is well
aware of the negligent attitude of the population
at large, thirdly, the Ombudsman who ls ulti-
mately responsible for the environment and
fourthly, cach and every member of the populu-
tion.

YVake time to look at the legislation of our so
often shunned neighbours and try to estabish

THE Ministry of Basic Education and Culture
recently printed a thick document advertising hun-
dreds of vacancies at schools in Namibia for 1998.
Is this not a waste of taxpayers’ money printing
such a big document whilst 90% - 999% of the
vacancies are already earmarked or reserved for
candidates? I do not think one needs to come up
with evidence since this is common knowledge
among all teachers and principals. How long will
we tolerate this? Even Nantu and TUN are aware
of corruption and nepotism at schools when it

comes to the appointment of teachers or their

promotion. Are the aspirant teachers not wasting

their time and energy by applying to fill a vacancy

Already Promised

which is already reserved for a specific person? If
these things are still happening when are we going
to start with the process of integrating teachers in
schools? In my understanding integration not only
means taking a black teacher to a white school but
also taking an Ovambo teacher to a Damara or
Nama school. Integration must take place between
Black and White and Black and Black. Fellow
Namibian teachers, let us fight the social evils of
nepotism, corruption and tribalism in Namibian
Schools with all the means at our disposal in order
to build a better education for our children

| CHOOSE to comment publicly on recent Cabinet
decisions concerning retirement benefits for senior
political office bearers and the reversal of salary
increments given to civil servants.

Many civil servants are already affected by the
latter as increments received since April 1997 are to
be recovered and salary notches reversed as Delore
date of increment.

The same Cabinet hired “financial experts” with
taxpayers’ Money to draw up the performance ap
praisal document and the WASCOM report prom:
ised a ten percent (10%) salary increase With effect
from | April 1997 and then kept sMent.

In my opinion the reason for such harsh decision
would be the unexpected ay aiability Of yobs for ex.

combatants inthe publig service, the recent demon:
stration by unhappy nursing staff or the unay atlabil-
ity of funds to finance the retrement benefits for
senior political office bearers. |

Cabinet agreed to“ gamble” without concem with
our pension fund which is our only benefit in the
grey-haired years ahead, yet they seem {0 be con:
cemed only about their retirement ycars.

Few elderly citizens in our beloved country sur
vive on pension-payouts by government al this mo-
ment but it does not concer the Cabinet members.

Unless the government comes clean on their dect-
sions I am of the opinion that civil servants In
Namibia are used to the benefit of their bosses and
that goes for every taxpayer in the Republic of
Namibia.

Names A Joke

THE proposal by the Windhoek Munici-
pality to name streets after musicians like
Louis Armstrong, John Coltane, Elvis
Presley and John Lennon, etc. is not only
laughable, but ridiculous.

How many Namibians have heard or ap-
preciated the music of these people? This
exercise is a waste of taxpayers’ good
money.

Africa has had great sons and daughters
who inspired the liberation of our conti-
nent and who deserve to be remembered:
Kwame Nkrumah, Kenneth Kaunda,
Julius Nyerere Albert Luthuli, Sekou
Toure, Agostino Neto, Hake Selassie,
Edwardo Mondlane, Patrice Lumumba,
Jomo Kenyata, Tafawa Balewa, Samora
Michel and Chris Hant to name a few.

John Lennon Street, Elvis Presley Drive,
Louis Armstrong Avenue is an insult to

our intelligence.

MAN appeared on earth approximately 3 million
years ago. The society in which the early man
lived, i.c. the primitive society or stone-age-socl-
ety was characterised by equal distribution of land
to all members of that society; land was never
tegardcd as the private property of a particular
person but was collectively managed by our ances-
tors. As a result of natural evolution the physicat
appearance of the carly man changed and simi-
larly, the classless ‘stone-age’ socicty was re-
placed by the “slave-ownership society.”

The “slave-ownership socicty” consisted of two
class i.¢ the slave-owners and the slaves. Some
members of this society contemplated ways of
enriching themselves, particularly means to im-
prove their harvest production. They concluded
that cheap labour and high output would achieve
that end, i.¢. slavery became a popularised and
profitable economic ideology and, for the first
time in human history, a man lost his land to
another man. The slave-ownership society was
later replaced by “feudalism” as a result of arevolt
of slaves against the slave-owncrs.

The “feudalism-system” or society was charac-
terised by more advanced economic development
A great thinker emerged from that socicty who
produced metal and steel tools which were used to
cultivate land and chop down trees for making
houses etc. He started to barter his products and
consequently assembled a vast fortune.

Because of his wealth he assumed the role of a
Hippocratic philosopher 1.c. by propagating to the
people that he was chosen by God (which explains
his wealth) and that he must be recognised by all
people of the Feudal-socicty as their king. This

parliament which consist of two houses ie. the
‘House of Lords’ and the ‘House of the Com.
mons’. The Feudal-Regime was eventually over.
thrown by the class of the landless who revolteg
against the king. The feudal-system was replaced
by a more advanced capitalist systenVsociety,

The capitalist society only replaced Feudal ex.
ploitation of the landless with its new method of
exploiting this class in its industries. The capitalist
society reached its success during the industrial
revolution, a period in which the capitalists be-
came the owners of all means of production, re-
sulting in a constantly growing demand for raw
materials. With this eracame more advanced means
of transport, powerful guns and technology. Gov-
emors and soldiers were then deployed around the
world to conquer various territories and its people,
inorder to exploit the raw materials and manpower
for their industries. The capitalists succeeded in
conquering termtories around the world and man
lost his land for the third time in history. Namibia
was not an exception in this regard.

I therefore sincerely to appeal to the land owners
in this country to consider their fellow landless
Namibians who are living in the iver beds and in
overcrowded unhygicnic conditions; to give them
a piece of land as this will create a better under-
standing amongst the people of our society, ime.
spective of the colour of their skins.

If | may quote Martin Luther King. “! have a
dream that one day the sons of former slaves and
sons of former slaves owners will be able to sit
down together at the table of brotherhood.”

IT would like to catend an appeal to the land
owners and the absentee landlords of Namibta to

voluntarily hand over part of their land to the
Jandless who are living in the corridors of our
country’s roadside and between the farms of the
landowners

I belicve that the day will come when my appeal
will be pul into practice. Our society remains
divided because ofthe unes en distribution of wealth
in this country between the haves and have nots.
Only when we can redistribute the land equally
will Namuibrans start to recognise cach others as
equal partners.

This in itself will solve the unnecessary present
and future land confrontation, und bury the in-
equality that is causing people to dislike cach

was a tuming point in the history of mankind and
is the reason why we have kings and queens today.

History teaches us that nobody was born a king
or selected by God to act as such. Aside from the
fact that the king enjoyed absolute power he also
had no respect for other people's territory or land
and, once again. man lost his ancestral land to
another person, The common people were re-
quired by law to pay tax by submitung a portion of
their harvest or products from the land which they
cultivated. This land was regarded as the private
property of the king. Consequently, with the ap-
pearance of classes the government was born.

In view of this the human society was divided

intotwoclassese.g. the aristocracy andtheclassof other.
the landless people. The class-struggle continued
with the landless demanding the return of their G HARRY

land. A good example of classes is the British WINDHOEK"

J REFER to the column “Ekse Kuume™ by
Nehumbilemo ya Ndakomantin The Namibian of
Fnday, Apmt 3, 1998
Asthiscolummn is probably read by many people |
cannot allow the writer to getaway with his unin-
formed remarks about the issuc such as cutting down
the Civil Semice Why does he feel that the opposi-
ton “are dying aslow, painful and ndiculous death?”
ltas ume people hke this columnist stop making such
unfounded and groundless remarks about the oppo
siuon when they clearly know nothing about whatis
happening in the polities of Namibia
The wnier goes on to tot out the hairy old argu:
ment about the opposition only knowing how to
cntucise but never providing any altematives. Allthis
serves to prove is that the wnter never reads hisown
or any other newspaper. The official opposition, the
DTA of Namibia, has provided plenty of alternatives
to, for example, the shocking overspending by the
government, the enormous size of the Cabinet, how
to solve the lands issue, and many other important
issues, but the writer clearly finds iLeasier just to go
along with the stream than to think for himself and
inform himself of what those altematives are.

This is shown by his infantile argument about why
the Civil Service should not be downsized. Where
does he think the money comes from to pay all those
civil servants? This is not a Socialist welfare state
where no one pays taxes and the state employs
everyone until the state is bankrupt. The taxpayers of
Namibia must provide the money to pay all the civil
servants, and there 1s not cnough moncy in Namibia

to support the civil ser tee
Only tthe government stops spending the tar pay-
cr money on unnecessan luxunes and produces a
Budeet which will stimulate the co anomy and boost
job creation will the people about whem the column:
ist chums to be concemed stop sutfenng. Their
suffering certainly cannot be alleviated by giving
them jobs in the Civil Sermice.
With regard to the Budget, the columnist should
inform himself to the fact that no one has to date said
a good word about it. The enticism levelled against
iwhas not come only from the opposition partes, but
also from every economist in Nanubia, including
those who suppor the mayomty party. These are
people who have made their mark in the private
sector, notthe civil service, and who understand what
it takes to make a country’s economy viable
1 believe that as a colummist in a widely read
newspaper like The Namibian, Mr ya Ndakomant
has a responsibility to his readers not to wnte so
thoughtlessly and utesponsibly about issues he clearly
does not understand or has not thought about prop-
erly. If he cares to visit the office of the DTA of
Namibia, we will be happy to inform him about the
many alternatives we have suggested, but which are
regularly wiped off the table in Parliament by Swapo’s
two-thirds majonty, which he no doubt helped to
elect.

I TAKE this Opportunity to praise Nahas Angula and Ya Kasita for
their insight into the financial strain that the current educational
system puts on parents. The Namibian of May 11 reported on the
Suggestions made by the two gentlemen in their respective Houses
with regard to tax rebates and exemption to parents who pay ie re!
children’s studies at the University of Namibia and other institutions
of higher learning.

ese government officials’ proposal is a testimony that they
mc oBnise the role played by Namibian parents in financing their
children’s ed

Furthermore, recognition of the burden that tuitio
many parents clear]
the masses,

n fees place on
y shows that Angula and Ya Kasita identify with

I patiently wait for these humane proposals to become a reality.

IF we were to spend our time worrying
about justice or the judicial system in
our country, which clearly sucks, |
swear many would have a nervous
breakdown.

Prisoners, in jails throughout the
county, are being treated like persons
who are not guilty of acrime. On top of
that they are given lenient sentences by
the courts.

The judicial system maintains that
pnsoners have their rights - something
which really baffles me. They (prison-
ers) are resting peacefully in jails be-
cause they know that the death sen-
tence has been abolished by the Na-
mibian constitution.

Of course rehabilitation pro-
grammes in jails are good and are
welcomed. However, the prisoners

must pay their dues for the crimes the

pnsons - sometimes while out on bail.
This does not make sense,

There are people in this country who
say that the high crime rate is caused by
unemployment. Can anyone prove that
rape 1s caused by unemployment? The
sooner we dispose of that ill-founded
idea the better. Let us Stop this ten-
dency, otherwise we are promoting
crime through unemployment. Notonly
do we find excuses for the culprits, we
also have to support them with our
hard-earned tax moncy.

The criminal disease is alive and well
in Namibia so let us combat it by find-
ing its cure. Let a team from govern-
ment, private sector and individuals
make Namibia a crime-free society.

I would like to meet the person or
persons who came up with the idea that

state of freedom from social |
order or security ina community”. People may be nich

but if there 1s no peace, this nauon is doomed.
The government and the people of this country must
work hand-in-hand for acommon goal: rebuilding and
development of the land - and put their social, reli-
gious and cultural differences aside. The government
which was elected by the people and which has armies,
bombs and other killing materials should not abuse the
national patriotism to oppress, harrass and persecute

those holding different political opinions.

People musthelp the government and pay their taxes
and, as the recipient of these taxes, the government
must construct roads and allow loans for agricultural
development.

As a woman, I see peace as a birthday cake. It takes
a lot of ingredients: patience and love. Peace is not
created by one person. A refugee woman is the target
of rape, violence, harassment, prejudice and mostly
the offenders go free, unpunished and ready to repeat
their offences. There is no tangible ‘piece’ of peacc.
Peace must be whole and enjoyed by all the people of
the country. Peace is a woman who needs to be taken

care of. Welcome Peace.

THE application for a licence by Quickjet Pty
Ltd serving before the Namibian Transport
Commission (NTC) presents an interesting op-
portunity to test the new leyislation passed at
the end of last year amending the Air Services
Act of 1948,

The new legislation specifically removes any
protection against competition for Air Namibia
and TransNumib.

The applicant viz Quickjet is a company
funded with private money and in no way relies
on government for financial ussistance. It is
backed by Namibian Harvest Investments, a
public company whose aim it is to empower
Namibians. It 1s unlikely that any other appli-
cation involving a similar amount of money
(N$1O million) will come before the NTC apain
In the near future.

While it is known that there is another airline
viz Kalahari Express that is also supposed to
serve the Fros-South Africa routes, this airline
has after some two vears not been able to start
operations and it in any case now resorts under
Air Namibia, a company making heavy losses
and becoming an increusing]s heavy burden on
the taxpayers. If Kalahari Eapress is to be run
by Air Namibia with the same degree of
unpunctuality and unreliability as its own serv-
ices then it is certainly in the public interest that
a privately funded airline be given an opportu-
nity to provide an alternative to the travelling
public.

It will be interesting to see how the NTC views
the Minister of Works Transport and Commu-
nications’ latest piece of Icgislation aimed at
making the transport sector more competitive
and less reliable on public (taxpayers’) money.

Free Water For Poor?

IS IT not time to look at the situation
where people are being denied commu-
nal water? How can we be unconcerned
when we witness this? Is itan acecpt-
able practice?

The unemployed in Namibia are a
common sight. They, like all of us, need
water. Must the unemployed die of thirst
or get water for free from poor homes
where they usually come from - the
owners of which must pay? Should we
not direct the employees who look after
our communal assets (Namwater) to
provide:

|) water to those who have paid (a

basic norm)
2) say five litres a day per person free

at each household point for instance’
Similarly a certain quantity tree to
schools and hospitals?

The community have a say in how our
assets should be run - parastatals admin-
ister Communal property and are not
paid badly for this work. Can you travel
freely on the road or pay poll tax, prac-
tised in some countries? Or walk for tree
on a lighted street? Or breathe the air
without paying some parastatal for 1
NamAir?

These are matters of common concern
and thus for common debate.

Walvis Youth Vow
To Tackle Crime

IT 1S Christmas and crime ts incteasing every where
in Namibia. The coast is the target of the robbers and
those attacking other people.

The reason is, there is only one Police vehicle to
assist about 5 000 people of Walvis Bay. The rest
have been damaged and in accidents. The Govern-
ment vehicles which have been in the country for
barely three years have been destroyed. Officials
are destroying whats purchased with our our tax
money, the violence ts increasing and we are with-
out transport

A week ago four men attacked an clderly person
in Walvis Bay) Three days after that a certain
businessman in Kuisebmond was assaulted in his
house The worstof alls that the Police renders bad
Service

The youth will not allow the elderly. bustnesses
and other people to be attacked in the streets tor
nothing. We, the youth, will take the law in ourown
hands and we will hit buck hard

We are directing a friendly request to the Govern-
ment, Police Commuisstoner and the Mayor, Mrs
Samaria, in Walvis Bay: stop the violence in Walvis
Bay, we are not atraid of tighting back, we are just
brought up well.

Every weekend someone 1s assaulted. We think
the Police station commander at Kutsebmond should
do something about that.

The only people who stop crime at Walvis Bay
are “Community against Crime’. Magnificent, guys.
we are proud of you. Mrs Samaria, bring more
vehicles and English-speaking Police to the police
stations so that we can just understand each other.

despite the hard times Air Namibia sul provided us

The cabin crew were friendly and assisted the

impressed with the service in the economy class,
which was so much better than other airlines tlying

However, it concerns me that the business class
section was nearly empty. J saw only three passen-

economy class were also emply. Many passengers
had a comfortable nights rest on three or four seats.

Thave been acivil servant for the past
eight years. Sometimes one feels so
down just at the thought that crvil serv-
ants do not get any increase or even a
bonus. We live far beneath the bread
line because of debts and no one thinks
of giving us an extra cheque to clear our
debts. We have to buy everything on
credit to try and survive because there
is Never any cash available.

As civil servants, we have only one
form of income and if we want to do
other business we first have to get per-
mission from the public service, and
then this income is also taxed IT gota
Wascom cheque of about NS9 000 last
year which was taxed to N$4.000. Why
can’t they tax these big cheques of the
leaders? This 1s very unfair toward the
ordinary worker.

You work for a month and at the end
of it, youdon’tevenhaveenough money

Test Politicians For HIV As Wel]

I READ with shock the Suggestion that couples who
plan to get mamed should be required to undergo HIV-
AIDS tests. I do not know why some political leaders
find it necessary to infringe on the private lives of some
people.

This suggestion comes soon after Government de-
cided to subject potential overseas students sponsored
by Governmenttoan HIV test. 1 agree thatitisexpensive
to transport a corpse from overseas or a physically
incapacitated Motswana when the test could have pre-
vented that.

I support this move because we are going through a
penod of economic hardships and need to save money.
But J am disturbed by the latest idea. If we are to do it,
we should start with politicians by asking them to
undergo an HIV test before they campaign for political
office because some of them are cared for by the state
and taxpayers’ moncy 1s spent to pay for their medical
expenses.

Theretore, if such leaders are not tested pnor to
attaining office, then the country can Incurexpenses that

KINDLY allow us space in your newspaper to air some
concems about matter that are of vital importance to
most Namibians. .

The Namibia People’s Social Movement with mem-
ber organisations in the building, manufacturing, whole-
sale, retail, motor car, fishing and banking sectors in
Namubia wish to denounce and reject the current in-
crease in the fuel price.

The exorbitant increases in the price of tuel that was
announced on September 14 2000 has caused stnkes
and hardships everywhere.

We wish to register our concerns that these increases
that were announced are not budgeted for in most of the
companies that have just allowed increases for work-
ers. These increases also are not calculated in the
inflation rate which employers are so keen to use to

increases.
It is extrémely difficult to create opportunities to
redress this in balsnog.that is now created by drastically

Wake Up NFA, For The Good Of Soccer

LET me ar my disappointment with regards to the
recent resignauon of Mr Dumitru as a result of what]
can call poor communication between him and the
NFA executive.

Firsuy I was disappointed by the feedback riven by
the president of the Namibia Football Association on
the might of June 26, which to me didn’t make any
sense :

He was arrogant and rude to the reporter. The NFA
president doesn’t have any natonal interest at hean
He thinks he can meas up and disorgantse Namibian
seccer with whatever knowledge of law he ROL to
promote himself but he should know that what he 1s
doing now 1s actually kalling our soccer.

How far do vou think we are going to goif we keep
on finng and hinng new coaches because you don't
want to help them the way they see how should the

navonal team should be ruled. How much moncy and
how many vears will it cost us to have our team
quah fied for Word Cup or even for the Afnean Cup of
Nauons.

Why should he side with a player (Nauseb)? I'm not
saying the punishment Dumsuu gave 1s jusufiable but
the NFA was suppose to show thei professionalism in
Unis Case. not to come on air and say: “I'm saying a
player must come back in to the team”.

Yes. we know hes valuable to the team butit’s high

ume that players started to become responsible, know-
ing that they are using up the taxpayers’ money and
there are also other players with potential who want to
play for the nauonal team.

Secondly, letme ask some quesuons on the national
soccer team. Look, we have many national teams here
in Namibia in different codes of sport. How many
mes has our soccer team left the country to play
fnendly matches with others eather in the SADC,
Africa or overseas? Answer: none Why? Answer: no
Money How are we suppose to get money? Through
sponsorship and tundraising events.

Having looked at all those questions I started to
doubt the competence of the NFA executive Are they
sleeping or what? When are we going to have our
soccer team tounng the world or Africa after 11 years
? You've heard the rugby team was in Argenuna, the
cricket team 1s in Canada, but what is wrong with the
football body?

So please letthe NFA answer these quesuons We, the
soccer lovers, we lost someone who knew and loved ine
game and had the potential to develop our soccer an

even to take us to the World Cup sunwery and |

ngDK1D788DKLnEULqEW5nMKEHDcStLqESDLnnHKL,"VAT Vendors Beware

COULD you please wam all registered
Value Added Tax vendors to beware of the
latest absurdity that the Receiver of Rev-
enue has come up with.

If your VAT payment 1s late or your
cheques bounces, then they enforce sec-
tion 68 (1) of the Value Added Tax Act
which states. “A person who fatls to pay
any tax payable under this act on or before
the due date for payment shall be lrable for
the payment of a penalty which 1s the
greater of an amount of N$100.00 for each
day dunng which the tax payment remains
outstanding” etc. This happened to achent
of mine who had to pay an amount of N$
1100.00 but forgot to sign the cheque that
he used for the payment. The cheque was
therefore refused by the bank and the Re-
ceiverclaimed inexcess of N$13000.00in
penalties as well as N$ 1800.00 in interest.
Well, this is where they are wrong.

If the officials from the Revenue offices
would take the time and effort and carry on
reading section 68 of the same Act, they

will notice under the same section, namely
subsecuon 2, i states quite clearly and |
quote: “The penalty imposed under sub-
section | shall not exceed the amount of
unpaidtax”, unquote. This means that when
a person owes NST 100.00, the maximum
penalty may only amount to N$1100.00.
Therefore, if a taxpayer fails to hand ina
Nil return, then no penaluies may be 1m-
posed.

I would be gratetul to your newspaper tt
these facts could be taken up with our
Receiver of Revenue and our readers ac-
cordingly informed. | wonder how many
taxpayers have already paid amounts in
excess of whatthey had to. The responsible
officer at the Receiver is a Mr. Kenny
Clocte. | attach copies of the relevant,
sections of the Value Added Tax Act.

How long have we been subject to unjustified

around the comer. Our Governmentin the [elecom-

lished in September 1999 recognised the tact that
competition will come for sure

Now at the workshop of May 29, nearby three
years after the Government policy 4s published,
the Legal Adviser of Telecom Namibia Ltd
pleaded for another exclusivity period for voice
telephony.

My very strong plea goes to the Hon Minister
Theo Ben Gurirab and the regulator. being the
Namibian Communications Commission, ty gn
ahead and open the telecommunications market tor
competition. Refuse to let the mighty Velecom Na-
mibia Ltd. once again bring toa halt the telecommu-

1992.

Telecom Namibia Ltd has had a period of ten
years exclusivity in which they had enough tune to
prepare themselves for operating ina free tai and

the current owner of
Kalkpan should not gain
from proceeds arising from
the sale of such farms bought
with funds sourced from tax-

Furthermore denying
such commercial farmers
compensation will serve as
a lesson to commercial
farmers who do not want to

ALLOW me to congratulate Minister Nangolo
| Mfbumba for producing a well-balanced and equila-

ble budget for the 2003-2004 financial year. Through
tis budger Goverment tried to put its moncy
_ where its mouth is.

The budget is so unassailable that even cnitics are

the raising of the tax threshold, the doing away with

the pension bachJog. the salary increase for public
sen ants. to mention but a few positives, the budget
gives an indication that Government is seriously
addressing the problems of poverty and the chronic
unequal drstnbutron of income that charactenses
this country. This is highly commendable.

Bs producing thus rood budget, Minister Mbumba
has now thrown the ball into the coun of the imple-
ments (the Permanent Secretaries of the various
ministries and the CEOs of parastatals) to see if for
a change they will assist Government to achieve its
deficit and debt targets through efficient spending.

On Acquired Expatriate
Dependency Syndrome

THE letter of M Makumbi
that appeared in your es-
teemed newspaper of March
18th, 2003 should not go
without comment.
lam an expatriate who
has been in this country for
the past three years, and
sometimes | get very frus-
trated at the country’s fail-
ure to invest in human capi-
talin fields that matter most.
This has been the cause of
the so-called Acquired Ex-
Patriate Dependency Syn-
drome(AEDS), described by
Makumbi. There seems to
be a total ignorance even of
what kind Of scientists, tech-
nologists and engineers this
country needs. As a result,
more money is being in-
vested in the training of spe-
Ctalists who end UP roaming
the streets looking for jobs,
instead of focusing on train-
ing job creators.

One fact though, is that
Namibians themselves are
not committed to Serving in
Ow paying Professions,
which albeit, require many

years of training and hard
work. The University of Na-
mibia,can for example, hardly
retain a Namibian witha post-
graduate qualification in eco-
nomics, engineering or IT.
They leave the University for
better paying jobs outside the
University, in the Govern-
mentand private sector. Simi-
larly, most Namibian medical
Practitioners find that Private
Practice is better paying than
working in a Government hos-
pital.

That is why Namibia must
be very thankful for countries
like Cuba which continue (o
send their doctors to work
here, and for those other ex-
Patriates, who leave their
countries to work here. As a
Matter of fact, Namibia is not
the most attractive place for
expatriates to work. Salarics
are generally low, taxation is
very high, and even despite
paying all taxes, expatriates
have no easy access to state
benefits such as basic educa-
tion and medical care. Nota-
bly, many of them are leaving

Namibls for their home coun-
tries or to greener pastures
elsewhere.

My suggestion is that Na-
mibia should invest heavily in
higher education in relevant
fields such as medicine and
engineering.

The present level of Science
and Technology programmes
at the University and the Poly-
technic should be elevated and
cach institution should focus
on its state-given mandate,
and develop human capital in
areas relevant to the coun-
try's development strategy at
their mandated levels. ;

After thirteen years of inde-
pendence, Namibia does not
have a medical faculty nor an
engincering faculty at its uni-
versity.

For three years | have been
at Unam, I have seen zero
investment from Government
in the engineering training.
Even the Polytechnic, with its
recently established engincer-
ing school, lacks essential in-
frastructure and human re-
sources to produce competent

technicians, let alone tech.
nologists. Now they want to
become a university! There
is unnecessary and unwar.
ranted competition between
Unam and Polytechnic
which must be stopped at an
costs.

I wish the Namibian peo.
ple success in this more dif.
ficult phase of socio-eep_
nomic liberation. The pre.
scription for AEDS is invest.
ment in science and technol.

,and empowering higher
inctitutions to hire the besy
brains from anywhere in the
world, so that more
Namtbians can be traineg
locally.

That is what even hi
developed countries like the
USA are doing. Replacing
expatriates with ill-trained,

ngVC3Z586WsD5WMZiWO3gECSZVOKlDiAKWtf5ZCZ,"Questions About Tax Workshop For MPs

IT’S a shock to read that a workshop is being
organised to help parliamentarians to under-
stand the tax return forms.

First of all it appears that this is being done
with Government monies. Secondly parlia-
mentarians get paid loads of money and can
certainly afford the services of tax consultants
in their own private capacity. They will argue
that the more business and private ventures
one has the more complicated the form gets,
but they should have thought about this before
entering into these ventures and this is there-
fore no a valid excuse.

The service that they require is by no means
a public good and is therefore not in the pub-

lic’s interest for Government to fund such a
workshop. If the parliamentarians have prob-
lems understanding the forms and paying tax
consultants to do their returns, how on earth
does the Government expect the ordinary per-
son on the street to fill in the tax return forms?
It would be in public interest to hold nation-
wide workshops for everybody including the
wealthy but stingy parliamentarians on how to
fill in tax return forms. And to bring up this
issue five days before the deadline is preposter-
ous and makes one question our leadership!

a farce this turned out to be.

The explanavions oftered by your Mr

My total assessment rates tor the

N$350,43, which amount included the
so-called OSSC charves, if vour Mr

amount for the penod ended July 1S

MUCH noise has been made about the fourth
term. Everyone with ears who dares to care has
heard the President saying the constitution does
not allow him to stand again. He has said he
would retire at the end of his current term. So that
is not the debate we should be having, instead we
should focus on who will take the mantle further.
For a stast, the Prime Minister should have
moved one step up. But given the fact he has
reduced the weight of the office of the Prime
Minister to only opening anything that needs to |
be opened (public relations events) inthe hope of |
being seen in areas where he has never been seen |
before, and the fact that his wife's business |

tax to the Government as required by law, his

greatest challenge for those
who sull have the power to

our enemy and to resist them

Up unl now, these battles
in the community have been
fought by the elderly, on their
own, with others looking on
as if they are not affected by
water andelectncity cut-offs
Butitis no longer possible to
temain silent on these issues,
for itis the very stuff of life
and history To do nothing
and he down ata tme like
this, would be a betrayal of
our most vital interests

The enemies of the poor
are charging inflated prices
for water and when people
are unable to pay, given the
economic condinon of the
masses. then Council cuts off
our water supply Such cru-
elty and naked barbarism
goes unveiled in Windhoek’s
upper chambers. They are
attempting to tum water into
acommoadity for profitand in
so doing, they are depriving
us of our most natural rehts,
invluding the ght to exsst
They are throwing women

The war against the poor 1s

unspeakable horrors as a re-

There will be no greater

than the current policy of
Council This policy, in es-
sence, 1s to deprive the poor
people of water and sanita-
tion, of land and of the jobs to
sustain ourselves. The policy
of evictions, of water and
electricity cut-offs is above
all hostile to the needs of our
innocent children, who are
always the most vulnerable
to these attacks from the
Council. Water cut-offs are
unconstitutional and a viola-
tion of basic nghts and must
be declared to be so

Since Council has made a
policy of depriving and si-
lently killing the poor by de-
priving us of our basic nghts,

transparency. by asking people to have
afestona voluntary basts, so thatthe y

possible to ask people only to accept
each other, when they are informed
about the status of there partner? The
repular use of condoms should be lett

My points concern AIDS. HIV,
orphan children, street children,
elderly people and lastly the Gov-
ernment’s spending fever. In this
country we as Namibians should

does no even have

across an article in Tie Namibian
of October 22 of how ttle ehil-
dren are being killed by HIV-
AIDS and how orphan children
are increasing. It was sad in the

article that currently there are 82
000 orphan children and that this
figure will double by the year
2015. Andof course another point
is the street children who have
nothing to eat. no place to sleep,
and nowhere to go. [s this prob-
lem the nation’s and 1s it not the
Government's duty to do some-
thing about it. Should this not be
the Government's priority?

The children in our homes are
exactly the same as the children
on the street who are asking for
food and what about the children
thatare in the hospitals with HIV
or AIDS.

Canour Namibian Government
not dv something about this and
bring these problems under con-
trol and try to prevent these prob-
lems.

Can they not do something to
ensure that these problems do not
escalate into even much larger
numbers over the next 10 to 20
veurs?

We have a lack of hospitals.
lack of proper education, while
our Government continues to
build in Windhoek and the other
big towns and they seem to forget
about the smaller rural towns.

We must remember that the old
people that we so easily push aside
are easy targets for robbers and
murderers and if we don't take
care of them properly then who
will? They now have hard umes
Inourcountry but they were look-
ing after us before and now we
need to let them enjoy their rest

Namibtans should be earine for [
our country and we see the Gov-
ernment making lots of mistakes
and misusing their powerand also
funds, but we do nothing.

People like us should be saving

Speeches, Please!

NAMIBIAN voters havea right to be informed inorder
to cast their votes with commitment and maturity as
far as their future is concerned. [tis in that context that
we - again - request “leaders” to stick to the rules of
democracy and free and fair elections.

Mr. Tyirtange, your previous position as Minister of
Justice should have instilled a respect for the Namibian
Constitution in you. That should at least reach as far as
knowing that it is NOT SWAPO that created the
Namibian Defence Force, Police, Civil Service etc. etc.
- that is an obligation every Government of a country
has.

Swapo is just another political party and not the
Government. Sic - we do not live in 1960 anymore - the
year 2044 1s here and we have and want to move on.

We all have an understanding that you might still
fee! bitter about your past - let us, however, look ahead
and rather work for a future that does not bring back
those years. Namibia has so many problems that need
tangible solutions. Solutions will not be found by clinging
on to the past and asking weird questions hke: “What
did Ben Ulenga tell the Boers to be released?”

Absurd statements like “the CoD has been created
by colontalists”.

By the way, Sir, the CoD is a legitimate political
party and not an organisation. You can condemn the
“colonisers” till eternity - as fong as you, the Swapo
party, still depend on them for food assistance for
Namibians your statements boomerang.

Tell the voters why is it necessary to apply for N$37.7
million donor assistance to feed Namibians?

Teli the voters why only foreigners get major building
contracts these days?

Tell the voters why they - after 14 years of
mdependence - stul live in shacks and shambles?

Why is almost every municipality bankrupt in
Nambia? .

Why is each and every parastatal costing the
Namibian taxpayers milhons and millions?

Sir -yvouas former Minister of Justice - should cry out
loud: babies and toddlers are raped on a daily basis.
Criminals rule the country - Namibtans get murdered
for a few dollars - corruption never gets punished.

The hist, Lam afraid, is endless! The Police force ts ill
equipped. ill-trained - why would Windhock otherwise
ask for a Municipal Police Force?

The Namibian Defence Force - whois insane enough
to want to attack Namibia - Nambia does not need that
Force. The money could be spent on housing/educations
health services etc. etc. All these and many more
pressing issues and what can be done about it.

That makes up election material for many months —
Sir-notyour defamations and agitating hate speeches.

Howeser-af your attacks on the CoD are an indicator
to vo by - the Cob is doing a good job and giving you
ample reason to see an opposition in that party,

Mr Tjitianye, please come up with solutions for
Namibians since we all Know that the tax pavers — and
thatincludes opposition party members - pay for Swapo
rallies

We have peace in Namibia - thatis also a credit Co
opposition partes since we can argue in parliament
and don't hase to take up weapons - lets keep it that

Exorbitant Salaries

} HAVE always been
critical of the develop-
ments at Air Namibia.
Tcould nes er understand
why it was necessary
to hire foreigners as
General Managers who
did nothing but run this
company intothe ground
by purchasing the wrong
planes, failing to organ-
ise anefficient service or
ensuring that the aircraft
was on ume.

One of the managers
received an exorbitant
salary of NS 150000 per
month and eventualls
sulla golden handshake
of a few millon when
he left.

All he did for us was
purchase planes that
cannotmake a profitand
thereby create a perma-
nent financial embar-
rassmenttothe companys
and the Namibian State.
I always stated that a
Namibian management
team should be able
to do much better, and
now that a Namibian
management team has
been instated, the result
is that forergn users
of our airline are most
impressed with the ex-

tremely courteous and
friendly service they are
getting on the plane.

They are also im-
pressed by the fact that
the seats leave enough
leg room for the long
distance flights to make
the flight a pleasure and
they are impressed that
the planes are usually
on ume.

It seems that the
present management has
really been successful in
achies ing a turn-around
in the tmage of our
airline and that is why |
write this letter.

To show them that
their efforts are noticed
by the customers and
are appreciated by us as
citizens.

We can now again be
proud of our national
airline.

What one would only
wish, was thata similarly
competent management
team 1s instated at other
parastatals such as Nam-
Post, where we often
pay a ten times higher
postage for our letters,
which then either never
arrive, or even, when
sent by airmail, arrive

10 or 14 days late.

Students often do not
receive theirnoufication
of exam dates on time
and thus miss them.

Shareholders do not
receive the noufications
of shareholder meetings
and income tax forms
are sometimes delayed
causing penalties and
irritation.

NamPost also thinks
they must hold back
letters that were alleg-
edly stamped too low in
foreign countries from
Which they originate,
having the effect that
those letters eventually
arrive on vour desk two
or three months later.

We need managers
in Our parastatals that
can actually manage
and know what they are
doing.

Thousands and thou-
sands of people are
prejudiced if our par-
astatals do not function
properly and merely cost
us money.

ALLOW me space in your
esteemed daily. There has
been disturbing talk and
often exaggerated com-
parision of two northern

that Ongwediva is clean
and well-managed and
one couldn't agree more.
But comparing the two

IS pretty much unfatr.
As far as Lam concerned

are fewer industrial and
business activities tak-

than at Oshakat. To give
an example, Onewediva

has its own open market
where only a few do their
business. Again a size-
able number of working
people residing tn Ong-
wediva either work in
Oshakatl, Ondangwa or
in the surrounding towns
and villages, Ongwediva
included, conduct their
business and do their
shopping. In essence,
masses of Ongwediva
residents also do con-
tribute to the unhy gienic
conditions in Oshakats if
there ts any,
Justimagine how much

hakaul town council to

to Oshakati Municipal-
ity. The odds are that
some people may seek
to score cheap political
points by comparing an
apple to a lemon. One
wonders what Ongwediva
would become without
Oshakat.

In fact Ongwediva is
more like one of Os-
hakati’s suburbs and one
would think that these
ivo towns have a unified
cleaning system, Instead
of competing they must
forge mutual co-opera-
tion, because to me Ong-

f WOULD like to air
my Views through your
newspaper to the Prime
Minister as the head
of the civil service.
Due to the prevalence
of HIV/AIDS and the
high rate of deaths in
Namibia, | would like
to ask our dear Prime
Minister to reduce the
retirement age of civil
servants from 55 years
to 50 vears.

For example | am 53
years Old and forced by
law to hang on until Pm
SS, while | have already
served 35 years and am
spiritually and physi-
cally burnt out. The
doctors said [must hang
on because they cannot
write me otf. Please

dear Prime Minister go
into this matter and give
us a democratic choice,
those who are strong
and productive can go
on even unttl 60.

Those who have start-
ed working al a young
age can be givenachoice
to retire earlier, at least
at 50 years. | also think
that the release of older
people earlier can give
a chance to young edu-
cated people to enter the
civil service.

Only about 10% older
people over 50-60 years
are productive, the other
50% are going to Work
because they are forced
by law to reacha re-
quired age.

Finally dear Prime

Minister, there are agents
going around telling old
people to retire and to
transfer their pension
monies to private insur-
ance companies.

The problem here isthe
very high tax if one with-
draws money from the
fund. About 35% its
deducted. Please let this
practise be stopped. The
GIPF must deal directly
with the pensioner who
wants lo retire. A tay
deduction of 20% can
be considered because
we want to get a decent
pension to go into farm-
ing orlo Start a new
business. | hope this
voice of an ordinary
civil servantcan also be
heard. The government

of today only listens to
the voices of the highly
educated people, there-
fore many documented
ideas and programmes
cannot be implemented
because the people on
the ground are ignored.

Our government must
seriously look into the
current laws regulating
the government pension
fund.

For example a la-
bourer working for 40
\ears is getting NS30
000 (lump sum) and
monthly NS 500.00.
Whatis this? The Prime
Minister, Public Service
Commission, Napwu,
Nantu, Parliamentarians
must look into this mat-
ter. The politicians were

vers clever because thes
de-link and establish
theirown penstonfunds.
Avery zood idea. Please
also think about us.

In conclusion, | urge
my dear Prime Minister
to do at least one good
thing for the public
servants because we do
not know what will hap-
pen after March 2005.
We pray for the new
President Pohamba to
keep the current Prime
Minister for the neat 5
years in the past so that
the public service can
be cleaned. I salute you
Prime Minister Theo-
Ben Gurirab.

WE know that Namibia is officially classified as a less
developed country (LDC) and needs money — plenty
of itin order to cater for its development needs. We
also know that multinationals, such as De Beers, BP,
Shell, cte. have plenty of money, which they are will-
ing to invest,

A recent UN report on human development, which
compares the level of human des clopment among na-
tions, revealed that Namibta has slid down a couple of
places on the world ranking The Nanubian gini coet-
ficient, which mdicates the gap between the poor and
the rich. has also skyrocketed to become the widest in
the world. Although these statsties can be interpreted
differently to suit Vanous perspectives, the one fact
that remains undisputed from whichever perspective
ong looks atit is that the average Namubian’s living
standard has notimproved atall. The question then is
why not? Why could Namibra not make a meanineful
improvement on the wealth of vs natronals? T want to
look at this question from the perspective of muluna-
uonal presence inthe country, because, [strongly belief
they are supposed to be the catalystof development in
any country. Their presence is supposed to boost job
creation, business confidence, financial development.
productivity and further investments.

‘tas clear from the above-stated statusues that the
presence of muttinationals have not boosted Namibia's
wealth creation (poverty eradication) objective.

One of the reasons for this ts that histoncally mult.
nationals are Known for bringing lots of money in, but
sending lots more out - much of it through the back
door’. Itis thts backdoor exit of money from the least
developed countries ke Namibia that destroys their
hopes of ever cradicating pov erty. The backdoor chan-
neling of money 1s done through various means, among

others, embezzlement, diversion of funds, undervalu-
ation of local inputs, false invoicing, non-payment of
taxes, kickbacks and bribery.

for example: We are currently paying extremely
high prices for petrol. Under the current arrangement
all our petrol is coming via South Africa through the
big five - Shell, BP. Engen, Caltex and Total. The base
and landing price calculation is formulated on South
African In Bond Landed Cost IBLC) structure, which
has little, if at all, direct relation to intemational on]
trading prices.

Thts inevitably leads to Nanubians subsidizing the
excessive South African refining margins. This also
enables the oll companies to effectively keep the profits
thatthey make on supplying the fuel to Namibia outside
the country. This diversion of funds 1s one way of back-
door channeling of money, which depriy es the country
of much needed revenue and forces the government
to pass the cost on to the consumer by way of higher
prices al the pumps.

tAxamples of this nature are plenty tn almost all the
sectors of the economy. But whilst we are sll at the
petroleum sector, one should maybe quickly raise an-
otherconcern. Isitteasible fora country like Nambia to
procure anational strategie resource ike petroleum from
a single source (South Africa)? Although not relevant
to the above argument, one needs to critically analy 2e
this concem and maybe create a different platform to
address it. For now, let us scruunsze the operations
of these so-called multinationals and ensure that they
keep human development in Namibia on top of their
agendas

RCC Expansion?

IT’s not April 1. so 1 suppose the story is genuine -
the Roads *Con’-tractor company is diversifying into
property development, and at the auction of municipal
stands held a few days ago. a RCC representative. bid-
ding apparendy on an unlimited budget with taxpayers’
money, bought up a large number of these stands, and
in so doing, inflated prices wildly for the other private
bidders. In fact, he spent NS 8.7 million. Nice to know
the RCC has such an amount available, considering the
recent alleged large-scale misappropriation of funds at
the parastatal, and the massive overpayments for mod-
est jobs done.

[ was wondering if the RCC has ever considered “di-
versifying into road construction, bearing in mind the
current state of our roads, e.g. the seemingly abandoned
Okahandja-Karibib widening. and the gravel roads
around the capital Cevery round trip to the Gamsbereg

Just an idea, before we read later how many millions
the RCC has lost in dodgy property deals.

VD like to commend Mr. Jauch
for the thoughtful, compelling
and accurate reflection on the
deportation of the Bangladeshi
workers, published last Friday,
and] congratulate vou for publish-
ingit. Unfortunately, elsewhere in
the paper. there was an ignorant
attempt at a humorous column
on the same situation.

lt is much to be regretted that
Namubtans, if they think about
the matter at all, simply assume
the Bangladeshis to be foreign
trouble-makers who should tm-
mediately be pot rid of. So little
has been learned from history,
as Mr. Jauch says. We have also
the totally bizarre situation where
irregular work visa, employment
contracts and worker ‘accom-
modation” was seemingly all
organised within one Namibian
family - surely this should be
Invesiigated.

And we have thisequally bizarre
company Ramatex, which seems
to he a state within a State.

Actually I would like to sug-
gest a solution to all this. Let us

just go into the Ramatex facility,

deport the management, and ¢s-
propriate itit. Nothing wrong with
this, despite what the IMF might
say. since in terms of subsidies.
erants, incentives and tax breaks
we have bought the place several
times over.

Run the operation with Na-
mibian manapement, and contin-
ue to supply Ramatex’s overseas
customers as before.

We presumably could sell the
stuff more cheaply since we would
eliminate the huge cut taken by the
present Malaysian involvement.
The staff would then be protected
by Namibian lahour law and be
treated decently, and even the
waste products would be treated
decently. Why not try?
